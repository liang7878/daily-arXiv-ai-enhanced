### [1] [Large Language Models are Highly Aligned with Human Ratings of Emotional Stimuli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14214)
*Mattson Ogg,Chace Ashcraft,Ritwik Bose,Raphael Norman-Tenazas,Michael Wolmetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究多种流行大语言模型对含情感刺激的评估，发现GPT - 4o与人类在多数情况下响应相似，LLM在五分类情绪框架中与人类对齐更好，且LLM评分更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在探讨大语言模型融入日常生活时，需了解其对含情感刺激的评估，以明确其在特定角色或交互中的有效性。

Method: 从多种流行大语言模型中获取对先前由人类评估过情感内容的单词和图像数据集的评分。

Result: GPT - 4o在多数情况下与人类响应相似；唤醒度评分对齐较差，幸福度评分对齐度最高；LLM在五分类情绪框架中比二维框架对齐更好；LLM评分比人类更一致。

Conclusion: 研究描述了大语言模型对情感刺激的解读，凸显了生物与人工智能在关键行为领域的异同。

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

### [2] [Explaining Hitori Puzzles: Neurosymbolic Proof Staging for Sequential Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14294)
*Maria Leonor Pacheco,Fabio Somenzi,Dananjay Srinivas,Ashutosh Trivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结合决策程序和大语言模型的神经符号方法来解释复杂决策序列，以Hitori谜题验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 找到一种有效解释复杂决策序列的方法。

Method: 结合决策程序和大语言模型的神经符号方法，用Hitori谜题进行验证。

Result: 实现了辅助人类解决Hitori谜题的工具，有实验证据证明其有效性。

Conclusion: 该神经符号方法可有效解释复杂决策序列。

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

### [3] [Automated Optimization Modeling through Expert-Guided Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14410)
*Beinuo Yang,Qishen Zhou,Junyi Li,Xingchen Su,Simon Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出优化建模存在的问题，通过完善数据集、引入新基准和提出 ORThought 框架解决问题，且该框架表现出色并给出分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化建模过程耗时易错且依赖专家，现有大语言模型解决方法存在高标注错误率、评估范围窄和计算效率低等问题。

Method: 完善现有数据集，引入物流领域新基准 LogiOR，提出 ORThought 框架利用思维链推理自动化优化建模过程。

Result: ORThought 框架在复杂优化问题上优于现有方法，包括多智能体框架。

Conclusion: 对方法进行系统分析，确定成功因素和失败模式，为基于大语言模型的优化建模研究提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

### [4] [The Agent Behavior: Model, Governance and Challenges in the AI Digital Age](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14415)
*Qiang Zhang,Pei Yan,Yijia Xu,Chuanpo Fu,Yong Fang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI发展使网络环境中智能体行为接近人类，带来诸多挑战。本文提出网络行为生命周期模型、A4A范式和HABD模型，验证其有效性并探讨未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI发展使网络环境中智能体与人类行为界限模糊带来的信任、责任、伦理和安全等挑战。

Method: 提出“网络行为生命周期”模型分析人类与智能体各阶段行为差异，引入“A4A”范式和“HABD”模型从5个维度研究两者行为区别，用实际案例验证。

Result: 通过红队渗透、蓝队防御等实际案例验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 探讨了动态认知治理架构、行为差异量化和元治理协议栈等未来研究方向，为安全可信的人机协作提供理论基础和技术路线。

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

### [5] [Who Sees What? Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14564)
*Luca Annese,Sabrina Patania,Silvia Serino,Tom Foulsham,Silvia Rossi,Azzurra Ruggeri,Dimitri Ognibene*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究用Fast Downward规划器生成的结构化示例提升基于大语言模型（LLM）的自主代理在ReAct框架中的视角采择能力，发现结构化示例单独使用不足以实现稳健视角采择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的系统在涉及主动感知、协作推理和视角采择的任务上存在挑战，需提升其性能。

Method: 提出结构化解决方案处理流程，生成G、E、L三类示例，并将其转换为“思考 - 行动”示例。

Result: L型示例略微减少澄清请求和行动步骤，但无持续改善效果；代理在基本注意力过滤任务成功，但在需要心智化和权衡认知行动成本的场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 结构化示例单独使用不足以实现稳健视角采择，需要显式信念跟踪、成本建模和更丰富环境来实现基于LLM代理的社交协作。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

### [6] [LeanGeo: Formalizing Competitional Geometry problems in Lean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14644)
*Chendong Song,Zihan Wang,Frederick Pu,Haiming Wang,Xiaohan Lin,Junqi Liu,Jia Li,Zhengying Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍了用于形式化和解决竞赛级几何问题的统一形式系统LeanGeo及其基准LeanGeo - Bench，评估了大语言模型能力，指出自动几何推理需进一步发展并开源相关内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有几何求解系统难以在统一框架表达问题，与其他数学领域集成困难，且几何问题验证具挑战性。

Method: 引入基于Lean 4定理证明器的LeanGeo，构建含高级几何定理的综合库，创建形式化几何基准LeanGeo - Bench。

Result: 评估了大语言模型在基准上的能力和局限。

Conclusion: 自动几何推理需进一步发展。

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

### [7] [Entropy-Constrained Strategy Optimization in Urban Floods: A Multi-Agent Framework with LLM and Knowledge Graph Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14654)
*Peilin Ji,Xiao Xue,Simeng Wang,Wenhao Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 极端城市降雨事件频发挑战应急调度系统，现有方法存不足，提出H - J框架，实验显示其性能优于基线方法，凸显基于LLM方法在城市洪水响应中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端城市降雨使应急调度面临挑战，现有方法在权衡目标、适应环境和策略可靠性方面有不足，且未统一感知、优化和协调。

Method: 引入H - J分层多智能体框架，集成知识引导提示、熵约束生成和反馈驱动优化，建立从多源感知到策略执行和持续改进的闭环管道。

Result: 在三种降雨条件下对H - J进行评估，结果显示其在交通流畅性、任务成功率和系统鲁棒性上优于基于规则和强化学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的不确定性感知、知识约束方法对增强城市洪水响应恢复力有前景。

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

### [8] [MCP-Universe: Benchmarking Large Language Models with Real-World Model Context Protocol Servers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14704)
*Ziyang Luo,Zhiqi Shen,Wenzhuo Yang,Zirui Zhao,Prathyusha Jwalapuram,Amrita Saha,Doyen Sahoo,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Junnan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MCP-Universe基准评估大语言模型与MCP服务器交互表现，发现领先模型有局限，开源评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准过于简单，无法捕捉长程推理和大而陌生工具空间等实际应用挑战。

Method: 引入MCP - Universe基准，涵盖6个核心领域11个MCP服务器，实现基于执行的评估器。

Result: 领先模型如GPT - 5、Grok - 4和Claude - 4.0 - Sonnet有显著性能局限，带来长上下文和未知工具挑战，企业级代理表现不佳。

Conclusion: 开源可扩展评估框架，支持UI，促进MCP生态创新。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出基于PAC学习范式的数据驱动方法，确定离散抽象为Mealy机的CPS在有限时间步的安全概率，并通过案例验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPS缺乏合适模型且手动提取困难，数据驱动方法可解决诊断和验证问题。

Method: 基于PAC学习范式，采用主动学习，在初始学习集后有导向地采样新数据。

Result: 建立离散逻辑与系统概率可达性分析的联系，为确定的概率提供额外置信度。

Conclusion: 通过自动化车道保持系统案例验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

*Siyuan Song,Harvey Lederman,Jennifer Hu,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 从新定义探讨AI内省，用实验表明大语言模型不符合新定义的内省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型能否内省是重要问题，但内省定义缺乏共识。

Method: 提出AI内省的新定义，通过大语言模型对内部温度参数推理的实验验证。

Result: 大语言模型看似有轻量级内省，但不符合新定义的有意义内省。

Conclusion: 采用新定义衡量，大语言模型未实现有意义的内省。

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

### [11] [Accelerating K-Core Computation in Temporal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14147)

Motivation: 现有解决方案在枚举所有时态k - 核时效率和可扩展性较差。

Method: 基于核心时间的概念，提出一种新算法来计算所有时态k - 核。

Result: 证明算法运行时间受所有结果时态k - 核大小的限制，计算核心时间的成本较低。

Conclusion: 算法的整体运行时间与结果大小密切相关，且该算法在这种情况下是最优的。

Abstract: We address the problem of enumerating all temporal k-cores given a query time
range and a temporal graph, which suffers from poor efficiency and scalability
in the state-of-the-art solution. Motivated by an existing concept called core
times, we propose a novel algorithm to compute all temporal $k$-cores based on
core times and prove that the algorithmic running time is bounded by the size
of all resulting temporal k-cores, which is optimal in this scenario.
Meanwhile, we show that the cost of computing core times is much lower, which
demonstrates the close relevance between our overall running time and the
result size.

TL;DR: 本文针对异质信息网络（HINs）引入有大小约束的社区搜索问题，提出 (k, P)-truss 模型，证明问题为 NP 难，开发 B&B 框架和启发式算法，提出两种精确算法，实验验证方法有效性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 HIN 社区搜索工作大多忽略了实际中因资源有限而存在的大小约束问题，因此引入有大小约束的社区搜索问题。

Method: 提出 (k, P)-truss 模型衡量社区凝聚力；开发 B&B 框架生成目标节点集；设计启发式算法获取初始解；提出两种精确算法分别枚举边和节点组合。

Result: 证明问题是 NP 难；所提算法能有效且高效地找到满足条件的社区。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在真实数据集上的实验中展现出了有效性和效率。

Abstract: The goal of community search in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is
to identify a set of closely related target nodes that includes a query target
node. In practice, a size constraint is often imposed due to limited resources,
which has been overlooked by most existing HIN community search works. In this
paper, we introduce the size-bounded community search problem to HIN data.
Specifically, we propose a refined (k, P)-truss model to measure community
cohesiveness, aiming to identify the most cohesive community of size s that
contains the query node. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. To solve this
problem, we develop a novel B\&B framework that efficiently generates target
node sets of size s. We then tailor novel bounding, branching, total ordering,
and candidate reduction optimisations, which enable the framework to
efficiently lead to an optimum result. We also design a heuristic algorithm
leveraging structural properties of HINs to efficiently obtain a high-quality
initial solution, which serves as a global lower bound to further enhance the
above optimisations. Building upon these, we propose two exact algorithms that
enumerate combinations of edges and nodes, respectively. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前来源多项式实现处理聚合和嵌套查询有局限，且与单一数据库管理系统紧密耦合，阻碍互操作性和广泛应用。

Method: 提出基于查询重写的方法为 SQL 查询添加来源多项式注释，通过来源注释的递归传播支持 SPJUA 操作和嵌套查询，且独立于数据库管理系统。

Result: 该解决方案全面实现文献中提出的理论形式，性能和可扩展性得到提升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效，能实现理论形式，且性能和可扩展性良好。

Abstract: In today's data-driven ecosystems, ensuring data integrity, traceability and
accountability is important. Provenance polynomials constitute a powerful
formalism for tracing the origin and the derivations made to produce database
query results. Despite their theoretical expressiveness, current
implementations have limitations in handling aggregations and nested queries,
and some of them and tightly coupled to a single Database Management System
(DBMS), hindering interoperability and broader applicability.
  This paper presents a query rewriting-based approach for annotating
Structured Query Language (SQL) queries with provenance polynomials. The
proposed methods are DBMS-independent and support
Select-Projection-Join-Union-Aggregation (SPJUA) operations and nested queries,
through recursive propagation of provenance annotations. This constitutes the
first full implementation of semiring-based theory for provenance polynomials
extended with semimodule structures. It also presents an experimental
evaluation to assess the validity of the proposed methods and compare the
performance against state-of-the-art systems using benchmark data and queries.
The results indicate that our solution delivers a comprehensive implementation
of the theoretical formalisms proposed in the literature, and demonstrates
improved performance and scalability, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: 仅用局部知识可将有限可见性机器人部署到满足条件顶点，所提算法能有效填充图的最小顶点覆盖。

Abstract: In a connected graph with an autonomous robot swarm with limited visibility,
it is natural to ask whether the robots can be deployed to certain vertices
satisfying a given property using only local knowledge. This paper
affirmatively answers the question with a set of \emph{myopic} (finite
visibility range) luminous robots with the aim of \emph{filling a minimal
vertex cover} (MVC) of a given graph $G = (V, E)$. The graph has special
vertices, called \emph{doors}, through which robots enter sequentially.
Starting from the doors, the goal of the robots is to settle on a set of
vertices that forms a minimal vertex cover of $G$ under the asynchronous
($\mathcal{ASYNC}$) scheduler. We are also interested in achieving the
\emph{minimum vertex cover} (MinVC, which is NP-hard \cite{Karp1972} for
general graphs) for a specific graph class using the myopic robots. We
establish lower bounds on the visibility range for the robots and on the time
complexity (which is $\Omega(|E|)$). We present two algorithms for trees: one
for single door, which is both time and memory-optimal, and the other for
multiple doors, which is memory-optimal and achieves time-optimality when the
number of doors is a constant. Interestingly, our technique achieves MinVC on
trees with a single door. We then move to the general graph, where we present
two algorithms, one for the single door and the other for the multiple doors
with an extra memory of $O(\log \Delta)$ for the robots, where $\Delta$ is the
maximum degree of $G$. All our algorithms run in $O(|E|)$ epochs.

Conclusion: 成功将可审计性概念扩展到多种共享对象，展示了不同共享对象在可审计性方面的实现和关联。

Abstract: Auditability allows to track operations performed on a shared object,
recording who accessed which information. This gives data owners more control
on their data. Initially studied in the context of single-writer registers,
this work extends the notion of auditability to other shared objects, and
studies their properties.
  We start by moving from single-writer to multi-writer registers, and provide
an implementation of an auditable $n$-writer $m$-reader read / write register,
with $O(n+m)$ step complexity. This implementation uses $(m+n)$-sliding
registers, which have consensus number $m+n$. We show that this consensus
number is necessary. The implementation extends naturally to support an
auditable load-linked / store-conditional (LL/SC) shared object. LL/SC is a
primitive that supports efficient implementation of many shared objects.
Finally, we relate auditable registers to other access control objects, by
implementing an anti-flickering deny list from auditable registers.

Result: 从纯数据空间中产生了自然数、整数等熟悉的经典数学对象。

Conclusion: 可基于这些例子探索理论的新方向和进行新的研究。

Abstract: In a previous work, "pure data" is proposed as an axiomatic foundation for
mathematics and computing, based on "finite sequence" as the foundational
concept rather than based on logic or type. Within this framework, objects with
mathematical meaning are "data" and collections of mathematical objects must
then be associative data, called a "space." A space is then the basic
collection in this framework analogous to sets in Set Theory or objects in
Category Theory. A theory of spaces is developed,where spaces are studied via
their semiring of endomorphisms. To illustrate these concepts, and as a way of
exploring the implications of the framework, pure data spaces are "grown
organically" from the substrate of pure data with minimal combinatoric
definitions. Familiar objects from classical mathematics emerge this way,
including natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, boolean spaces, matrix
algebras, Gaussian Integers, Quaternions, and non-associative algebras like the
Integer Octonions. Insights from these examples are discussed with a view
towards new directions in theory and new exploration.

Result: 在大规模真实和合成图上进行了全面评估，评估了结果延迟、解决方案稳定性和吞吐量。

Conclusion: 未明确提及，但暗示新算法在处理动态单源最短路径问题上有一定优势。

Abstract: Modern graphs are both large and dynamic, presenting significant challenges
for fundamental queries, such as the Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
problem. Naively recomputing the SSSP tree after each topology change is
prohibitively expensive, causing on-demand computation to suffer from high
latency. Existing dynamic SSSP algorithms often cannot simultaneously handle
both edge additions and deletions, operate in distributed memory, and provide
low-latency query results. To address these challenges, this paper presents
SSSP-Del, a new vertex-centric, asynchronous, and fully distributed algorithm
for dynamic SSSP. Operating in a shared-nothing architecture, our algorithm
processes streams of both edge insertions and deletions. We conduct a
comprehensive evaluation on large real-world and synthetic graphs with millions
of vertices, and provide a thorough analysis by evaluating result latency,
solution stability, and throughput.

Conclusion: MOHAF具有近似线性可扩展性、理论保证和强大的实证性能，是大规模物联网部署中协调分布式资源的实用且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has intensified the
challenge of efficiently allocating heterogeneous resources in highly dynamic,
distributed environments. Conventional centralized mechanisms and
single-objective auction models, focusing solely on metrics such as cost
minimization or revenue maximization, struggle to deliver balanced system
performance. This paper proposes the Multi-Objective Hierarchical Auction
Framework (MOHAF), a distributed resource allocation mechanism that jointly
optimizes cost, Quality of Service (QoS), energy efficiency, and fairness.
MOHAF integrates hierarchical clustering to reduce computational complexity
with a greedy, submodular optimization strategy that guarantees a (1-1/e)
approximation ratio. A dynamic pricing mechanism adapts in real time to
resource utilization, enhancing market stability and allocation quality.
Extensive experiments on the Google Cluster Data trace, comprising 3,553
requests and 888 resources, demonstrate MOHAF's superior allocation efficiency
(0.263) compared to Greedy (0.185), First-Price (0.138), and Random (0.101)
auctions, while achieving perfect fairness (Jain's index = 1.000). Ablation
studies reveal the critical influence of cost and QoS components in sustaining
balanced multi-objective outcomes. With near-linear scalability, theoretical
guarantees, and robust empirical performance, MOHAF offers a practical and
adaptable solution for large-scale IoT deployments, effectively reconciling
efficiency, equity, and sustainability in distributed resource coordination.

Method: 构建由多本地链和主链组成的PyloChain，本地链并行执行交易，主链用DAG - 基内存池保证可用性和执行全局交易，采用调度技术减少本地事务中止，提供细粒度审计机制。

Result: 实现并评估PyloChain，吞吐量高1.49倍，延迟快2.63倍。

Conclusion: PyloChain能有效平衡可用性和性能，提升区块链可扩展性。

Abstract: Blockchain networks offer decentralization, transparency, and immutability
for managing critical data but encounter scalability problems as the number of
network members and transaction issuers grows. Sharding is considered a
promising solution to enhance blockchain scalability. However, most existing
blockchain sharding techniques prioritize performance at the cost of
availability (e.g., a failure in a few servers holding a shard leads to data
unavailability). In this paper, we propose PyloChain, a hierarchical sharded
blockchain that balances availability and performance. PyloChain consists of
multiple lower-level local chains and one higher-level main chain. Each local
chain speculatively executes local transactions to achieve high parallelism
across multiple local chains. The main chain leverages a directed-acyclic-graph
(DAG)-based mempool to guarantee local block availability and to enable
efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to execute global (or
cross-shard) transactions within a collocated sharding. PyloChain speculatively
executes local transactions across multiple local chains to achieve high
parallelism. In order to reduce the number of aborted local transactions,
PyloChain applies a simple scheduling technique to handle global transactions
in the main chain. PyloChain provides a fine-grained auditing mechanism to
mitigate faulty higher-level members by externalizing main chain operations to
lower-level local members. We implemented and evaluated PyloChain,
demonstrating its performance scalability with 1.49x higher throughput and
2.63x faster latency compared to the state-of-the-art balanced hierarchical
sharded blockchain.

Motivation: PCN可缓解区块链可扩展性问题，但需精心设计网络拓扑以最大化交易吞吐量，用户也需优化交易转发决策，因此要解决PCN拓扑设计和交易决策以最小化成本。

Result: 得到O(p)近似算法，在特定假设下可将近似比降至O(√p)。

Conclusion: 所提算法能在PCN拓扑设计和交易决策问题上达到一定近似效果，实证研究支持了相关假设和方法。

Abstract: Payment channel networks (PCNs) are a promising technology that alleviates
blockchain scalability by shifting the transaction load from the blockchain to
the PCN. Nevertheless, the network topology has to be carefully designed to
maximise the transaction throughput in PCNs. Additionally, users in PCNs also
have to make optimal decisions on which transactions to forward and which to
reject to prolong the lifetime of their channels. In this work, we consider an
input sequence of transactions over $p$ parties. Each transaction consists of a
transaction size, source, and target, and can be either accepted or rejected
(entailing a cost). The goal is to design a PCN topology among the $p$
cooperating parties, along with the channel capacities, and then output a
decision for each transaction in the sequence to minimise the cost of creating
and augmenting channels, as well as the cost of rejecting transactions. Our
main contribution is an $\mathcal{O}(p)$ approximation algorithm for the
problem with $p$ parties. We further show that with some assumptions on the
distribution of transactions, we can reduce the approximation ratio to
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{p})$. We complement our theoretical analysis with an
empirical study of our assumptions and approach in the context of the Lightning
Network.

Abstract: In recent years, cloud providers have introduced novel approaches for trading
virtual machines. For example, Virtustream introduced so-called muVMs to charge
cloud computing resources while other providers such as Google, Microsoft, or
Amazon re-invented their marketspaces. Today, the market leader Amazon runs six
marketspaces for trading virtual machines. Consumers can purchase bundles of
virtual machines, which are called cloud-portfolios, from multiple marketspaces
and providers. An industry-relevant field of research is to identify best
practices and guidelines on how such optimal portfolios are created. In the
paper at hand, a cost analysis of cloud portfolios is presented. Therefore,
pricing data from Amazon was used as well as a real virtual machine utilization
dataset from the Bitbrains datacenter. The results show that a cost optimum can
only be reached if heterogeneous portfolios are created where virtual machines
are purchased from different marketspaces. Additionally, the cost-benefit of
migrating virtual machines to different marketplaces during runtime is
presented. Such migrations are especially cost-effective for virtual machines
of cloud-portfolios which run between 6 hours and 1 year. The paper further
shows that most of the resources of virtual machines are never utilized by
consumers, which represents a significant future potential for cost
optimization. For the validation of the results, a second dataset of the
Bitbrains datacenter was used, which contains utility data of virtual machines
from a different domain of application.

Method: 估算七个真实Nextflow工作流在不同集群上的碳足迹，评估碳感知时间转移、暂停恢复工作流影响，对工作流和任务应用资源缩放。

Result: 时间转移可减少超80%排放，资源缩放可减少67%排放。

Conclusion: 科学工作流采用碳感知执行策略能显著降低碳排放。

Abstract: Scientific workflows are widely used to automate scientific data analysis and
often involve computationally intensive processing of large datasets on compute
clusters. As such, their execution tends to be long-running and
resource-intensive, resulting in substantial energy consumption and, depending
on the energy mix, carbon emissions. Meanwhile, a wealth of carbon-aware
computing methods have been proposed, yet little work has focused specifically
on scientific workflows, even though they present a substantial opportunity for
carbon-aware computing because they are often significantly delay tolerant,
efficiently interruptible, highly scalable and widely heterogeneous. In this
study, we first exemplify the problem of carbon emissions associated with
running scientific workflows, and then show the potential for carbon-aware
workflow execution. For this, we estimate the carbon footprint of seven
real-world Nextflow workflows executed on different cluster infrastructures
using both average and marginal carbon intensity data. Furthermore, we
systematically evaluate the impact of carbon-aware temporal shifting, and the
pausing and resuming of the workflow. Moreover, we apply resource scaling to
workflows and workflow tasks. Finally, we report the potential reduction in
overall carbon emissions, with temporal shifting capable of decreasing
emissions by over 80%, and resource scaling capable of decreasing emissions by
67%.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the
optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to
sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$,
there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde
O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any
$A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability,
$(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all
$x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic
factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current
matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a
broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call
iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment
bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya
and van Handel, GAFA 2024].

Motivation: 前人研究在在线排序问题上留下上下界的指数差距，本文旨在解决该问题。

Method: 给出两种确定性算法，一是当m = (1+ε) n时的O(log²n / ε)竞争比算法，二是当m = γn（γ在[O(1), O(log²n)]）时的O(log²n / γ)竞争比算法。

Result: 得到接近最优的空间与竞争比权衡，即竞争比与γ乘积上界为O(log²n)，下界为Ω(log n / log log n)，结果可扩展到未知数值范围，竞争比增加O(log n)因子。

Conclusion: 几乎完全解决在线排序问题，得到了该问题在不同空间下的近最优竞争比算法及其拓展情况。

Abstract: In the online sorting problem, a sequence of $n$ numbers in $[0, 1]$
(including $\{0,1\}$) have to be inserted in an array of size $m \ge n$ so as
to minimize the sum of absolute differences between pairs of numbers occupying
consecutive non-empty cells. Previously, Aamand {\em et al.} (SODA 2023) gave a
deterministic $2^{\sqrt{\log n} \sqrt{\log \log n + \log
(1/\varepsilon)}}$-competitive algorithm when $m = (1+\varepsilon) n$ for any
$\varepsilon \ge \Omega(\log n/n)$. They also showed a lower bound: with $m =
\gamma n$ space, the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm is at
least $\frac{1}{\gamma}\cdot\Omega(\log n / \log \log n)$. This left an
exponential gap between the upper and lower bounds for the problem.
  In this paper, we bridge this exponential gap and almost completely resolve
the online sorting problem. First, we give a deterministic $O(\log^2 n /
\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm with $m = (1+\varepsilon) n$, for any
$\varepsilon \ge \Omega(\log n / n)$. Next, for $m = \gamma n$ where $\gamma =
[O(1), O(\log^2 n)]$, we give a deterministic $O(\log^2 n /
\gamma)$-competitive algorithm. In particular, this implies an
$O(1)$-competitive algorithm with $O(n \log^2 n)$ space, which is within an
$O(\log n\cdot \log \log n)$ factor of the lower bound of $\Omega(n \log n /
\log \log n)$. Combined, the two results imply a close to optimal tradeoff
between space and competitive ratio for the entire range of interest:
specifically, an upper bound of $O(\log^2 n)$ on the product of the competitive
ratio and $\gamma$ while the lower bound on this product is $\Omega(\log n /
\log\log n)$. We also show that these results can be extended to the case when
the range of the numbers is not known in advance, for an additional $O(\log n)$
factor in the competitive ratio.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of approximating the $k$-disc
distribution (``frequency vector") of a bounded-degree graph in sublinear-time
under the assumption of hyperfiniteness. We revisit the partition-oracle
framework of Hassidim, Kelner, Nguyen, and Onak \cite{hassidim2009local}, and
provide a concise, self-contained analysis that explicitly separates the two
sources of error: (i) the cut error, controlled by hyperfiniteness parameter
$\phi$, which incurs at most $\varepsilon/2$ in $\ell_1$-distance by removing
at most $\phi |V|$ edges; and (ii) the sampling error, controlled by the
accuracy parameter $\varepsilon$, bounded by $\varepsilon/2$ via
$N=\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$ random vertex queries and a Chernoff and union
bound argument. Combining these yields an overall $\ell_1$-error of
$\varepsilon$ with high probability. Algorithmically, we show that by sampling
$N=\lceil C\varepsilon^{-2} \rceil$ vertices and querying the local partition
oracle, one can in time $poly(d,k,\varepsilon^{-1})$ construct a summary graph
$H$ of size $|H|=poly(d^k,1/\varepsilon)$ whose $k$-disc frequency vector
approximates that of the original graph within $\varepsilon$ in
$\ell_1$-distance. Our approach clarifies the dependence of both runtime and
summary-size on the parameter $d$,$k$, and $\varepsilon$.

Abstract: We study the online sorting problem, where $n$ real numbers arrive in an

numbers are placed into the array, the cost is defined as the sum over the
absolute differences of all $n-1$ pairs of adjacent numbers in the array,
ignoring empty array cells. Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta, and Kleist introduced
the problem and obtained a deterministic algorithm with cost
$2^{O\left(\sqrt{\log n \cdot\log\log n +\log \varepsilon^{-1}}\right)}$, and a
lower bound of $\Omega(\log n / \log\log n)$ for deterministic algorithms. We
obtain a deterministic algorithm with quasi-polylogarithmic cost
$\left(\varepsilon^{-1}\log n\right)^{O\left(\log \log n\right)}$.

Abstract: Palindromes are strings that read the same forward and backward. The
computation of palindromic structures within strings is a fundamental problem
in string algorithms, being motivated by potential applications in formal
language theory and bioinformatics. Although the number of palindromic factors
in a string of length $n$ can be quadratic, they can be implicitly represented
in $O(n \log n)$ bits of space by storing the lengths of all maximal
palindromes in an integer array, which can be computed in $O(n)$ time
[Manacher, 1975]. In this paper, we propose a novel $O(n)$-bit representation
of all maximal palindromes in a string, which enables $O(1)$-time retrieval of
the length of the maximal palindrome centered at any given position. Since
Manacher's algorithm and the notion of maximal palindromes are widely utilized
for solving numerous problems involving palindromic structures, our compact
representation will accelerate the development of more space-efficient
solutions. Indeed, as the first application of our compact representation of
maximal palindromes, we present a data structure of size $O(n)$ bits that can
compute the longest palindrome appearing in any given factor of the string in
$O(\log n)$ time.

Motivation: 捕捉基础设施的渐进式转变或更新。

Result: 算法为有界曲率和/或通用子模比的效用函数得出有竞争力的解。

Conclusion: 增量 - 减量最大化比增量最大化困难得多。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for incremental-decremental maximization that
captures the gradual transformation or renewal of infrastructures. In our
model, an initial solution is transformed one element at a time and the utility
of an intermediate solution is given by the sum of the utilities of the
transformed and untransformed parts. We propose a simple randomized and a
deterministic algorithm that both find an order in which to transform the
elements while maintaining a large utility during all stages of transformation,
relative to an optimum solution for the current stage. More specifically, our
algorithms yield competitive solutions for utility functions of bounded
curvature and/or generic submodularity ratio, and, in particular, for
submodular functions, and gross substitute functions. Our results exhibit that
incremental-decremental maximization is substantially more difficult than
incremental maximization.

TL;DR: 本文研究P|pmtn, setup=s_i|C_max问题，给出(4/3+ε)近似算法，改进此前结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决P|pmtn, setup=s_i|C_max这一NP难问题，优化该问题的近似比。

Method: 先将实例划分为易处理和难处理部分，计算易处理部分的4/3T近似解，证明存在满足特定性质的4/3T近似解，最后得到通用实例的(4/3+ε)近似算法。

Result: 给出了运行时间为O(n^2 log(1/ε))的(4/3+ε)近似算法，在ε < 1/6时，改进了该问题此前3/2的最佳近似比。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能有效解决P|pmtn, setup=s_i|C_max问题，且近似比优于之前结果。

Abstract: We consider the $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problem $\mathrm{P} \mathbf{\vert}
\mathrm{pmtn, setup=s_i} \mathbf{\vert} \mathrm{C_{\max}}$, the problem of
scheduling $n$ jobs, which are divided into $c$ classes, on $m$ identical
parallel machines while allowing preemption. For each class $i$ of the $c$
classes, we are given a setup time $s_i$ that is required to be scheduled
whenever a machine switches from processing a job of one class to a job from
another class. The goal is to find a schedule that minimizes the makespan.
  We give a $(4/3+\varepsilon)$-approximate algorithm with run time in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log(1/\varepsilon))$. For any $\varepsilon < 1/6$, this
improves upon the previously best known approximation ratio of $3/2$ for this
problem.
  Our main technical contributions are as follows. We first partition any
instance into an "easy" and a "hard" part, such that a $4/3 T$-approximation
for the former is easy to compute for some given makespan $T$. We then proceed
to show our main structural result, namely that there always exists a $4/3
T$-approximation for any instance that has a solution with makespan $T$, where
the hard part has some easy to compute properties. Finally, we obtain an
algorithm that computes a $(4/3+\varepsilon)$-approximation in time n
$\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log(1/\varepsilon))$ for general instances by computing
solutions with the previously shown structural properties.

Conclusion: 不同算法在室友匹配问题中有不同表现，特定偏好结构可降低2人稳定分配求解复杂度。

Abstract: In the roommate matching model, given a set of 2n agents and n rooms, we find
an assignment of a pair of agents to a room. Although the roommate matching
problem is well studied, the study of the model when agents have preference
over both rooms and roommates was recently initiated by Chan et al. [11]. We
study two types of stable roommate assignments, namely, 4-person stable (4PS)
and 2-person stable (2PS) in conjunction with efficiency and
strategy-proofness. We design a simple serial dictatorship based algorithm for
finding a 4PS assignment that is Pareto optimal and strategy-proof. However,
the serial dictatorship algorithm is far from being 2PS. Next, we study top
trading cycle (TTC) based algorithms. We show that variations of TTC cannot be
strategy-proof or PO. Finally, as Chan et al. (2016) showed that deciding the
existence of 2PS assignment is NP-complete, we identify preference structures
where a 2PS assignment can be found in polynomial time.

Motivation: 现有信息设计最优方案复杂难审计和沟通，需提出可解释方案。

Result: 可解释性价格最坏情况为1/2；精确优化问题一般是NP难，特定效用函数有近似算法。

Conclusion: 可解释信息设计在性能和计算上有一定保障，分区信号方案表现较好。

Abstract: The optimal signaling schemes in information design (Bayesian persuasion)
problems often involve non-explainable randomization or disconnected partitions
of state space, which are too intricate to be audited or communicated. We
propose explainable information design in the context of information design
with a continuous state space, restricting the information designer to use
$K$-partitional signaling schemes defined by deterministic and monotone
partitions of the state space, where a unique signal is sent for all states in
each part. We first prove that the price of explainability (PoE) -- the ratio
between the performances of the optimal explainable signaling scheme and
unrestricted signaling scheme -- is exactly $1/2$ in the worst case, meaning
that partitional signaling schemes are never worse than arbitrary signaling
schemes by a factor of 2.
  We then study the complexity of computing optimal explainable signaling
schemes. We show that the exact optimization problem is NP-hard in general. But
for Lipschitz utility functions, an $\varepsilon$-approximately optimal
explainable signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time. And for
piecewise constant utility functions, we provide an efficient algorithm to find
an explainable signaling scheme that provides a $1/2$ approximation to the
optimal unrestricted signaling scheme, which matches the worst-case PoE bound.
  A technical tool we develop is a conversion from any optimal signaling scheme
(which satisfies a bi-pooling property) to a partitional signaling scheme that
achieves $1/2$ fraction of the expected utility of the former. We use this tool
in the proofs of both our PoE result and algorithmic result.

Abstract: We study payoff manipulation in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games,
where a leader may strategically influence a follower's deterministic best
response, e.g., by offering a share of their own payoff. We assume that the
follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives,
is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through
interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the
leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility
maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based
on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide
the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off
short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated
interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results
across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative
leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without
requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility
function.

Conclusion: 该基准为研究金融复杂特定领域任务中以检索为中心的LLM行为奠定基础，后续会公开并拓展数据集。

Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain,
where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of
documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in
retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but
also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and
domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the
model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is
most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate
such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce
FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with
multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The
benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms
and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document
type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected
document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning
steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a
quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.
We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how
targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.
Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior
in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset
publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for
the full S&P 500 and beyond.

Result: 在真实游戏数据集上的实验表明DP2Rec在推荐准确性和多样性上超过现有方法。

Conclusion: DP2Rec模型能有效联合优化推荐的准确性和多样性。

Abstract: The explosive growth of the video game industry has created an urgent need
for recommendation systems that can scale with expanding catalogs and maintain
user engagement. While prior work has explored accuracy and diversity in
recommendations, existing models underutilize playtime, a rich behavioral
signal unique to gaming platforms, and overlook the potential of multimodal
information to enhance diversity. In this paper, we propose DP2Rec, a novel
Dual-Phase Playtime-guided Recommendation model designed to jointly optimize
accuracy and diversity. First, we introduce a playtime-guided interest
intensity exploration module that separates strong and weak preferences via
dual-beta modeling, enabling fine-grained user profiling and more accurate
recommendations. Second, we present a playtime-guided multimodal random walks
module that simulates player exploration using transitions guided by both
playtime-derived interest similarity and multimodal semantic similarity. This
mechanism preserves core preferences while promoting cross-category discovery
through latent semantic associations and adaptive category balancing. Extensive
experiments on a real-world game dataset show that DP2Rec outperforms existing
methods in both recommendation accuracy and diversity.

Motivation: 现代特定领域数据量大且复杂，gzip对特定格式文件因缺乏语法重复难以有效压缩，需新方法。

Method: 提出由GPT - 2构成的预处理器管道，将特定领域文件作为输入，输出适合gzip压缩的文件，再由gzip压缩。

Result: 使用真实和合成数据实验，国防日志压缩率提高0.34%，HTML文件提高5.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的GPT预处理器能提升特定领域文件在gzip下的压缩效果。

Abstract: In the modern era, large volumes of data are being produced continuously,
especially in domain-specific fields such as medical records and clinical
files, defence logs and HTML-based web traffic. Data with such volume and
complexity needs to be compressed before storing and transmitting efficiently.
Data compression has gained significant attention from modern researchers,
resulting in the development of fast and efficient compression algorithms such
as Gzip. However, since gzip works on the principle of repetition of binary
patterns, one of the limitations of gzip is that domain-specific formats like
JSON, XML, HTML, and log files, while structured, may have semantic repetition
but not syntactic repetition, which gzip finds difficult to compress. In this
article, we propose a GPT-based preprocessor for such domain-specific files. We
propose a pipeline made up of GPT-2 taking domain-specific files as input,
which pattern-based compressors like gzip find difficult to work on. The
preprocessor results are output in a file that is designed for compressors like
gzip. After preprocessing, the gzip works on the other end of the pipeline and
compresses the data as usual. We used different types of both real-world and
synthetically generated data, such as logs and HTML files, for the experiment
of the proposed model. We found promising results and an improvement of the
Defence logs by 0.34 per cent and HTML files by 5.8 per cent.

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体方法能显著增强复杂医学推理，为临床AI辅助提供方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their
ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic
evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from
Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three
complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration,
and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results
showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base
performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly
(52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited
effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent
framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive
functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis,
and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range
models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus
69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity
questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty
performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning
challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using
an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm
that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized
cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering
promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.

Abstract: In daily fantasy sports, players enter into "contests" where they compete
against each other by building teams of athletes that score fantasy points
based on what actually occurs in a real-life sports match. For any given sports
match, there are a multitude of contests available to players, with substantial
variation across 3 main dimensions: entry fee, number of spots, and the prize
pool distribution. As player preferences are also quite heterogeneous, contest
personalization is an important tool to match players with contests. This paper
presents a scalable contest recommendation system, powered by a Wide and Deep
Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) at its core. We productionized this system at our
company, one of the large fantasy sports platforms with millions of daily
contests and millions of players, where online experiments show a marked
improvement over other candidate models in terms of recall and other critical

Conclusion: 揭示了RAG在工业场景应用的现状、面临的挑战和行业关注点。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a well-established and rapidly
evolving field within AI that enhances the outputs of large language models by
integrating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources.
While industry adoption of RAG is now beginning, there is a significant lack of
research on its practical application in industrial contexts. To address this
gap, we conducted a semistructured interview study with 13 industry
practitioners to explore the current state of RAG adoption in real-world
settings. Our study investigates how companies apply RAG in practice, providing
(1) an overview of industry use cases, (2) a consolidated list of system
requirements, (3) key challenges and lessons learned from practical
experiences, and (4) an analysis of current industry evaluation methods. Our
main findings show that current RAG applications are mostly limited to
domain-specific QA tasks, with systems still in prototype stages; industry
requirements focus primarily on data protection, security, and quality, while
issues such as ethics, bias, and scalability receive less attention; data
preprocessing remains a key challenge, and system evaluation is predominantly
conducted by humans rather than automated methods.

Motivation: 传统排序系统的代理损失函数无法捕捉复杂用户行为偏差，导致模型与实际用户效用不一致。

Method: 先训练深度效用模型用日志数据估计用户对物品排列的参与度，再用可微软排列算子优化排序策略，还引入KD - Eval和LLM - Eval评估协议。

Result: 在大规模基准测试上，方法始终优于强基线。

Conclusion: 建模用户行为动态对效用优化排序有效。

Abstract: Traditional ranking systems rely on proxy loss functions that assume
simplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are
sorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are
influenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand
affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail
to capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with
actual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across
the ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling
user behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank,
first trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item
permutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize
predicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling
end-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To
address the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen
permutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\textit{KD-Eval}$,
using a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)
$\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language
models. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the
Amazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior
dynamics for utility-optimized ranking. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现有两阶段重排方法存在不一致问题，即通用搜索单元常遗漏高价值列表。

Method: 提出YOLOR，包含基于树的上下文提取模块（TCEM）以实现列表级有效性，上下文缓存模块（CCM）以实现排列级效率。

Result: 在公共和行业数据集上的大量实验验证了YOLOR的性能，且已成功部署到美团外卖平台。

Conclusion: YOLOR能有效解决现有重排方法的问题，兼具有效性和效率。

Abstract: Reranking plays a crucial role in modern recommender systems by capturing the
mutual influences within the list. Due to the inherent challenges of
combinatorial search spaces, most methods adopt a two-stage search paradigm: a
simple General Search Unit (GSU) efficiently reduces the candidate space, and
an Exact Search Unit (ESU) effectively selects the optimal sequence. These
methods essentially involve making trade-offs between effectiveness and
efficiency, while suffering from a severe \textbf{inconsistency problem}, that
is, the GSU often misses high-value lists from ESU. To address this problem, we
propose YOLOR, a one-stage reranking method that removes the GSU while
retaining only the ESU. Specifically, YOLOR includes: (1) a Tree-based Context
Extraction Module (TCEM) that hierarchically aggregates multi-scale contextual
features to achieve "list-level effectiveness", and (2) a Context Cache Module
(CCM) that enables efficient feature reuse across candidate permutations to
achieve "permutation-level efficiency". Extensive experiments across public and
industry datasets validate YOLOR's performance, and we have successfully
deployed YOLOR on the Meituan food delivery platform.

### [46] [Diverse Negative Sampling for Implicit Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14468)
*Yueqing Xuan,Kacper Sokol,Mark Sanderson,Jeffrey Chan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS) 用于隐式协同过滤推荐，可生成多样负样本，实验证明其有效且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有负采样策略会从密集区域过采样负样本，导致负数据同质化和模型表达能力受限。

Method: DivNS先找高偏好得分的难负样本并构建用户特定缓存，再从缓存中选多样负样本子集，最后合成更有效的训练数据。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明DivNS能提高推荐质量并保持计算效率。

Conclusion: DivNS生成的合成负样本既具信息性又有多样性，能让推荐器学习更广泛的物品空间，提高泛化能力。

Abstract: Implicit collaborative filtering recommenders are usually trained to learn
user positive preferences. Negative sampling, which selects informative
negative items to form negative training data, plays a crucial role in this
process. Since items are often clustered in the latent space, existing negative
sampling strategies normally oversample negative items from the dense regions.
This leads to homogeneous negative data and limited model expressiveness. In
this paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that
explicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative
sampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference
scores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly
informative negative samples. Then, its diversity-augmented sampler selects a
diverse subset of negative items from the cache while ensuring dissimilarity
from the user's hard negatives. Finally, a synthetic negatives generator
combines the selected diverse negatives with hard negatives to form more
effective training data. The resulting synthetic negatives are both informative
and diverse, enabling recommenders to learn a broader item space and improve
their generalisability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of DivNS in improving recommendation quality
while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ID-based推荐方法的数据稀疏问题，弥补现有多模态推荐方法忽略用户行为序列上下文影响的不足。

Method: 提出Distribution-Guided Multimodal-Interest Auto-Encoder (DMAE)模型，实现用户多模态兴趣在行为层面的跨融合。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了DMAE模型的优越性。

Conclusion: DMAE模型能有效解决现有推荐方法存在的问题，更好地捕捉用户多模态兴趣。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation methods rely on correlating the embedding vectors
of item IDs to capture implicit collaborative filtering signals to model the
user's interest in the target item. Consequently, traditional ID-based methods
often encounter data sparsity problems stemming from the sparse nature of ID
features. To alleviate the problem of item ID sparsity, recommendation models
incorporate multimodal item information to enhance recommendation accuracy.
However, existing multimodal recommendation methods typically employ early
fusion approaches, which focus primarily on combining text and image features,
while neglecting the contextual influence of user behavior sequences. This
oversight prevents dynamic adaptation of multimodal interest representations
based on behavioral patterns, consequently restricting the model's capacity to
effectively capture user multimodal interests. Therefore, this paper proposes
the Distribution-Guided Multimodal-Interest Auto-Encoder (DMAE), which achieves
the cross fusion of user multimodal interest at the behavioral
level.Ultimately, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DMAE.

Motivation: 现有电商多场景推荐方法用统一框架，共享底层表示阻碍捕捉场景独特性，且存在数据稀疏问题，需学习场景特定表示。

Method: 引入GSVR框架，用概率模型通过变分推理生成场景特定分布，用全局知识感知多项分布作为先验知识调节后验分布。

Result: 实验结果表明GSVR能帮助现有多场景推荐方法学习更稳健的表示。

Conclusion: GSVR框架有效，可应用于现有多场景推荐方法以提升性能。

Abstract: With the emergence of e-commerce, the recommendations provided by commercial
platforms must adapt to diverse scenarios to accommodate users' varying
shopping preferences. Current methods typically use a unified framework to
offer personalized recommendations for different scenarios. However, they often
employ shared bottom representations, which partially hinders the model's
capacity to capture scenario uniqueness. Ideally, users and items should
exhibit specific characteristics in different scenarios, prompting the need to
learn scenario-specific representations to differentiate scenarios. Yet,
variations in user and item interactions across scenarios lead to data sparsity
issues, impeding the acquisition of scenario-specific representations. To learn
robust scenario-specific representations, we introduce a Global-Distribution
Aware Scenario-Specific Variational Representation Learning Framework (GSVR)
that can be directly applied to existing multi-scenario methods. Specifically,
considering the uncertainty stemming from limited samples, our approach employs
a probabilistic model to generate scenario-specific distributions for each user
and item in each scenario, estimated through variational inference (VI).
Additionally, we introduce the global knowledge-aware multinomial distributions
as prior knowledge to regulate the learning of the posterior user and item
distributions, ensuring similarities among distributions for users with akin
interests and items with similar side information. This mitigates the risk of
users or items with fewer records being overwhelmed in sparse scenarios.
Extensive experimental results affirm the efficacy of GSVR in assisting
existing multi-scenario recommendation methods in learning more robust
representations.

Result: 大量离线实验和在线A/B测试验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的DGenCTR框架是有效的，适合CTR任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have inspired the field of recommender
systems to explore generative approaches, but most existing research focuses on
sequence generation, a paradigm ill-suited for click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. CTR models critically depend on a large number of cross-features
between the target item and the user to estimate the probability of clicking on
the item, and discarding these cross-features will significantly impair model
performance. Therefore, to harness the ability of generative models to
understand data distributions and thereby alleviate the constraints of
traditional discriminative models in label-scarce space, diverging from the
item-generation paradigm of sequence generation methods, we propose a novel
sample-level generation paradigm specifically designed for the CTR task: a
two-stage Discrete Diffusion-Based Generative CTR training framework (DGenCTR).
This two-stage framework comprises a diffusion-based generative pre-training
stage and a CTR-targeted supervised fine-tuning stage for CTR. Finally,
extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing conclusively validate the
effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出MISS方法，包含多模态索引树和多模态终身序列建模模块，还提出多模态索引树、Co - GSU和MM - GSU。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Large-scale industrial recommendation systems typically employ a two-stage
paradigm of retrieval and ranking to handle huge amounts of information. Recent
research focuses on improving the performance of retrieval model. A promising
way is to introduce extensive information about users and items. On one hand,
lifelong sequential behavior is valuable. Existing lifelong behavior modeling
methods in ranking stage focus on the interaction of lifelong behavior and
candidate items from retrieval stage. In retrieval stage, it is difficult to
utilize lifelong behavior because of a large corpus of candidate items. On the
other hand, existing retrieval methods mostly relay on interaction information,
potentially disregarding valuable multi-modal information. To solve these
problems, we represent the pioneering exploration of leveraging multi-modal
information and lifelong sequence model within the advanced tree-based
retrieval model. We propose Multi-modal Indexing and Searching with lifelong
Sequence (MISS), which contains a multi-modal index tree and a multi-modal
lifelong sequence modeling module. Specifically, for better index structure, we
propose multi-modal index tree, which is built using the multi-modal embedding
to precisely represent item similarity. To precisely capture diverse user
interests in user lifelong sequence, we propose collaborative general search
unit (Co-GSU) and multi-modal general search unit (MM-GSU) for
multi-perspective interests searching.

Motivation: 本地生活服务视频推荐需兼顾用户兴趣和实时位置，现有端到端生成式推荐模型未应用于此场景，存在利用地理信息和平衡多目标的挑战。

Method: 提出OneLoc模型，从不同角度利用地理信息，用强化学习和两个奖励函数平衡多目标。

Result: OneLoc取得出色的离线和在线性能，在快手本地生活服务部署后，日服务4亿活跃用户，商品交易总额和订单数分别提升21.016%和17.891%。

Conclusion: OneLoc模型有效解决了本地生活服务视频推荐的挑战，能提升业务指标。

Abstract: Local life service is a vital scenario in Kuaishou App, where video
recommendation is intrinsically linked with store's location information. Thus,
recommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into
account user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of
such complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a
new paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search
scenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service,
an end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as
there are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make
full use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance
multiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and
stores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we
propose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different
perspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic
information for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder
leverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3)
neighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for
generation. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and
propose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the
above design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In
fact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves
400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in
terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers.

Motivation: 传统序贯学习模型多关注正交互，忽略负反馈对提升用户满意度的作用，且负反馈有助于识别用户真实兴趣。

Method: 训练两个Transformer编码器处理正负交互序列，用包含正负交叉熵和对比项的复合损失函数训练序贯推荐器。

Result: 与现有序贯推荐方法相比，该方法提高了真阳性指标，减少了错误推荐的负反馈物品数量。

Conclusion: 提出的结合正负反馈的序贯推荐方法有效。

Abstract: We consider the task of learning from both positive and negative feedback in
a sequential recommendation scenario, as both types of feedback are often
present in user interactions. Meanwhile, conventional sequential learning
models usually focus on considering and predicting positive interactions,
ignoring that reducing items with negative feedback in recommendations improves
user satisfaction with the service. Moreover, the negative feedback can
potentially provide a useful signal for more accurate identification of true
user interests. In this work, we propose to train two transformer encoders on
separate positive and negative interaction sequences. We incorporate both types
of feedback into the training objective of the sequential recommender using a
composite loss function that includes positive and negative cross-entropy as
well as a cleverly crafted contrastive term, that helps better modeling
opposing patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in terms
of increasing true-positive metrics compared to state-of-the-art sequential
recommendation methods while reducing the number of wrongly promoted negative
items.

Method: 使用聚类技术将表格学生数据转换为图结构，比较GNN（自定义GCN和GraphSAGE）与表格模型（RF、XGBoost和TabNet）在真实学生数据集上的性能，探索不同图构建策略。

Result: 基于PCA - KMeans聚类的GraphSAGE配置表现优越，宏观F1分数提高约7个百分点，准确率提高近2个百分点。其他GNN配置和图构建方法未持续超越表格模型。

Conclusion: GNN有潜力，但在该领域将表格数据转换为图数据用于学习存在挑战，图生成策略和GNN架构选择至关重要。

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the
reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific
traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research
uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in
varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution
analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to
their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics
and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this
comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability
in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be
guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel
trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future
inland waterways navigation.

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

Conclusion: STAS框架有效解决了SNN-based ViTs应用ACT的问题，实现能耗降低和准确率提升

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements
across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants,
including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time
Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000
customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the
observed improvements.

cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and
considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been established as an effective method for
detecting Parkinson's disease, typically diagnosed early.Current Parkinson's
disease detection methods have shown significant success within individual
datasets, however, the variability in detection methods across different EEG
datasets and the small size of each dataset pose challenges for training a
generalizable model for cross-dataset scenarios. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for
EEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design
a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the
distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an
EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of
generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a
combination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture
the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a
generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to
utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation
results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art
models in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an
F1-score of 84.0%, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed model.

Conclusion: ABMLL是解决大语言模型微调泛化问题的有效方法，在性能上更具优势。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

Conclusion: 深化了对SGGMs的理论理解，证明其在关键领域的适用性，为设计有效模型提供实践指导。

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical
applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their
theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains
underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型难以捕捉用户特定细微偏好，尤其在数据有限和跨领域场景下，需新方法解决。

Method: 引入PersRM - R1框架，结合合成数据生成和两阶段训练（监督微调+强化微调）。

Result: PersRM - R1在准确性和泛化性上超越同规模模型，与更大模型性能相当。

Conclusion: PersRM - R1为更有效的个性化大语言模型发展提供方向。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

Motivation: 相似性选择情境下IIA检验因选择的目标依赖性而复杂，相关研究少，故提出方法检验IIA。

Method: 提出经典拟合优度检验和基于后验预测检查（PPC）框架的贝叶斯检验方法，构建两个数据集，设计新的PPC群体同质性检验。

Result: 两个数据集均有显著IIA违背，违背程度相当，群体是同质的。

Conclusion: 需要新的相似性选择模型来考虑情境效应。

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck.
Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels
for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the
model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of
the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted
as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple
implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show
that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors
that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no
additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

Conclusion: 结合领域知识和先进ML技术可提高油气产量预测的可靠性。

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the
reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

Conclusion: 分析既证实又挑战了先前设计假设，指明了有前景的研究方向并提供实践指导。

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given
textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models,
traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

Conclusion: 框架能识别有物理意义的SGS形式并校准系数，为现有湍流建模方法提供补充。

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for
discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale
closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations
through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical
parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter
enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;
memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and
ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model
identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate

Conclusion: FedEve方法能有效缓解周期漂移和客户端漂移对跨设备联邦学习的影响。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

Conclusion: EEGDM为当前基础模型提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the
brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning
meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Conclusion: 所提统一框架能有效提升含动态拓扑的分布式SGD算法性能。

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single
linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

Conclusion: EdgeFD提高了联邦蒸馏的可扩展性和实际适用性，代码开源可复现。

Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine
learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced
communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model
outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing
methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

Motivation: 传统异常检测方法主要关注个体移动模式，集体异常检测需建模个体间时空依赖，是未充分探索的挑战。

Method: 将问题表述为基于共现事件图的集体事件序列无监督学习，采用两阶段注意力机制，通过掩码事件和链接重建任务预训练。

Result: CoBAD能检测两种集体异常，在大规模移动数据集上显著优于现有基线，AUCROC提升13%-18%，AUCPR提升19%-70%。

Conclusion: CoBAD是一种有效的人类移动集体异常检测模型，源代码公开。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies
and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior
work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that
CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving
an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR. All source code is

Result: 在链接预测基准测试中，单调GNN和评分函数表现良好，能产生许多合理规则。

Conclusion: 所采用的结合单调GNN和评分函数的方法在链接预测任务中有效且可解释。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

Result: 实验结果显示这些技术能在强化学习训练阶段加速奖励获取。

Conclusion: 在有限和连续物理环境实验中证明了pRMs的表现力和有效性，融入pRMs能显著提升多个控制任务的学习效率。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

Result: 用最难样本训练性能提升最大可达47%，用简单样本提升最小，原因是难样本在GRPO训练中有更多可学习机会。

Conclusion: 预算受限的后训练中，GRPO使用难样本在推理任务上有显著性能提升。

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

Conclusion: IHNN在超图学习中建立了新的最优水平。

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.

Conclusion: ERIS框架能实现有引导且可靠的特征解纠缠，提升模型在OOD数据上的性能。

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: 所提方法具有鲁棒性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出利用元学习框架缓解估计宏观基本图（MFD）时的数据稀缺问题，经测试表现良好且有可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 估计给定网络的MFD需要大量环形检测器，实际中难以满足，存在数据稀缺挑战。

Method: 提出元学习框架，应用于多任务物理信息神经网络来估计MFD，利用多城市数据训练和测试模型。

Result: 流量预测的均方误差平均改善范围在~17500到36000之间，能在不同城市环境中泛化，提升数据有限城市的性能。

Conclusion: 在检测器数量有限时，元学习框架有应用潜力，且具有可迁移性。

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

Conclusion: 将生物观察到的功能连接模式作为结构偏差应用于ANN设计是可行的，能在减少计算量的同时提升性能。

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and
sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost,
functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer
computations.

Motivation: 解决智能不是遍历性的问题，解决现代AI的计算瓶颈，构建统一、基于生物学的智能理论。

Method: 引入MAI框架，将认知建模为对记忆中潜在循环的推理，通过结构重用来编码归纳偏差；借助delta - homology建模，建立MAI与强化学习的时间反转对偶性。

Result: MAI为Mountcastle的通用皮质算法提供了理论基础，建立了与强化学习的对偶关系，为节能推理开辟了道路。

Conclusion: MAI是基于结构、重用和记忆的统一、基于生物学的智能理论，对实现AGI有深远意义。

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on
structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications
of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Result: 在真实图像分类任务中，GraphCBMs在分类任务表现优越、能利用潜在概念图进行更有效干预、在不同训练和架构设置下性能稳健。

Conclusion: GraphCBMs能在提升模型性能的同时保留可解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust
in performance across different training and architecture settings.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on
statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation
scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local
neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two
training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary
predictors or adding any inference overhead.

Method: 结合对抗逆强化学习（AIRL）和组相对策略优化（GRPO），直接从正确推理轨迹学习密集、动态的过程奖励模型（PRM）。

Result: 在八个基准测试中平均性能比基础模型提高9%，匹配GPT - 4o；集成到多种搜索算法中，PRM优于所有用标签数据训练的基线PRM。

Conclusion: RL的奖励函数是搜索的最佳PRM，为大语言模型复杂推理任务提供了稳健且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and
tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces
FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with
periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance
climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble
(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under
different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent
baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited
for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a
scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for
physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a
changing climate. Code accessible at

Conclusion: GCTD能有效减小图大小并保持GNN性能，是解决图凝聚问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various
real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social
media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to
their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

Conclusion: NeRC框架有效提升了城市环境下移动设备GNSS定位精度，且具有实时处理能力。

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

Abstract: Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However,
existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow

have demonstrated promise in other domains, they have not yet been applied to
ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the
simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results
demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training
efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed,
highlighting its potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity.

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

Motivation: 现有事件响应决策支持框架依赖详细系统模型，实用性受限，需解决此局限。

Method: 提出MOBAL方法，通过贝叶斯学习迭代完善模型猜想，将猜想模型量化为有限马尔可夫模型进行动态规划。

Result: 证明贝叶斯学习与信息反馈渐近一致，确定误设和量化误差界限，CAGE - 2基准实验显示MOBAL表现更优。

Conclusion: MOBAL能有效应对模型误设，在事件响应规划中具有更好的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and
robustness to model misspecification.

Motivation: 挑战扩散模型需大量隐状态或时间步训练使反向生成过程接近高斯分布这一基本假设。

Method: 精心选择噪声调度以小隐状态数训练模型，将隐状态数极限推至单隐状态，结合独立训练的单隐状态模型得到解纠缠模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的解纠缠模型在训练效率上有显著提升。

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides
a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on
individual responses to lifestyle changes.

Result: 在多种任务中取得显著提升，如翻译质量、数学推理准确率等。

Conclusion: DuPO是可扩展、通用且无需标注的大语言模型优化范式。

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

Conclusion: 改进后的基准测试方法能有效提高符号回归算法的重发现率并减少计算开销。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and
TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of
SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%.
Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's
rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

Result: 在三个医学数据集上评估，反事实基线比标准基线选择产生更忠实和医学相关的归因。

Conclusion: 反事实引导方法能解决传统基线的局限性，在医学数据路径归因中表现更好。

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，语义能量显著提高了幻觉检测和不确定性估计的效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

Motivation: 精确计算Shapley值复杂度高，概率模型下计算更难，限制了其应用。

Method: 为局部解释定义随机合作博弈，为全局解释引入确定性、基于方差的值函数，利用FANOVA分解的闭式表示和递归算法计算Shapley值的均值和方差。

Result: 能在二次时间内计算FANOVA GP模型局部和全局解释的精确Shapley值。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构化概率模型预测提供更具可扩展性、公理合理且考虑不确定性的解释，增强了可解释AI的实用性。

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂云环境中有卓越能力。

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds
state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling
experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

Conclusion: 验证了在深度强化学习中使用正交多项式基的潜力，同时强调了模型复杂度的权衡。

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the
ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

Result: 证明A_min达到对数竞争比，数值模拟显示A_min表现接近后见调度器。

Conclusion: A_min在实际场景中高效且鲁棒，仅依赖预测区间下限是有利设计。

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

TL;DR: 传统非侵入式负荷监测（NILM）方法在电表后能源源增加时性能下降，提出DualNILM框架，实验显示其性能远超传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电表后能源源（如太阳能板和电池存储）的增加，使依赖电表数据的传统NILM方法性能下降，需新方法应对。

Method: 提出DualNILM，基于Transformer架构集成序列到点和序列到序列策略，以捕捉多尺度时间依赖。

Result: 使用自收集和合成的开放NILM数据集验证，DualNILM在两项任务上表现出色，远超传统方法。

Conclusion: DualNILM框架能有效解决电表后能源源带来的挑战，提升NILM性能。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对影响CDO性能因素的系统研究，且相关方法缺乏航空领域所需的透明度。

Method: 提出FEXAI框架，整合了模糊逻辑、机器学习和SHAP分析，收集航班数据，应用机器学习模型和SHAP分类并排序特征，构建模糊规则分类器。

Result: 所有模型分类准确率超90%，FEXAI提供可解释规则，确定平均下降率、下降段数量和方向变化为CDO性能强预测因素。

Conclusion: FEXAI方法为运营决策支持提供新途径，可集成到航空工具实现实时建议。

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临床预测模型忽略临床概念语义关系，本研究旨在通过整合特定领域语义信息来改进肺癌发病预测。

Method: 从Optum EHR数据集构建临床知识图谱，用黎曼随机梯度下降生成庞加莱嵌入，将其融入ResNet和Transformer模型，并评估模型的区分度和校准性能。

Result: 与使用随机初始化欧几里得嵌入的基线模型相比，预训练庞加莱嵌入使区分性能有适度且一致的提升；ResNet模型（尤其是10维庞加莱嵌入）校准能力增强，Transformer模型校准稳定。

Conclusion: 将临床知识图谱嵌入双曲空间并融入深度学习模型可通过保留临床术语层次结构来改善肺癌发病预测，是结合数据驱动特征提取与临床知识的可行方法。

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

Conclusion: Diff - In是一种有效、可扩展的样本影响近似方法，能解决现有数据分析工具的精度问题。

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

Result: ELATE在不同领域平均提高预测准确性8.4%。

Conclusion: ELATE能有效提升时间序列预测的准确性，可用于自动化特征工程。

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine
learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed
to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often
manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive
enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific
insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated
Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an
evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

Motivation: GNN在预测中存在基于种族和性别等属性的偏差，且图结构和消息传递机制会加剧偏差，现有减轻偏差方法可能消除非敏感特征，破坏预测准确性和公平性的平衡。

Method: 提出Fair - ICD方法，利用反事实数据增强，在消息传递前用反事实创建多样邻域，促进从增强图中学习无偏节点表示，再用对抗判别器减少传统GNN分类器预测中的偏差。

Result: 在标准数据集上用三种GNN骨干网络进行实验，Fair - ICD显著提升了公平性指标，同时保持了高预测性能。

Conclusion: Fair - ICD方法能在适度条件下确保GNN的公平性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于因果边分离的谱神经网络CES2 - GAD能有效解决异质图上的异常检测问题。

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

Conclusion: 为未来研究提供可操作的见解，代码开源。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can
be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

Conclusion: HERAKLES框架能有效应对开放环境下目标复杂度增长问题，提升智能体性能。

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent
peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

Conclusion: “上下文引导”方法实现从发现固有数据结构到主动塑造特定目标特征空间的转变。

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

Conclusion: 基于损失的数据增强和向量化蒸馏对高效有效的模型压缩很有前景。

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models
to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained
environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and
effective model compression.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex
and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to
the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

TL;DR: 提出Source - Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) 框架，理论证明能精确恢复目标分布，给出误差界，实验验证有效性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进生成模型的引导方式，避免修改概率流向量场，提供更灵活的引导方法。

Method: 提出SGFM框架，直接修改源分布，保持预训练向量场不变，将引导问题转化为源分布的采样问题。

Result: 理论上SGFM能精确恢复目标分布，给出近似采样时的Wasserstein误差界，实验表明在2D基准、图像数据集和物理信息生成任务中有效。

Conclusion: SGFM框架有效且灵活，允许用户根据具体问题选择采样方法，与最优流匹配模型集成良好。

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

Method: 对链接预测的对比学习进行理论分析，提出图增强方法EBA，将其与新对比损失结合得到CoEBA。

Result: 在8个基准数据集上实验，CoEBA显著优于其他先进的链接预测模型。

Conclusion: 提出的CoEBA能有效提升链接预测模型的性能。

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续减半算法依赖中间性能值做资源分配决策，可能过早淘汰后期表现好的候选者，需克服此局限。

Method: 在大规模实证研究中，对比基于学习曲线预测的方法和基于当前性能值的标准方法。

Result: 预测方法有竞争力，但因需要完全观察到的学习曲线作训练数据，相比增加标准方法资源投入并非帕累托最优。

Conclusion: 预测方法虽有不足，但可通过利用现有学习曲线数据缓解其缺点。

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

Result: AME产生的平均神经网络解决方案在分布外设置中优于个体专家模型和模型汤基线。

Conclusion: 提出了无数据模型权重聚合的原则性和可推广概念，定义了一种神经网络平均的方法。

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

graph structures, and 2D molecular image representations. Quantum Vision
Transformer (QVT) backbone equipped with modality-specific encoders and a
unified cross-attention fusion module. By integrating graph features and
spatial patterns, our method captures key stereoelectronic interactions behind

achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.1%, outperforming sequence-only baselines by a
substantial margin and achieving better performance results compared to other
QML models.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效对大语言模型进行越狱攻击，提高了攻击效果。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

Conclusion: GTGIB框架能有效解决时态图学习中归纳表示学习的问题，具有较好性能。

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型注入各向同性高斯噪声，忽略数据结构，受量子压缩态启发，期望通过数据依赖的噪声缩放帮助模型学习重要特征。

Method: 引入SDM，沿训练分布主成分各向异性缩放噪声，研究两种配置：海森堡扩散模型和标准SDM变体。

Result: 在CIFAR - 10/100和CelebA - 64上，适度反挤压使FID最多提升15%，提升召回率。

Conclusion: 简单的数据感知噪声整形无需架构更改就能带来稳健的生成增益。

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

Conclusion: 研究结果为深度强化学习的计算最优扩展提供基础起点，借鉴监督学习研究并适配TD学习。

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.

Motivation: 直接训练SNN计算和能耗高，现有ANN - SNN转换方法难实现超低延迟且易有信息损失、性能下降问题。

Method: 从信息熵角度分析量化层信息损失，提出Polarity Multi - Spike Mapping (PMSM)和量化层超参数调整策略。

Result: 在ViT - S架构单时间步下，CIFAR - 10、CIFAR - 100和ImageNet达到先进准确率；在VGG - 16下，相比基线方法能耗降低超5倍。

Conclusion: 所提方法实现近无损ANN - SNN转换，为高效转换建立新基准。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer advantages in computational efficiency
via event-driven computing, compared to traditional artificial neural networks
(ANNs). While direct training methods tackle the challenge of
non-differentiable activation mechanisms in SNNs, they often suffer from high
computational and energy costs during training. As a result, ANN-to-SNN
conversion approach still remains a valuable and practical alternative. These
conversion-based methods aim to leverage the discrete output produced by the
quantization layer to obtain SNNs with low latency. Although the theoretical
minimum latency is one timestep, existing conversion methods have struggled to
realize such ultra-low latency without accuracy loss. Moreover, current
quantization approaches often discard negative-value information following
batch normalization and are highly sensitive to the hyperparameter
configuration, leading to degraded performance. In this work, we, for the first
time, analyze the information loss introduced by quantization layers through
the lens of information entropy. Building on our analysis, we introduce
Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping (PMSM) and a hyperparameter adjustment strategy
tailored for the quantization layer. Our method achieves nearly lossless
ANN-to-SNN conversion at the extremity, i.e., the first timestep, while also
leveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs across multiple timesteps to maintain
stable performance on complex tasks. Experimental results show that our PMSM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.5% on CIFAR-10, 89.3% on CIFAR-100
and 81.6% on ImageNet with only one timestep on ViT-S architecture,
establishing a new benchmark for efficient conversion. In addition, our method
reduces energy consumption by over 5x under VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
compared to the baseline method.

<details>

Motivation: 当前基准在评估大语言模型生成的生产级软件时存在不足，无法捕捉交互行为和运行时动态。

Method: 引入 RealDevWorld 框架，包含 RealDevBench 任务集和 AppEvalPilot 评估系统，可模拟用户交互进行评估。

Result: RealDevWorld 评估准确，准确率达 0.92，与专家评估相关性为 0.85，减少人工审查。

Conclusion: RealDevWorld 可对大语言模型生成的生产级软件进行可扩展、与人一致的评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and code agents in software development are
rapidly evolving from generating isolated code snippets to producing
full-fledged software applications with graphical interfaces, interactive
logic, and dynamic behaviors. However, current benchmarks fall short in
evaluating such production-ready software, as they often rely on static checks
or binary pass/fail scripts, failing to capture the interactive behaviors and
runtime dynamics that define real-world usability - qualities that only emerge
when an application is actively used. This is the blind spot of current
evaluation: you don't know if an app works until you click through it, interact
with it, and observe how it responds. To bridge this gap, we introduce
RealDevWorld, a novel evaluation framework for automated end-to-end assessment
of LLMs' ability to generate production-ready repositories from scratch. It
features two key components: (1) RealDevBench, a diverse collection of 194
open-ended software engineering tasks across multiple domains, incorporating
multimodal elements to reflect real-world complexity; and (2) AppEvalPilot, a
new agent-as-a-judge evaluation system that simulates realistic, GUI-based user
interactions to automatically and holistically assess software functional
correctness, visual fidelity, and runtime behavior. The framework delivers
fine-grained, task-specific diagnostic feedback, supporting nuanced evaluation
beyond simple success/failure judgments. Empirical results show that
RealDevWorld delivers effective, automatic, and human-aligned evaluations,
achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a correlation of 0.85 with expert human
assessments, while significantly reducing the reliance on manual review. This
enables scalable, human-aligned assessment of production-level software
generated by LLMs. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Specifications for code writing tasks are usually expressed in natural

to recognize ambiguities in task specifications and resolve them by asking
clarifying questions. We present and evaluate a prototype system, based on a
novel technique (ARHF: Ambiguity Resolution with Human Feedback), that (1)
suggests specific inputs on which a given task specification may be ambiguous,
(2) seeks limited human feedback about the code's desired behavior on those
inputs, and (3) uses this feedback to generate code that resolves these
ambiguities. We evaluate the efficacy of our prototype, and we discuss the
implications of such assistive systems on Computer Science education.

Conclusion: 该方法时间复杂度为O(n,d)，无需外部测试，是代码生成评估工具包的轻量级补充。

Abstract: Assessing the stability of code generation from large language models (LLMs)
is essential for judging their reliability in real-world development. We extend
prior "structural-entropy concepts" to the program domain by pairing entropy
with abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis. For any fixed prompt, we collect the
multiset of depth-bounded subtrees of AST in each generated program and treat
their relative frequencies as a probability distribution. We then measure
stability in two complementary ways: (i) Jensen-Shannon divergence, a
symmetric, bounded indicator of structural overlap, and (ii) a Structural
Cross-Entropy ratio that highlights missing high-probability patterns. Both
metrics admit structural-only and token-aware variants, enabling separate views
on control-flow shape and identifier-level variability. Unlike pass@k, BLEU, or
CodeBLEU, our metrics are reference-free, language-agnostic, and
execution-independent. We benchmark several leading LLMs on standard code
generation tasks, demonstrating that AST-driven structural entropy reveals
nuances in model consistency and robustness. The method runs in O(n,d) time
with no external tests, providing a lightweight addition to the code-generation
evaluation toolkit.

Motivation: 现有基准主要评估代码功能正确性，忽略代码质量多维度，需评估大语言模型生成多维度高质量代码能力。

Method: 使用PythonSecurityEval基准评估，引入迭代静态分析驱动提示算法，利用Bandit和Pylint识别并解决代码质量问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation, achieving high scores on benchmarks such as HumanEval and

neglect broader dimensions of code quality, including security, reliability,
readability, and maintainability. In this work, we systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate high-quality code across multiple dimensions using
the PythonSecurityEval benchmark. We introduce an iterative static
analysis-driven prompting algorithm that leverages Bandit and Pylint to
identify and resolve code quality issues. Our experiments with GPT-4o show
substantial improvements: security issues reduced from >40% to 13%, readability
violations from >80% to 11%, and reliability warnings from >50% to 11% within
ten iterations. These results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by static
analysis feedback, can significantly enhance code quality beyond functional
correctness.

Motivation: 低成本环境传感器和AI应用增加，促使对可扩展和有弹性的数据基础设施需求增长，尤其是在数据稀缺和资源受限地区。

Method: 使用开源技术（如Apache Airflow、Apache Kafka和Google BigQuery）构建模块化、云原生ETL系统，整合不同数据源。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of low-cost environmental sensors and AI-enabled
applications has accelerated the demand for scalable and resilient data
infrastructures, particularly in data-scarce and resource-constrained regions.
This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the AirQo
data pipeline: a modular, cloud-native Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) system
engineered to support both real-time and batch processing of heterogeneous air
quality data across urban deployments in Africa. It is Built using open-source
technologies such as Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka, and Google BigQuery. The
pipeline integrates diverse data streams from low-cost sensors, third-party
weather APIs, and reference-grade monitors to enable automated calibration,
forecasting, and accessible analytics. We demonstrate the pipeline's ability to
ingest, transform, and distribute millions of air quality measurements monthly
from over 400 monitoring devices while achieving low latency, high throughput,
and robust data availability, even under constrained power and connectivity
conditions. The paper details key architectural features, including workflow
orchestration, decoupled ingestion layers, machine learning-driven sensor
calibration, and observability frameworks. Performance is evaluated across
operational metrics such as resource utilization, ingestion throughput,
calibration accuracy, and data availability, offering practical insights into
building sustainable environmental data platforms. By open-sourcing the
platform and documenting deployment experiences, this work contributes a
reusable blueprint for similar initiatives seeking to advance environmental
intelligence through data engineering in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 当前LLM编码器带来机遇与局限，需重新评估软件结构，提出新结构模式并通过案例研究评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM编码器带来的机遇和局限要求重新评估软件结构，解决现有软件难读、模块化不足的问题。

Method: 提出包含概念和同步的新结构模式，使用特定领域语言表达行为特征，通过RealWorld基准案例研究评估。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未明确提及具体结论，但暗示新结构模式可改善软件的易读性和模块化。

Abstract: The opportunities offered by LLM coders (and their current limitations)
demand a reevaluation of how software is structured. Software today is often
"illegible" - lacking a direct correspondence between code and observed
behavior - and insufficiently modular, leading to a failure of three key
requirements of robust coding: incrementality (the ability to deliver small
increments by making localized changes), integrity (avoiding breaking prior
increments) and transparency (making clear what has changed at build time, and
what actions have happened at runtime).
  A new structural pattern offers improved legibility and modularity. Its
elements are concepts and synchronizations: fully independent services and
event-based rules that mediate between them. A domain-specific language for
synchronizations allows behavioral features to be expressed in a granular and
declarative way (and thus readily generated by an LLM). A case study of the
RealWorld benchmark is used to illustrate and evaluate the approach.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在形式化验证中因上下文长度限制和难以推断复杂过程间规范而扩展性差，需更好方法实现大规模软硬件系统的全自动验证。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: Preguss为大规模程序的自动验证开辟了一条有吸引力的道路。

Abstract: Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is
arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have
recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in
formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to
deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to context-length
limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex,
interprocedural specifications. This paper outlines Preguss - a modular,
fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal
specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive
verification by orchestrating two components: (i) potential runtime error
(RTE)-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii)
LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We
envisage that Preguss paves a compelling path towards the automated
verification of large-scale programs.

Result: 给出一个基于组件的Java系统的演示器，该演示器为开源Web应用，用户可免费访问。

Conclusion: 此方法语言无关，生成的解释能帮助开发者理解系统，即便不熟悉系统细节。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of manual debugging, which nowadays
remains resource-intensive and in some parts archaic. This problem is
especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems.
Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can
possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease
this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in
conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations.
These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface
information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to
understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes.
Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based
Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated
explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if
developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our
demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely
accessible to all users.

TL;DR: 研究代码格式化对大语言模型性能和效率的影响，发现去除格式可减输入令牌，提示和微调可减输出代码长度，还开发转换工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码格式化元素对大语言模型无益且增加计算成本和响应时间，需明确其作用以优化成本。

Method: 在四种编程语言和十个大语言模型的填空代码完成任务上进行大规模实验，分析去除格式元素时的令牌数量和性能。

Result: 大语言模型在有格式和无格式代码上性能相当，平均输入令牌减少24.5%，输出令牌减少可忽略；提示和微调可使输出代码长度最多减少36.1%且不影响正确性。

Conclusion: 去除代码格式是提高大语言模型效率的实用策略，开发的转换工具可兼顾人类可读性和模型效率。

Abstract: Source code is usually formatted with elements like indentation and newlines
to improve readability for human developers. However, these visual aids do not
seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since
the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these
additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response
times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can
reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played
by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate
the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through
large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four
programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\#) and ten LLMs-including both
commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and
performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that
LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code,
achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\% with negligible output
token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization
strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both
prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to
36.1\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate
practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for
format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM
inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.

Result: 大语言模型生成的解释质量高，在用户评分中大多优于模板方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能利用RDF和SPARQL作为解释上下文，自动向人类解释问答组件的行为和决策。

Abstract: Over time, software systems have reached a level of complexity that makes it
difficult for their developers and users to explain particular decisions made
by them. In this paper, we focus on the explainability of component-based
systems for Question Answering (QA). These components often conduct processes
driven by AI methods, in which behavior and decisions cannot be clearly
explained or justified, s.t., even for QA experts interpreting the executed
process and its results is hard. To address this challenge, we present an
approach that considers the components' input and output data flows as a source
for representing the behavior and provide explanations for the components,
enabling users to comprehend what happened. In the QA framework used here, the
data flows of the components are represented as SPARQL queries (inputs) and RDF
triples (outputs). Hence, we are also providing valuable insights on
verbalization regarding these data types. In our experiments, the approach
generates explanations while following template-based settings (baseline) or
via the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different configurations
(automatic generation). Our evaluation shows that the explanations generated
via LLMs achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches
according to the users' ratings. Therefore, it enables us to automatically
explain the behavior and decisions of QA components to humans while using RDF
and SPARQL as a context for explanations.

Motivation: 机器学习推动多模态系统发展，缺乏适配多模态交互的语言和方法来定义相关需求，存在系统无法满足用户需求的风险。

Method: 提出MERLAN领域特定语言，给出其元模型，用ANTLR语法实现文本语法，开发原型工具。

Result: 开发出能让需求工程师编写需求并基于代理框架自动生成符合需求的系统实现的原型工具。

Conclusion: MERLAN可用于指定多模态接口的需求。

Abstract: Multimodal systems, which process multiple input types such as text, audio,
and images, are becoming increasingly prevalent in software systems, enabled by
the huge advancements in Machine Learning. This triggers the need to easily
define the requirements linked to these new types of user interactions,
potentially involving more than one modality at the same time. This remains an
open challenge due to the lack of languages and methods adapted to the diverse
nature of multimodal interactions, with the risk of implementing AI-enhanced
systems that do not properly satisfy the user needs.
  In this sense, this paper presents MERLAN, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
to specify the requirements for these new types of multimodal interfaces. We
present the metamodel for such language together with a textual syntax
implemented as an ANTLR grammar. A prototype tool enabling requirements
engineers to write such requirements and automatically generate a possible
implementation of a system compliant with them on top of an agentic framework
is also provided.

Motivation: 以往研究多评估大语言模型生成代码的功能性能，此研究旨在评估代码质量和安全性。

Method: 通过SonarQube对4442个Java编码作业的大语言模型输出进行全面静态分析。

Result: 大语言模型虽能生成功能代码，但存在软件缺陷，功能性能与代码质量和安全性无直接关联。

Conclusion: 大语言模型生成的代码需验证才能用于生产，静态分析可检测潜在缺陷，对部署AI进行软件开发的组织是重要保障。

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the code quality and
security of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): Claude Sonnet 4,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, and OpenCoder 8B. While prior
research has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this
research tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through
comprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that
although LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of
software defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
These defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared
weaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code
generation methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded
passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple
models. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in
order to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation
between a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit
tests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by
the number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the
functional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is
not a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this
study is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models
appear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the
view that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent
defects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software
development.

Abstract: Verification and validation of vehicles is a complex yet critical process,
particularly for ensuring safety and coverage through simulations. However,
achieving realistic and useful simulations comes with significant challenges.
To explore these challenges, we conducted a workshop with experts in the field,
allowing them to brainstorm key obstacles. Following this, we distributed a
survey to consolidate findings and gain further insights into potential
solutions. The experts identified 17 key challenges, along with proposed
solutions, an assessment of whether they represent next steps for research, and
the roadblocks to their implementation. While a lack of resources was not
initially highlighted as a major challenge, utilizing more resources emerged as
a critical necessity when experts discussed solutions. Interestingly, we
expected some of these challenges to have already been addressed or to have
systematic solutions readily available, given the collective expertise in the
field. Many of the identified problems already have known solutions, allowing
us to shift focus towards unresolved challenges and share the next steps with
the broader community.

Motivation: 特征选择和重要性估计在与模型无关的情况下是持续挑战，包装法虽常用但计算量大，需对GCM和LOCO相关特征选择方法进行对比。

Method: 在三种模型设置（线性、非线性加性、单层神经网络模拟的单指标模型）下进行理论比较，辅以大量模拟和真实数据示例，涉及神经网络和梯度提升树等机器学习方法。

Result: 理论结果和实证发现表明，在合适正则条件下，GCM相关方法通常优于LOCO，并量化了这些方法的渐近相对效率。

Conclusion: GCM相关方法在合适条件下在特征选择上比LOCO更有优势。

Abstract: Feature selection and importance estimation in a model-agnostic setting is an
ongoing challenge of significant interest. Wrapper methods are commonly used
because they are typically model-agnostic, even though they are computationally
intensive. In this paper, we focus on feature selection methods related to the
Generalized Covariance Measure (GCM) and Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO)
estimation, and provide a comparison based on relative efficiency. In
particular, we present a theoretical comparison under three model settings:
linear models, non-linear additive models, and single index models that mimic a
single-layer neural network. We complement this with extensive simulations and
real data examples. Our theoretical results, along with empirical findings,
demonstrate that GCM-related methods generally outperform LOCO under suitable
regularity conditions. Furthermore, we quantify the asymptotic relative
efficiency of these approaches. Our simulations and real data analysis include
widely used machine learning methods such as neural networks and gradient
boosting trees.

Abstract: Quantifying out-of-sample discrimination performance for time-to-event
outcomes is a fundamental step for model evaluation and selection in the
context of predictive modelling. The concordance index, or C-index, is a widely
used metric for this purpose, particularly with the growing development of
machine learning methods. Beyond differences between proposed C-index
estimators (e.g. Harrell's, Uno's and Antolini's), we demonstrate the existence
of a C-index multiverse among available R and python software, where seemingly
equal implementations can yield different results. This can undermine
reproducibility and complicate fair comparisons across models and studies. Key
variation sources include tie handling and adjustment to censoring.
Additionally, the absence of a standardised approach to summarise risk from
survival distributions, result in another source of variation dependent on
input types. We demonstrate the consequences of the C-index multiverse when
quantifying predictive performance for several survival models (from Cox
proportional hazards to recent deep learning approaches) on publicly available
breast cancer data, and semi-synthetic examples. Our work emphasises the need
for better reporting to improve transparency and reproducibility. This article
aims to be a useful guideline, helping analysts when navigating the multiverse,
providing unified documentation and highlighting potential pitfalls of existing
software. All code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 探索确定性多带图灵机的时间和空间复杂度关系，寻求时间复杂度对应下的空间模拟。

Method: 使用高度压缩定理重塑计算树，采用中点递归、路径势能等方法，结合代数重放引擎、无指针DFS和无索引流处理。

Result: 得到空间复杂度S(b)=O(b + log(t/b))，在b = Θ(√t)时为O(√t)，给出分支程序上界、强化二次时间下界、O(√t)空间认证解释器等。

Conclusion: 构造方法统一、可相对化且对标准模型选择稳健，在显式局部性假设下可扩展到几何d维模型。

Abstract: We prove a square-root space simulation for deterministic multitape Turing
machines, showing ${\rm TIME}[[t] \subseteq {\rm SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$. The key
step is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes
the canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run
into a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\log
T)$ for $T = \lceil t/b \rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ work at leaves, $O(1)$
at internal nodes, and edges that are logspace-checkable; semantic correctness
across merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ window replay at the unique
interface. The proof uses midpoint (balanced) recursion, a per-path potential
that bounds simultaneously active interfaces by $O(\log T)$, and an
indegree-capping replacement of multiway merges by balanced binary combiners.
Algorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a
constant-size field, together with pointerless DFS and index-free streaming,
ensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding
the additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b + \log(t/b))$ for block sizes $b \ge b_0$ with
$b_0 = \Theta(\log t)$, which at the canonical choice $b = \Theta(\sqrt{t})$
gives $O(\sqrt{t})$ space; the $b_0$ threshold rules out degenerate blocks
where addressing scratch would dominate the window footprint. The construction
is uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences
include branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$
bounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for
SPACE$[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and
$O(\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality
assumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models.

Abstract: Microbiome research has immense potential for unlocking insights into human
health and disease. A common goal in human microbiome research is identifying
subgroups of individuals with similar microbial composition that may be linked
to specific health states or environmental exposures. However, existing
clustering methods are often not equipped to accommodate the complex structure
of microbiome data and typically make limiting assumptions regarding the number
of clusters in the data which can bias inference. Designed for zero-inflated
multivariate compositional count data collected in microbiome research, we
propose a novel Bayesian semiparametric mixture modeling framework that
simultaneously learns the number of clusters in the data while performing
cluster allocation. In simulation, we demonstrate the clustering performance of
our method compared to distance- and model-based alternatives and the
importance of accommodating zero-inflation when present in the data. We then
apply the model to identify clusters in microbiome data collected in a study
designed to investigate the relation between gut microbial composition and
enteric diarrheal disease.

Abstract: In Bayesian statistics, the marginal likelihood is used for model selection
and averaging, yet it is often challenging to compute accurately for complex
models. Approaches such as bridge sampling, while effective, may suffer from
issues of high variability of the estimates. We present how to estimate Monte
Carlo standard error (MCSE) for bridge sampling, and how to diagnose the
reliability of MCSE estimates using Pareto-$\hat{k}$ and block reshuffling
diagnostics without the need to repeatedly re-run full posterior inference. We
demonstrate the behavior with increasingly more difficult simulated posteriors
and many real posteriors from the posteriordb database.

Conclusion: 所提出的数据融合方法在高分辨率人口健康指标估计上有较好效果。

Abstract: High-resolution estimates of population health indicators are critical for
precision public health. We propose a method for high-resolution estimation
that fuses distinct data sources: an unbiased, low-resolution data source (e.g.
aggregated administrative data) and a potentially biased, high-resolution data
source (e.g. individual-level online survey responses). We assume that the
potentially biased, high-resolution data source is generated from the
population under a model of sampling bias where observables can have arbitrary
impact on the probability of response but the difference in the log
probabilities of response between units with the same observables is linear in
the difference between sufficient statistics of their observables and outcomes.
Our data fusion method learns a distribution that is closest (in the sense of
KL divergence) to the online survey distribution and consistent with the
aggregated administrative data and our model of sampling bias. This method
outperforms baselines that rely on either data source alone on a testbed that
includes repeated measurements of three indicators measured by both the
(online) Household Pulse Survey and ground-truth data sources at two geographic
resolutions over the same time period.

*William Leeney,Alessio Gravina,Davide Bacciu*

TL;DR: 本文提出无监督反对称图神经网络（uAGNN）用于异质图社区检测，实验证明其在中高异质性设置中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图社区检测在异质图中极具挑战，图神经网络基于局部消息传递方案难以有效处理，因此需要能传播长距离信息的方法。

Method: 引入uAGNN，利用非耗散动力系统确保稳定性并有效传播长距离信息，采用反对称权重矩阵捕捉局部和全局图结构。

Result: 在十个数据集上的广泛实验表明，uAGNN在中高异质性设置中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: uAGNN有潜力成为不同图环境中无监督社区检测的强大工具。

Abstract: Community detection in graphs aims to cluster nodes into meaningful groups, a
task particularly challenging in heterophilic graphs, where nodes sharing
similarities and membership to the same community are typically distantly
connected. This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph
neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme
to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities.
In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information
during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in
heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric
Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach
leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to
propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight
matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the
limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten
datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium
heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range
dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for
unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种强化学习方法，直接优化类人机器人向SE(2)目标的运动，新奖励函数让运动自然高效，结果显示该方法优于标准方法且能从仿真迁移到硬件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的类人机器人运动方法多优化速度跟踪而非直接到达目标位姿，在短距离任务中效率低，需开发高效的短距离运动方法。

Method: 开发一种强化学习方法，使用基于星座的新奖励函数，引入基准测试框架评估性能。

Result: 提出的方法始终优于标准方法，且能成功从仿真迁移到硬件。

Conclusion: 针对性的奖励设计对实际短距离类人机器人运动很重要。

Abstract: Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute
task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical,
these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While
learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods
optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in
inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this
work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes
humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new
constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient
target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking
framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count
on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design
for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

Motivation: 传统分析方法对软机器人建模需精确物理特性知识，且单域学习映射难以跨域转移，软机器人材料会随时间退化。

Method: 引入基于CCGAN的域翻译框架，采用动态学习方法，模型从输入压力信号学习，条件为两域对应末端执行器位置和方向。

Result: 通过轨迹跟踪实验、噪声扰动和周期性测试，表明CCGAN - GP有效促进跨域技能转移。

Conclusion: CCGAN - GP为更具适应性和泛化性的软机器人控制器铺平道路。

Abstract: Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft
robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require
precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other
physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of
these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned
in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different
physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,
as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative
adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain
to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to
adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a
domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in
both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments
across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise
perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP
effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有类人-物体交互生成方法存在诸如不合理接触、穿透和不真实全身动作等问题，难以在物理环境中成功执行。

Method: 基于Diffusion Transformers预测关键动作并插值成平滑轨迹，设计接触感知的全身控制策略用强化学习训练，采用相互微调策略让生成模型和控制策略迭代优化。

Result: SimGenHOI能生成真实、多样且物理合理的类人-物体交互，在模拟中实现更高跟踪成功率，可完成长时操作任务。

Conclusion: SimGenHOI是有效的生成物理上合理的类人-物体交互的框架。

Abstract: Generating physically realistic humanoid-object interactions (HOI) is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing HOI generation approaches, such as
diffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible
contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder
successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of
generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and
physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,
object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These
key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into
smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To
ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy
trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while
correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we
introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the
control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and
tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates
realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,
achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and
enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance
on our project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/simgen_hoi.

Conclusion: 为基于物理的多智能体协作任务中LLMs的优势和失败模式提供新见解，有助于未来基准和架构改进。

Abstract: The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for
solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the
question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in
multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to
solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor,
prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known
graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying
needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a
suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant
actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new
insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded
multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and
architectural improvements.

Conclusion: DTWIL方法能有效解决ACIL中的问题，提升性能和样本效率。

Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring
safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications.
In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained
Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn
from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge
of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the
expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this
mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which
replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that
follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.
Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it
via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the
expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated
by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks
and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of
sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at

Method: 引入预训练阶段学习动力学表示，该表示源自转移动力学的分解；用受噪声对比估计启发的损失函数学习动力学表示。

Result: 在MuJoCo实验中，算法能用单条轨迹模仿专家策略；在真实四足机器人实验中，可利用模拟器数据的预训练表示从少量真实演示中学习行走。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能有效解决离线模仿学习中有限数据的问题。

Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation
learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited
expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics
representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We
first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL
lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to
learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be
learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the
reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We
present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to
learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on
MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with
as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can
leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to
walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

Method: 开发CountSketch的高效GPU实现，并应用于多草图技术和多草图最小二乘求解器。

Result: 多草图最小二乘求解器比正规方程快77%，数值稳定性更好，但相对残差范数有O(1)乘性因子。

Conclusion: 开发的CountSketch GPU实现有效，可提升多草图技术和求解器性能。

Abstract: Random sketching is a dimensionality reduction technique that approximately
preserves norms and singular values up to some $O(1)$ distortion factor with
high probability. The most popular sketches in literature are the Gaussian
sketch and the subsampled randomized Hadamard transform, while the CountSketch
has lower complexity. Combining two sketches, known as multisketching, offers
an inexpensive means of quickly reducing the dimension of a matrix by combining
a CountSketch and Gaussian sketch.
  However, there has been little investigation into high performance
CountSketch implementations. In this work, we develop an efficient GPU
implementation of the CountSketch, and demonstrate the performance of
multisketching using this technique. We also demonstrate the potential for
using this implementation within a multisketched least squares solver that is
up to $77\%$ faster than the normal equations with significantly better
numerical stability, at the cost of an $O(1)$ multiplicative factor introduced
into the relative residual norm.

Abstract: Background: Accurate diagnosis of wrist and hand fractures using radiographs
is essential in emergency care, but manual interpretation is slow and prone to
errors. Transformer-based models show promise in improving medical image
analysis, but their application to extremity fractures is limited. This study
addresses this gap by applying object detection transformers to wrist and hand
X-rays.
  Methods: We fine-tuned the RT-DETR and Co-DETR models, pre-trained on COCO,
using over 26,000 annotated X-rays from a proprietary clinical dataset. Each
image was labeled for fracture presence with bounding boxes. A ResNet-50
classifier was trained on cropped regions to refine abnormality classification.
Supervised contrastive learning was used to enhance embedding quality.
Performance was evaluated using AP@50, precision, and recall metrics, with
additional testing on real-world X-rays.
  Results: RT-DETR showed moderate results (AP@50 = 0.39), while Co-DETR
outperformed it with an AP@50 of 0.615 and faster convergence. The integrated
pipeline achieved 83.1% accuracy, 85.1% precision, and 96.4% recall on
real-world X-rays, demonstrating strong generalization across 13 fracture
types. Visual inspection confirmed accurate localization.
  Conclusion: Our Co-DETR-based pipeline demonstrated high accuracy and
clinical relevance in wrist and hand fracture detection, offering reliable
localization and differentiation of fracture types. It is scalable, efficient,
and suitable for real-time deployment in hospital workflows, improving
diagnostic speed and reliability in musculoskeletal radiology.

Abstract: Background: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a deep
learning-based automated segmentation method for hepatic anatomy (i.e.,
parenchyma, tumors, portal vein, hepatic vein and biliary tree) from the
hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. This method should ease the
clinical workflow of preoperative planning.
  Methods: Manual segmentation was performed on hepatobiliary phase MRI scans
from 90 consecutive patients who underwent liver surgery between January 2020
and October 2023. A deep learning network (nnU-Net v1) was trained on 72
patients with an extra focus on thin structures and topography preservation.
Performance was evaluated on an 18-patient test set by comparing automated and
manual segmentations using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Following
clinical integration, 10 segmentations (assessment dataset) were generated
using the network and manually refined for clinical use to quantify required
adjustments using DSC.
  Results: In the test set, DSCs were 0.97+/-0.01 for liver parenchyma,
0.80+/-0.04 for hepatic vein, 0.79+/-0.07 for biliary tree, 0.77+/-0.17 for
tumors, and 0.74+/-0.06 for portal vein. Average tumor detection rate was
76.6+/-24.1%, with a median of one false-positive per patient. The assessment
dataset showed minor adjustments were required for clinical use of the 3D
models, with high DSCs for parenchyma (1.00+/-0.00), portal vein (0.98+/-0.01)
and hepatic vein (0.95+/-0.07). Tumor segmentation exhibited greater
variability (DSC 0.80+/-0.27). During prospective clinical use, the model
detected three additional tumors initially missed by radiologists.
  Conclusions: The proposed nnU-Net-based segmentation method enables accurate
and automated delineation of hepatic anatomy. This enables 3D planning to be
applied efficiently as a standard-of-care for every patient undergoing liver
surgery.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an essential diagnostic tool for
assessing knee injuries. However, manual interpretation of MRI slices remains
time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. This study presents a
systematic evaluation of various deep learning architectures combined with
explainable AI (xAI) techniques for automated region of interest (ROI)
detection in knee MRI scans. We investigate both supervised and self-supervised
approaches, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformers (ViT), and
multiple U-Net variants augmented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
classifiers. To enhance interpretability and clinical relevance, we integrate
xAI methods such as Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps. Model performance is assessed
using AUC for classification and PSNR/SSIM for reconstruction quality, along
with qualitative ROI visualizations. Our results demonstrate that ResNet50
consistently excels in classification and ROI identification, outperforming
transformer-based models under the constraints of the MRNet dataset. While
hybrid U-Net + MLP approaches show potential for leveraging spatial features in
reconstruction and interpretability, their classification performance remains
lower. Grad-CAM consistently provided the most clinically meaningful
explanations across architectures. Overall, CNN-based transfer learning emerges
as the most effective approach for this dataset, while future work with
larger-scale pretraining may better unlock the potential of transformer models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained immense interest for their generative
capabilities, specifically the high quality and diversity of the synthesized
data. However, examples of their applications in 3D medical imaging are still
scarce, especially in cardiology. Generating diverse realistic cardiac
anatomies is crucial for applications such as in silico trials,
electromechanical computer simulations, or data augmentations for machine
learning models. In this work, we investigate the application of Latent
Diffusion Models (LDMs) for generating 3D meshes of human cardiac anatomies. To
this end, we propose a novel LDM architecture -- MeshLDM. We apply the proposed
model on a dataset of 3D meshes of left ventricular cardiac anatomies from
patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate its performance in terms
of both qualitative and quantitative clinical and 3D mesh reconstruction
metrics. The proposed MeshLDM successfully captures characteristics of the
cardiac shapes at end-diastolic (relaxation) and end-systolic (contraction)
cardiac phases, generating meshes with a 2.4% difference in population mean
compared to the gold standard.

Abstract: Live cell culture is crucial in biomedical studies for analyzing cell
properties and dynamics in vitro. This study focuses on segmenting unstained
live cells imaged with bright-field microscopy. While many segmentation
approaches exist for microscopic images, none consistently address the
challenges of bright-field live-cell imaging with high throughput, where
temporal phenotype changes, low contrast, noise, and motion-induced blur from
cellular movement remain major obstacles. We developed a low-cost CNN-based
pipeline incorporating comparative analysis of frozen encoders within a unified
U-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms, instance-aware systems,
adaptive loss functions, hard instance retraining, dynamic learning rates,
progressive mechanisms to mitigate overfitting, and an ensemble technique. The
model was validated on a public dataset featuring diverse live cell variants,
showing consistent competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods, achieving 93%
test accuracy and an average F1-score of 89% (std. 0.07) on low-contrast,
noisy, and blurry images. Notably, the model was trained primarily on
bright-field images with limited exposure to phase-contrast microscopy (<10%),
yet it generalized effectively to the phase-contrast LIVECell dataset,
demonstrating modality, robustness and strong performance. This highlights its
potential for real-world laboratory deployment across imaging conditions. The
model requires minimal compute power and is adaptable using basic deep learning
setups such as Google Colab, making it practical for training on other cell
variants. Our pipeline outperforms existing methods in robustness and precision
for bright-field microscopy segmentation. The code and dataset are available

Abstract: This paper proposes a fresh `meta-game' perspective on the problem of
algorithmic collusion in pricing games a la Bertrand. Economists have
interpreted the fact that algorithms can learn to price collusively as tacit
collusion. We argue instead that the co-parametrization of algorithms -- that
we show is necessary to obtain algorithmic collusion -- requires algorithm
designer(s) to engage in explicit collusion by algorithm orchestration. To
highlight this, we model a meta-game of algorithm parametrization that is
played by algorithm designers, and the relevant strategic analyses at that
level reveal new equilibrium and collusion phenomena.

### [180] [Towards Low-Latency Tracking of Multiple Speakers With Short-Context Speaker Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14115)
*Taous Iatariene,Alexandre Guérin,Romain Serizel*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出基于知识蒸馏的双说话人混合语音短上下文嵌入提取方法，研究块级身份重分配可行性，模型短上下文提取有效且更抗重叠，但块级重分配需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常见说话人嵌入提取器在短时间上下文和重叠语音处理上有困难，长期身份重分配会增加跟踪系统错误概率，影响身份重分配。

Method: 提出基于知识蒸馏（KD）的训练方法用于从两个说话人混合语音中提取短上下文说话人嵌入，利用波束形成技术利用感兴趣说话人的空间信息减少重叠，研究块级身份重分配可行性。

Result: 蒸馏模型在短上下文嵌入提取方面有效，对重叠更鲁棒，块级重分配结果表明需进一步工作以更有效处理同时语音。

Conclusion: 基于KD的方法在短上下文说话人嵌入提取有成效，但块级身份重分配处理同时语音有待改进。

Abstract: Speaker embeddings are promising identity-related features that can enhance
the identity assignment performance of a tracking system by leveraging its
spatial predictions, i.e, by performing identity reassignment. Common speaker
embedding extractors usually struggle with short temporal contexts and
overlapping speech, which imposes long-term identity reassignment to exploit
longer temporal contexts. However, this increases the probability of tracking
system errors, which in turn impacts negatively on identity reassignment. To
address this, we propose a Knowledge Distillation (KD) based training approach
for short context speaker embedding extraction from two speaker mixtures. We
leverage the spatial information of the speaker of interest using beamforming
to reduce overlap. We study the feasibility of performing identity reassignment
over blocks of fixed size, i.e., blockwise identity reassignment, to go towards
a low-latency speaker embedding based tracking system. Results demonstrate that
our distilled models are effective at short-context embedding extraction and
more robust to overlap. Although, blockwise reassignment results indicate that
further work is needed to handle simultaneous speech more effectively.

### [181] [EmoSLLM: Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of LLMs for Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14130)
*Hugo Thimonier,Antony Perzo,Renaud Seguier*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出一种微调大语言模型（LLM）结合音频和文本特征进行情感预测的新方法，实验显示高效且性能优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音情感识别需捕捉语言和副语言线索，现有工作表明LLM有处理多模态任务能力，因此提出结合音频和文本进行情感预测的方法。

Method: 先使用音频特征提取器提取特征，通过可学习接口模块映射到LLM表示空间，LLM输入包含转换后的音频特征、自然语言特征和文本提示，采用低秩适配（LoRA）进行参数高效微调。

Result: 在标准情感识别基准测试中，模型性能除一个外优于所有现有语音 - 文本LLM，且所需参数不到竞争方法一半。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效整合多模态输入进行基于语音的情感理解，同时保持显著计算效率。

Abstract: Emotion recognition from speech is a challenging task that requires capturing
both linguistic and paralinguistic cues, with critical applications in
human-computer interaction and mental health monitoring. Recent works have
highlighted the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks
outside of the sole natural language area. In particular, recent approaches
have investigated coupling LLMs with other data modalities by using pre-trained
backbones and different fusion mechanisms. This work proposes a novel approach
that fine-tunes an LLM with audio and text representations for emotion
prediction. Our method first extracts audio features using an audio feature
extractor, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a
learnable interfacing module. The LLM takes as input (1) the transformed audio
features, (2) additional features in the form of natural language (e.g., the
transcript), and (3) a textual prompt describing the emotion prediction task.
To efficiently adapt the LLM to this multimodal task, we employ Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental
results on standard emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our model
outperforms all but one existing Speech-Text LLMs in the literature, while
requiring less than half the parameters of competing approaches. This
highlights our approach's effectiveness in integrating multi-modal inputs for
speech-based emotion understanding while maintaining significant computational
efficiency.

### [182] [A Study of the Scale Invariant Signal to Distortion Ratio in Speech Separation with Noisy References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14623)
*Simon Dahl Jepsen,Mads Græsbøll Christensen,Jesper Rindom Jensen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文研究含噪训练参考下用SI - SDR作语音分离评估和训练目标的影响，提出增强参考和数据增强方法，评估显示分离语音噪声减少但处理参考可能引入伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在训练参考包含噪声时，使用SI - SDR作为监督语音分离的评估和训练目标的影响。

Method: 推导含噪参考下的SI - SDR，提出增强参考和用WHAM! 增强混合语音的方法，用NISQA.v2指标评估模型。

Result: 分离语音噪声减少，但处理参考可能引入伪影，限制整体质量提升，在测试集上发现SI - SDR与感知噪声呈负相关。

Conclusion: 噪声会限制可达到的SI - SDR，或导致分离输出出现不期望的噪声。

Abstract: This paper examines the implications of using the Scale-Invariant
Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR) as both evaluation and training objective
in supervised speech separation, when the training references contain noise, as
is the case with the de facto benchmark WSJ0-2Mix. A derivation of the SI-SDR
with noisy references reveals that noise limits the achievable SI-SDR, or leads
to undesired noise in the separated outputs. To address this, a method is
proposed to enhance references and augment the mixtures with WHAM!, aiming to
train models that avoid learning noisy references. Two models trained on these
enhanced datasets are evaluated with the non-intrusive NISQA.v2 metric. Results
show reduced noise in separated speech but suggest that processing references
may introduce artefacts, limiting overall quality gains. Negative correlation
is found between SI-SDR and perceived noisiness across models on the WSJ0-2Mix
and Libri2Mix test sets, underlining the conclusion from the derivation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出CCFC框架应对大语言模型越狱攻击，降低攻击成功率且不影响良性查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越狱攻击对大语言模型安全部署构成挑战，需有效防御。

Method: 通过少样本提示分离用户查询语义核心，用核心仅和核心 - 全核心双轨评估查询，最后进行安全一致性检查选最终响应。

Result: CCFC比现有防御方法将攻击成功率降低50 - 75%，不影响良性查询效果。

Conclusion: CCFC持续优于现有提示级防御，为大语言模型安全部署提供实用有效方案。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious challenge to the safe deployment of large
language models (LLMs). We introduce CCFC (Core & Core-Full-Core), a
dual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs'
vulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks.
CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot
prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a
core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or
prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural
patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response
is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring
robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC
cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against
strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on
benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer
LLM deployment.

Method: 提出DA - MTL多任务学习框架，在九个数据集和四个骨干模型上评估，并分析跨模态、跨语言模式及对抗混淆技术下的鲁棒性。

Result: DA - MTL在多语言和不同大语言模型来源上表现出色，能捕捉各任务特征并共享见解，提升两个任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have demonstrated
remarkable abilities in generating natural language. However, they also pose
security and integrity challenges. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on
distinguishing AI-generated content from human-written text, with most
solutions tailored for English. Meanwhile, authorship attribution--determining
which specific LLM produced a given text--has received comparatively little
attention despite its importance in forensic analysis. In this paper, we
present DA-MTL, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously addresses
both text detection and authorship attribution. We evaluate DA-MTL on nine
datasets and four backbone models, demonstrating its strong performance across
multiple languages and LLM sources. Our framework captures each task's unique
characteristics and shares insights between them, which boosts performance in
both tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of cross-modal and
cross-lingual patterns and assess the framework's robustness against
adversarial obfuscation techniques. Our findings offer valuable insights into
LLM behavior and the generalization of both detection and authorship
attribution.

Conclusion: 金融科技从业者需提高对机器学习模型安全和可信度的认识，有必要为CCFD算法开发强大的防御机制。

Abstract: Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is a critical application of Machine
Learning (ML) in the financial sector, where accurately identifying fraudulent
transactions is essential for mitigating financial losses. ML models have
demonstrated their effectiveness in fraud detection task, in particular with
the tabular dataset. While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in
computer vision and deep learning, their impacts on the ML models, particularly
those trained on CCFD tabular datasets, remains largely unexplored. These
latent vulnerabilities pose significant threats to the security and stability
of the financial industry, especially in high-value transactions where losses
could be substantial. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a holistic
framework that investigate the robustness of CCFD ML model against adversarial
perturbations under different circumstances. Specifically, the gradient-based
attack methods are incorporated into the tabular credit card transaction data
in both black- and white-box adversarial attacks settings. Our findings confirm
that tabular data is also susceptible to subtle perturbations, highlighting the
need for heightened awareness among financial technology practitioners
regarding ML model security and trustworthiness. Furthermore, the experiments
by transferring adversarial samples from gradient-based attack method to
non-gradient-based models also verify our findings. Our results demonstrate
that such attacks remain effective, emphasizing the necessity of developing
robust defenses for CCFD algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文针对程序工作负载高维挑战，提出基于分层大语言模型的芯片小核设计生成框架MAHL，实验表明其在生成准确性和PPA优化上有良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着程序工作负载规模和算法复杂度增加，传统方法面临高维挑战，且现有LLM驱动的芯片小核设计存在诸多问题，需要新方法。

Method: 提出MAHL框架，包含六个代理，实现AI算法 - 硬件映射，有分层描述生成、检索增强代码生成等组件。

Result: MAHL显著提高简单RTL设计生成准确性，在最佳情况下将实际芯片小核设计生成准确率从0提升到0.72，与先进的CLARIE相比，在某些优化目标下PPA结果相当或更优。

Conclusion: MAHL框架能有效解决现有芯片小核设计问题，提升设计生成效率和PPA指标。

Abstract: As program workloads (e.g., AI) increase in size and algorithmic complexity,
the primary challenge lies in their high dimensionality, encompassing computing
cores, array sizes, and memory hierarchies. To overcome these obstacles,
innovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited
from machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis,
placement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently
demonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL)
generation, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an
advanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However,
LLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high
validation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet
design capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based
chiplet design generation framework that features six agents which
collaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical
description generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based
validation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components
together enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized
Power, Performance and Area (PPA). Experiments show that MAHL not only
significantly improves the generation accuracy of simple RTL design, but also
increases the generation accuracy of real-world chiplet design, evaluated by
Pass@5, from 0 to 0.72 compared to conventional LLMs under the best-case
scenario. Compared to state-of-the-art CLARIE (expert-based), MAHL achieves
comparable or even superior PPA results under certain optimization objectives.

Abstract: Large Artificial Intelligence (AI) training workloads spanning several tens
of thousands of GPUs present unique power management challenges. These arise
due to the high variability in power consumption during the training. Given the
synchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a
computation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a
communication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because
compute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large
power swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with
the increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from
the frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical
frequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid
infrastructure. Therefore, to continue scaling AI training workloads safely, we
need to stabilize the power of such workloads. This paper introduces the
challenge with production data and explores innovative solutions across the
stack: software, GPU hardware, and datacenter infrastructure. We present the
pros and cons of each of these approaches and finally present a multi-pronged
approach to solving the challenge. The proposed solutions are rigorously tested
using a combination of real hardware and Microsoft's in-house cloud power
simulator, providing critical insights into the efficacy of these interventions
under real-world conditions.

Motivation: 以往无损合成方法构建选择网络时忽视选择质量，不确定是否有助于有效技术映射。

Method: 引入基于选择网络的合成和映射新流程，包括代表逻辑锥搜索、通过等式饱和进行结构突变、优先级排序选择等。

Result: Cristal在延迟导向模式下面积/延迟平均降低3.85%/8.35%，面积导向模式下降低0.11%/2.74%，大规模案例运行时间减少63.77%。

Conclusion: Cristal构建的选择数量少但质量高，在映射后阶段表现优于ABC的方法。

Abstract: Choice network construction is a critical technique for alleviating
structural bias issues in Boolean optimization, equivalence checking, and
technology mapping. Previous works on lossless synthesis utilize independent
optimization to generate multiple snapshots, and use simulation and SAT solvers
to identify functionally equivalent nodes. These nodes are then merged into a
subject graph with choice nodes. However, such methods often neglect the
quality of these choices, raising the question of whether they truly contribute
to effective technology mapping.
  This paper introduces Cristal, a novel methodology and framework for
constructing Boolean choice networks. Specifically, Cristal introduces a new
flow of choice network-based synthesis and mapping, including representative
logic cone search, structural mutation for generating diverse choice structures
via equality saturation, and priority-ranking choice selection along with
choice network construction and validation. Through these techniques, Cristal
constructs fewer but higher-quality choices.
  Our experimental results demonstrate that Cristal outperforms the
state-of-the-art Boolean choice network construction implemented in ABC in the
post-mapping stage, achieving average reductions of 3.85%/8.35% (area/delay) in
delay-oriented mode, 0.11%/2.74% in area-oriented mode, and a 63.77% runtime
reduction on large-scale cases across a diverse set of combinational circuits
from the IWLS 2005, ISCAS'89, and EPFL benchmark suites.

Conclusion: 提出的新颖CIM数据流能有效减少缓冲流量，降低数据传输能耗和延迟，解决CIM宏加速深度卷积的问题。

Abstract: Computing-In-Memory (CIM) offers a potential solution to the memory wall
issue and can achieve high energy efficiency by minimizing data movement,
making it a promising architecture for edge AI devices. Lightweight models like
MobileNet and EfficientNet, which utilize depthwise convolution for feature
extraction, have been developed for these devices. However, CIM macros often
face challenges in accelerating depthwise convolution, including
underutilization of CIM memory and heavy buffer traffic. The latter, in
particular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and
energy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that
significantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving
memory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is
grounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper.
When applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer
traffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and
latency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline
(conventional weight-stationary dataflow).

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

TL;DR: 提出LENS框架解决现有方法在测试时缺乏显式思维链推理的问题，在基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在测试时忽略显式思维链推理，限制了对未见提示和领域的泛化能力。

Method: 引入LENS可扩展强化学习框架，联合优化推理过程和分割，提出统一强化学习奖励。

Result: 使用Qwen2.5 - VL - 3B - Instruct模型，LENS在RefCOCO等基准测试中平均cIoU达81.2%，优于GLaMM方法。

Conclusion: 强化学习驱动的思维链推理是文本提示分割的强大先验，为更具泛化性的分割模型提供实用途径。

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at

Abstract: We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for
embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation
model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling
flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture,
RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding,
object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a
region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing
fine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise
interactions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an
egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data.
Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for
evaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will
advance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents
and facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks. The code, model
checkpoints, and benchmark are available at:

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer
vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep
learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains
fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a
comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature
across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as
online, active, and continual learning. We examine the state of VAD across
three major application categories: human-centric, vehicle-centric, and
environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design
considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and
limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields,
we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both
theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This
survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also
drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection,
including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to
real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在糖尿病视网膜病变分级等高风险任务的临床应用需可靠的不确定性量化，而标准训练实践（如数据增强）与共形预测保证有效性的相互作用尚不明确。

Method: 使用DDR数据集，评估ResNet - 50和CoaT两种骨干架构在无增强、标准几何变换、CLAHE、Mixup和CutMix五种增强机制下的表现，并分析共形指标。

Result: Mixup和CutMix能提高预测准确性，产生更可靠和高效的不确定性估计；CLAHE会对模型确定性产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 构建医学影像可信AI系统时，需将数据增强策略与下游不确定性量化协同设计。

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

Motivation: 牙科CBCT扫描在诊断和治疗规划中重要性渐增，但生成具有细粒度控制的解剖学逼真扫描仍是医学图像合成的挑战。

Method: 提出新颖的条件扩散框架，集成基于小波的去噪扩散、FiLM调节和掩码损失函数。

Result: 模型在多项任务评估中表现良好，FID分数低，修复性能强，在未见扫描上SSIM值超0.91。

Conclusion: 该工作无需重新扫描即可对牙列进行逼真的局部修改，为牙科AI工作流提供了机会。

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and
treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained
control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we
propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume
generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control
over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based
denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus
learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across
diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis,
using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong
fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,
and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,
localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens
opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data
augmentation in dental AI workflows. The codes are available at:

Method: 提出OccluNet，结合YOLOX和基于transformer的时间注意力机制，探索两种时空变体，与YOLOv11基线对比。

Result: 在DSA图像上评估，精度89.02%，召回率74.87%，显著优于基线模型，两种注意力变体性能相近。

Conclusion: OccluNet能有效捕获时间一致特征，可用于DSA序列的血管阻塞自动化检测。

Abstract: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy
(EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital
subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical
complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention
variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at

Method: 使用行为克隆端到端训练P2P0.1，结合有标签的人类游戏演示和无标签的公开视频，用逆动力学模型估算动作，用仅解码器的Transformer处理大动作空间。

Result: 在简单的Roblox和经典MS - DOS游戏中有胜任的游戏表现，进行了无标签数据的消融实验。

Conclusion: 概述了达到专家级、文本条件控制所需的扩展和评估步骤。

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,
personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must
rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,
ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps
required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

*Dian Ning,Dong Seog Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出类间关系损失解决单阶段多目标检测中小目标梯度更新问题，还构建新数据集，提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于IoU的损失函数在训练时无法正确更新小目标梯度，多目标更新时小目标梯度学习受影响。

Method: 提出类间关系损失，利用对象间空间关系，若预测的小目标边界框不在大目标内则添加损失惩罚；构建新的小车辆多车牌数据集SVMLP。

Result: 所提ICR损失惩罚可添加到现有基于IoU的损失中，在YOLOv12 - T和UAV - DETR上mAP$^{	ext{test}}_{50}$分别提升10.3%和1.6%。

Conclusion: 所提类间关系损失和新数据集有效提升了单阶段多目标检测性能，且无需额外超参数调整。

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HRC - Pose框架用于类别级目标姿态估计，利用对比学习学习点云表示，实验证明其有效性和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有类别级目标姿态估计方法仅依赖6D姿态作为监督信号，未明确捕捉姿态的内在连续性，导致预测不一致和泛化性差。

Method: 提出HRC - Pose框架，将目标姿态解耦为旋转和平移分量分别编码，引入基于6D姿态感知分层排序方案的多任务、多类别对比学习策略，设计分别处理旋转感知和平移感知嵌入的姿态估计模块。

Result: HRC - Pose成功学习到连续特征空间，在REAL275和CAMERA25基准上优于现有仅深度的最先进方法且能实时运行。

Conclusion: HRC - Pose方法有效，有实际应用潜力，代码开源。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

Motivation: 现有工业异常检测的统计和数据驱动方法受标注数据集和动态生产条件限制，而基础模型感知能力进步带来新机遇。

Method: 提出PB - IAD框架，利用基础模型多模态和推理能力，含特定提示模板和预处理模块，以用户为中心设计；用GPT - 4.1在多场景评估，与PatchCore等方法对比。

Result: 在多场景评估中表现优越，在数据稀疏和少样本场景仅通过语义指令就取得良好效果。

Conclusion: PB - IAD框架在工业异常检测中表现优秀，尤其适用于数据稀疏场景，为工业异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure
product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven
approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their
adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive
annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.
Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide
promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This
paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel
framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

Motivation: 点云视频时空无序阻碍选择性状态空间模型（SSMs）单向建模，需新方法处理点云视频。

Method: 提出UST - SSM，引入STSS重组无序点，用STSA聚合特征补偿缺失信息，用TIS增强时间交互。

Result: 在MSR - Action3D、NTU RGB+D和Synthia 4D数据集上实验验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: UST - SSM能有效解决点云视频时空无序问题，用于人体动作识别。

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is
available at https://github.com/wangzy01/UST-SSM.

Method: 提出深度平衡规范化器（DEC）来改善模型的局部尺度等变性，可融入现有网络架构并适配预训练模型。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，DEC提升了ViT、DeiT、Swin和BEiT四种流行预训练深度网络的模型性能和局部尺度一致性。

Conclusion: DEC能有效处理尺度变化，提升模型性能和局部尺度一致性。

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效利用文档冗余，改进OCR系统在低质量数据上的识别效果。

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

TL;DR: 提出多帧车牌恢复与识别框架MF - LPR²，构建RLPR数据集评估，实验中在图像恢复和识别上表现优于多个基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练先验的生成模型无法可靠恢复低质量车牌图像，存在严重伪影和失真问题。

Method: 提出MF - LPR²框架，利用光流估计器和算法检测纠正错误光流估计，构建RLPR数据集评估。

Result: MF - LPR²在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS上显著优于八个恢复模型，识别准确率达86.44%，优于十一个基线模型。

Conclusion: 过滤和细化算法对性能提升有显著贡献。

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

TL;DR: 提出无训练图像配准管道，在两基准测试中表现良好，提供临床配准实用通用方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像配准方法需大量训练数据，限制临床应用，需克服该局限。

Method: 提出基于冻结DINOv3编码器和特征空间中测试时优化变形场的无训练管道。

Result: 在Abdomen MR - CT和ACDC心脏MRI基准测试中取得准确结果，有较好的DSC、HD95和SDLogJ指标。

Conclusion: 测试时在紧凑基础特征空间操作可提供无需额外训练的临床配准实用通用解决方案。

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

TL;DR: 提出 TransLight 框架实现高保真、高自由度光效转移，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光照编辑方法难以同时实现光效定制控制和内容完整性保留，在复杂光效转移任务中效果不佳。

Method: 先通过 Generative Decoupling 用两个微调扩散模型分离图像内容和光效，生成图像 - 内容 - 光照三元组数据集；再用 IC - Light 作为生成模型，以三元组训练，注入参考光照图像作为额外条件信号。

Result: TransLight 模型能实现多样化光效的定制化和自然转移，是首个成功跨不同图像转移光效的方法。

Conclusion: TransLight 提供了比现有技术更定制化的光照控制，为光照协调和编辑研究开辟新方向。

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

<details>

Motivation: 对流云模拟中，等值线树简化需体积度量，传统重采样方法会使数据量剧增。

Method: 使用包裹体质心的Delaunay四面体化作为输入，在Viskores中用图适配器扩展等值线树简化，采用前缀和式超扫描实现并行计算。

Result: 直接在包裹体上计算等值线树比在重采样网格上计算快几个数量级，且分割质量更好，避免插值伪影。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在对流云模拟的等值线树简化中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Many scientific and engineering problems are modelled by simulating scalar
fields defined either on space-filling meshes (Eulerian) or as particles
(Lagrangian). For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as
contour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out
small-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations,
simplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than
persistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting
regular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data
onto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a
high sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for
processing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to
parcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using
Delaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input. Instead of
relying on a volume approximation by counting regular vertices -- as was done
for cubic meshes -- we adapt the 2D area splines reported by Bajaj et al.
10.1145/259081.259279, and Zhou et al. 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2796555. We implement
this in Viskores (formerly called VTK-m) as prefix-sum style hypersweeps for
parallel efficiency and show how it can be generalized to compute any
integrable property. Finally, our results reveal that contour trees computed
directly on the parcels are orders of magnitude faster than computing them on a
resampled grid, while also arguably offering better quality segmentation,
avoiding interpolation artifacts.

Conclusion: 对扩展高斯分布的希尔伯特几何进行了研究，且提及了该几何在处理扩展高斯分布方面有潜在应用。

Abstract: The extended Gaussian family is the closure of the Gaussian family obtained
by completing the Gaussian family with the counterpart elements induced by
degenerate covariance or degenerate precision matrices, or a mix of both
degeneracies. The parameter space of the extended Gaussian family forms a
symmetric positive semi-definite matrix bicone, i.e. two partial symmetric
positive semi-definite matrix cones joined at their bases. In this paper, we
study the Hilbert geometry of such an open bounded convex symmetric
positive-definite bicone. We report the closed-form formula for the
corresponding Hilbert metric distance and study exhaustively its invariance
properties. We also touch upon potential applications of this geometry for
dealing with extended Gaussian distributions.

Conclusion: 访问轨迹在量子程序和硬件分析等场景有应用，可作为侧信道高精度恢复量子程序。

Abstract: Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices
that employ error correction. A promising quantum error-correcting code for
large-scale quantum computing is the surface code. For this code,
Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery,
i.e. merging and splitting of encoded qubit patches on a 2D grid. Lattice
surgery operations result in space-time patterns of activity that are defined
in this work as access traces. This work demonstrates that the access traces
reveal when, where, and how logical qubits interact. Leveraging this
formulation, this work further introduces TraceQ, a trace-based reconstruction
framework that is able to reconstruct the quantum circuit dataflow just by
observing the patch activity at each trace entry. The framework is supported by
heuristics for handling inherent ambiguity in the traces, and demonstrates its
effectiveness on a range of synthetic fault-tolerant quantum benchmarks. The
access traces can have applications in a wide range of scenarios, enabling
analysis and profiling of execution of quantum programs and the hardware they
run on. As one example use of TraceQ, this work investigates whether such
traces can act as a side channel through which an observer can recover the
circuit's structure and identify known subroutines in a larger program or even
whole programs. The findings show that indeed the minimal access traces can be
used to recover subroutines or even whole quantum programs with very high
accuracy. Only a single trace per program execution is needed and the
processing can be done fully offline. Along with the custom heuristics,
advanced subgraph matching algorithms used in this work enable a high rate of
locating the subroutines while executing in minimal time.

Method: 基于图上的游戏，利用LTLf/PPLTL的DFA技术构建游戏竞技场，提出基于Emerson - Lei游戏的符号求解器和Manna - Pnueli游戏求解器。

Result: 实现求解器并评估性能，Manna - Pnueli游戏通常有显著优势，但不绝对。

Conclusion: 结合两种方法可进一步提升实际性能。

Abstract: Recently, the Manna-Pnueli Hierarchy has been used to define the temporal
logics LTLfp and PPLTLp, which allow to use finite-trace LTLf/PPLTL techniques
in infinite-trace settings while achieving the expressiveness of full LTL. In
this paper, we present the first actual solvers for reactive synthesis in these
logics. These are based on games on graphs that leverage DFA-based techniques
from LTLf/PPLTL to construct the game arena. We start with a symbolic solver
based on Emerson-Lei games, which reduces lower-class properties (guarantee,
safety) to higher ones (recurrence, persistence) before solving the game. We
then introduce Manna-Pnueli games, which natively embed Manna-Pnueli objectives
into the arena. These games are solved by composing solutions to a DAG of
simpler Emerson-Lei games, resulting in a provably more efficient approach. We
implemented the solvers and practically evaluated their performance on a range
of representative formulas. The results show that Manna-Pnueli games often
offer significant advantages, though not universally, indicating that combining
both approaches could further enhance practical performance.

spanning a solar cycle from May 2010 to July 2024. To ensure suitability for ML
tasks, the data has been preprocessed, including correction of spacecraft roll
angles, orbital adjustments, exposure normalization, and degradation
compensation. We also provide auxiliary application benchmark datasets
complementing the core SDO dataset. These provide benchmark applications for
central heliophysics and space weather tasks such as active region
segmentation, active region emergence forecasting, coronal field extrapolation,
solar flare prediction, solar EUV spectra prediction, and solar wind speed
estimation. By establishing a unified, standardized data collection, this
dataset aims to facilitate benchmarking, enhance reproducibility, and

Abstract: Heliophysics is central to understanding and forecasting space weather events
and solar activity. Despite decades of high-resolution observations from the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), most models remain task-specific and
constrained by scarce labeled data, limiting their capacity to generalize
across solar phenomena. We introduce Surya, a 366M parameter foundation model
for heliophysics designed to learn general-purpose solar representations from
multi-instrument SDO observations, including eight Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) channels and five Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) products. Surya
employs a spatiotemporal transformer architecture with spectral gating and
long--short range attention, pretrained on high-resolution solar image
forecasting tasks and further optimized through autoregressive rollout tuning.
Zero-shot evaluations demonstrate its ability to forecast solar dynamics and
flare events, while downstream fine-tuning with parameter-efficient Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) shows strong performance on solar wind forecasting, active
region segmentation, solar flare forecasting, and EUV spectra. Surya is the
first foundation model in heliophysics that uses time advancement as a pretext
task on full-resolution SDO data. Its novel architecture and performance
suggest that the model is able to learn the underlying physics behind solar
evolution.

Abstract: Humans regularly navigate an overwhelming amount of information via text
media, whether reading articles, browsing social media, or interacting with
chatbots. Confusion naturally arises when new information conflicts with or
exceeds a reader's comprehension or prior knowledge, posing a challenge for
learning. In this study, we present a multimodal investigation of
reading-induced confusion using EEG and eye tracking. We collected neural and
gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from
diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential
(ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and
integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed
analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during
naturalistic reading. Using machine learning, we show that multimodal (EEG +
eye tracking) models improve classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal
baselines, reaching an average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and a
best accuracy of 89.6%. Our results highlight the dominance of the brain's
temporal regions in these neural signatures of confusion, suggesting avenues
for wearable, low-electrode brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for real-time
monitoring. These findings lay the foundation for developing adaptive systems
that dynamically detect and respond to user confusion, with potential
applications in personalized learning, human-computer interaction, and

Abstract: The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is undergoing a rapid
transformation, moving beyond its historical function as an instructional tool
towards a new potential as an active participant in the learning process. This
shift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of
proactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual
framework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI
interaction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel
conceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as
a tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of
escalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an
Adaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a
Co-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural
theories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this
framework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and
responsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a
critical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration,
examining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared
intentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while
AI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed
as a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant
implications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda
for AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning
environments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI.

Result: 归因分析显示ACER代理能从DVH输入识别剂量违规区域并调参；代理归因 - 违规相似性与调参步骤、调参空间熵等相关；高绩效代理能有效识别违规并采用全局调参策略。

Conclusion: 提升代理决策过程可解释性或增强临床医生信任，启发自动治疗计划新策略。

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to uncover the opaque decision-making process of
an artificial intelligence (AI) agent for automatic treatment planning.
  Approach: We examined a previously developed AI agent based on the
Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER) network, which automatically tunes
treatment planning parameters (TPPs) for inverse planning in prostate cancer
intensity modulated radiotherapy. We selected multiple checkpoint ACER agents
from different stages of training and applied an explainable AI (EXAI) method
to analyze the attribution from dose-volume histogram (DVH) inputs to
TPP-tuning decisions. We then assessed each agent's planning efficacy and
efficiency and evaluated their policy and final TPP tuning spaces. Combining
these analyses, we systematically examined how ACER agents generated
high-quality treatment plans in response to different DVH inputs.
  Results: Attribution analysis revealed that ACER agents progressively learned
to identify dose-violation regions from DVH inputs and promote appropriate
TPP-tuning actions to mitigate them. Organ-wise similarities between DVH
attributions and dose-violation reductions ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 across
tested agents. Agents with stronger attribution-violation similarity required
fewer tuning steps (~12-13 vs. 22), exhibited a more concentrated TPP-tuning
space with lower entropy (~0.3 vs. 0.6), converged on adjusting only a few
TPPs, and showed smaller discrepancies between practical and theoretical tuning
steps. Putting together, these findings indicate that high-performing ACER
agents can effectively identify dose violations from DVH inputs and employ a
global tuning strategy to achieve high-quality treatment planning, much like
skilled human planners.
  Significance: Better interpretability of the agent's decision-making process
may enhance clinician trust and inspire new strategies for automatic treatment
planning.

Motivation: 公开语音生物标志物数据集质量不一致、可用性有限，限制了其在临床的应用。

Method: 使用FAIR数据成熟度模型和结构化、优先加权评分方法，在子原则、原则和综合层面评估数据集的FAIR性。

Result: 数据集可查找性高，可访问性、互操作性和可重用性存在差异和弱点；心理健康数据集FAIR得分差异更大，神经退行性疾病数据集稍显一致；存储库选择显著影响FAIR得分。

Conclusion: 建议采用结构化、特定领域的元数据标准，优先选择符合FAIR的存储库，常规应用结构化FAIR评估框架，以提高数据集质量和临床实用性。

Abstract: Voice biomarkers--human-generated acoustic signals such as speech, coughing,
and breathing--are promising tools for scalable, non-invasive detection and
monitoring of mental health and neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, their clinical
adoption remains constrained by inconsistent quality and limited usability of
publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we present the first
systematic FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) evaluation of
27 publicly available voice biomarker datasets focused on these disease areas.
Using the FAIR Data Maturity Model and a structured, priority-weighted scoring
method, we assessed FAIRness at subprinciple, principle, and composite levels.
Our analysis revealed consistently high Findability but substantial variability
and weaknesses in Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Mental
health datasets exhibited greater variability in FAIR scores, while
neurodegenerative datasets were slightly more consistent. Repository choice
also significantly influenced FAIRness scores. To enhance dataset quality and
clinical utility, we recommend adopting structured, domain-specific metadata
standards, prioritizing FAIR-compliant repositories, and routinely applying
structured FAIR evaluation frameworks. These findings provide actionable
guidance to improve dataset interoperability and reuse, thereby accelerating
the clinical translation of voice biomarker technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer方法难以捕捉间歇性人声，需新模型准确分离人声。

Method: 利用Mamba2捕捉长时依赖，结合频带分割策略和双路径架构处理长输入序列。

Result: 超越现有模型，cSDR达11.03 dB，uSDR有显著提升，不同输入长度和人声模式下性能稳定。

Conclusion: Mamba模型用于高分辨率音频处理有效，为音频研究开辟新方向。

Abstract: We introduce a new music source separation model tailored for accurate vocal
isolation. Unlike Transformer-based approaches, which often fail to capture
intermittently occurring vocals, our model leverages Mamba2, a recent state
space model, to better capture long-range temporal dependencies. To handle long
input sequences efficiently, we combine a band-splitting strategy with a
dual-path architecture. Experiments show that our approach outperforms recent
state-of-the-art models, achieving a cSDR of 11.03 dB-the best reported to
date-and delivering substantial gains in uSDR. Moreover, the model exhibits
stable and consistent performance across varying input lengths and vocal
occurrence patterns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba-based
models for high-resolution audio processing and open up new directions for
broader applications in audio research.

Conclusion: 所提模型有效且有泛化能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in vision
and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling-covering
acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored.
Existing approach using sub-band-based encoders has achieved competitive
results but are limited by fixed input lengths, and the absence of explicit
frequency positional encoding. In this work, we propose a novel foundation
model that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with relative
frequency positional embeddings, enabling precise spectral localization across
arbitrary sampling configurations. The model supports inputs of arbitrary
length without padding or segmentation, producing a concise embedding that
retains both temporal and spectral fidelity. We evaluate our method on SIREN
(https://github.com/yucongzh/SIREN), a newly introduced large-scale benchmark
for machine signal encoding that unifies multiple datasets, including all DCASE
task 2 challenges (2020-2025) and widely-used industrial signal corpora.
Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in
anomaly detection and fault identification, confirming the effectiveness and
generalization capability of the proposed model. We open-sourced ECHO on

Motivation: 神经元脉冲可驱动肌肉使动物运动敏捷，但人工传感 - 运动系统中应用基于脉冲控制信号会导致学习崩溃，要找出使用脉冲的学习系统构建的参数范围以研究脉冲功能。

Method: 开发可改变传感器到运动连接中独立突触束数量的系统。

Result: 学习在运动神经元或独立突触束数量超临界值时崩溃；运动神经元数量少增加学习失败概率，若学习成功则学习更快；反向权重更新次数可定量解释结果。

Conclusion: 确定使用脉冲的学习系统构建的参数范围，有助于研究以往因学习困难难以触及的脉冲功能。

Abstract: Neuronal spikes directly drive muscles and endow animals with agile
movements, but applying the spike-based control signals to actuators in
artificial sensor-motor systems inevitably causes a collapse of learning. We
developed a system that can vary \emph{the number of independent synaptic
bundles} in sensor-to-motor connections. This paper demonstrates the following
four findings: (i) Learning collapses once the number of motor neurons or the
number of independent synaptic bundles exceeds a critical limit. (ii) The
probability of learning failure is increased by a smaller number of motor
neurons, while (iii) if learning succeeds, a smaller number of motor neurons
leads to faster learning. (iv) The number of weight updates that move in the
opposite direction of the optimal weight can quantitatively explain these
results. The functions of spikes remain largely unknown. Identifying the
parameter range in which learning systems using spikes can be constructed will
make it possible to study the functions of spikes that were previously
inaccessible due to the difficulty of learning.

Motivation: 现有脑机接口通道选择算法任务特定，新应用需重新优化，且高密度电极阵列存在交叉干扰和计算开销问题。

Method: 提出基于活动系数的通道选择方法ACCS，用通道活动系数CAC量化通道效用。

Result: 选前16个按CAC排名的通道，多分类准确率提升达34.97%。

Conclusion: ACCS能识别出与下游任务或模型无关的信息通道，适用于各种基于EEG的应用。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive,
low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher
spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the
development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of
channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and
computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often
employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically
task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work
proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based
Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity
Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By
selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97%
improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional
approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent
of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse
EEG-based applications.

Result: 经过对抗训练的深度对冲策略在样本外表现和对模型误设的恢复能力上始终优于经典策略。

Conclusion: 建立了一个在现实市场不确定性下进行稳健深度对冲的实用有效框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the robustness of classical deep hedging strategies
under distributional shifts by leveraging the concept of adversarial attacks.
We first demonstrate that standard deep hedging models are highly vulnerable to
small perturbations in the input distribution, resulting in significant
performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose an adversarial training
framework tailored to increase the robustness of deep hedging strategies. Our
approach extends pointwise adversarial attacks to the distributional setting
and introduces a computationally tractable reformulation of the adversarial
optimization problem over a Wasserstein ball. This enables the efficient
training of hedging strategies that are resilient to distributional
perturbations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that
adversarially trained deep hedging strategies consistently outperform their
classical counterparts in terms of out-of-sample performance and resilience to
model misspecification. Our findings establish a practical and effective
framework for robust deep hedging under realistic market uncertainties.

Result: 该方法对30%效应大小的基因组位点敏感，对10%不敏感，在额外实验中表现与基线条件一致。

Conclusion: 这项工作是朝着严格可推广地量化多级选择效应迈出的有希望的一步。

Abstract: Multilevel selection occurs when short-term individual-level reproductive
interests conflict with longer-term group-level fitness effects. Detecting and
quantifying this phenomenon is key to understanding evolution of traits ranging
from multicellularity to pathogen virulence. Multilevel selection is
particularly important in artificial life research due to its connection to
major evolutionary transitions, a hallmark of open-ended evolution. Bonetti
Franceschi & Volz (2024) proposed to detect multilevel selection dynamics by
screening for mutations that appear more often in a population than expected by
chance (due to individual-level fitness benefits) but are ultimately associated
with negative longer-term fitness outcomes (i.e., smaller, shorter-lived
descendant clades). Here, we use agent-based modeling with known ground truth
to assess the efficacy of this approach. To test these methods under
challenging conditions broadly comparable to the original dataset explored by
Bonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024), we use an epidemiological framework to model
multilevel selection in trade-offs between within-host growth rate and
between-host transmissibility. To achieve success on our in silico data, we
develop an alternate normalization procedure for identifying clade-level
fitness effects. We find the method to be sensitive in detecting genome sites
under multilevel selection with 30% effect sizes on fitness, but do not see
sensitivity to smaller 10% mutation effect sizes. To test the robustness of
this methodology, we conduct additional experiments incorporating extrinsic,
time-varying environmental changes and adaptive turnover in population
compositions, and find that screen performance remains generally consistent
with baseline conditions. This work represents a promising step towards
rigorous generalizable quantification of multilevel selection effects.

Motivation: 当前缺乏统一、可重复的工具包来拟合、比较和诊断过去一个世纪积累的众多PI公式，需要开发相关工具。

Method: 开发R包piCurve，包含广泛使用的PI公式库和一致的统计框架，支持MSE和MLE估计，通过信息矩阵进行不确定性量化，有自动数据初始化等。

Result: piCurve可对PI数据进行区域分类，其绘图和整理辅助工具简化了工作流程和报告。

Conclusion: piCurve的这些特性使可重复分析和公平的模型比较成为可能，包括对有光抑制的曲线。

Abstract: Photosynthesis-irradiance (PI) curves are foundational for quantifying
primary production, parameterizing ecosystem and biogeochemical models, and
interpreting physiological acclimation to light. Despite their broad use,
researchers lack a unified, reproducible toolkit to fit, compare, and diagnose
the many PI formulations that have accumulated over the last century. We
introduce piCurve, an R package that standardizes the modeling of PI
relationships, with a library of widely used light-limited, light-saturated,
and photoinhibited formulations and a consistent statistical framework for
estimation and comparison. With the total of 24 PI models, piCurve supports
mean squared error (MSE) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), provides
uncertainty quantification via information matrix (Hessian), and includes
automated, data-informed initialization to improve convergence. Utilities
classify PI data into light-limited, light-saturated, and photoinhibited
regions, while plotting and 'tidy' helpers streamline workflow and reporting.
Together, these features enable reproducible analyses and fair model
comparisons, including for curves exhibiting a plateau followed by
photoinhibition.

Motivation: PBT中人工调整生成器权重以达到理想输入分布很困难，过程繁琐且限制实际可实现的分布。

Method: 给定带未确定符号权重的生成器和目标函数，自动学习权重值优化目标；在支持微分和参数学习的离散概率编程系统Loaded Dice实现该方法。

Result: 能根据指定目标函数有效优化生成器分布；调优后的生成器在找bug速度上有3.1 - 7.4倍提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动离线调整生成器的方法有效，能提升生成器在PBT中的性能。

Abstract: Property-based testing validates software against an executable specification
by evaluating it on randomly generated inputs. The standard way that PBT users
generate test inputs is via generators that describe how to sample test inputs
through random choices. To achieve a good distribution over test inputs, users
must tune their generators, i.e., decide on the weights of these individual
random choices. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to understand how to choose
individual generator weights in order to achieve a desired distribution, so
today this process is tedious and limits the distributions that can be
practically achieved.
  In this paper, we develop techniques for the automatic and offline tuning of
generators. Given a generator with undetermined symbolic weights and an
objective function, our approach automatically learns values for these weights
that optimize for the objective. We describe useful objective functions that
allow users to (1) target desired distributions and (2) improve the diversity
and validity of their test cases. We have implemented our approach in a novel
discrete probabilistic programming system, Loaded Dice, that supports
differentiation and parameter learning, and use it as a language for
generators. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is effective at
optimizing generator distributions according to the specified objective
functions. We also perform a thorough evaluation on PBT benchmarks,
demonstrating that, when automatically tuned for diversity and validity, the
generators exhibit a 3.1-7.4x speedup in bug finding.

Motivation: 解决传统工程教育框架僵化、评估方法忽视学生个体需求，未充分采用在线和个性化教育创新的问题。

Method: 引入 PAPPL 平台，集成 ITS 核心组件，利用 GPT - 4o 模型，记录学生尝试、检测误解并生成针对性反馈，为教师提供分析。

Result: PAPPL 平台可根据学生学习情况动态调整，提供个性化帮助，教师可依据详细分析调整教学策略。

Conclusion: 本研究为各教育层次的生成式 ITS 发展提供基础框架，展现了个性化渐进学习和生成式 AI 在教育领域的潜力。

Abstract: Engineering education has historically been constrained by rigid,
standardized frameworks, often neglecting students' diverse learning needs and
interests. While significant advancements have been made in online and
personalized education within K-12 and foundational sciences, engineering
education at both undergraduate and graduate levels continues to lag in
adopting similar innovations. Traditional evaluation methods, such as exams and
homework assignments, frequently overlook individual student requirements,
impeding personalized educational experiences. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces the Personalized AI-Powered Progressive Learning (PAPPL)
platform, an advanced Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) designed specifically
for engineering education. It highlights the development of a scalable,
data-driven tutoring environment leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to
enhance personalized learning across diverse academic disciplines, particularly
in STEM fields. PAPPL integrates core ITS components including the expert
module, student module, tutor module, and user interface, and utilizes GPT-4o,
a sophisticated large language model (LLM), to deliver context-sensitive and
pedagogically sound hints based on students' interactions. The system uniquely
records student attempts, detects recurring misconceptions, and generates
progressively targeted feedback, providing personalized assistance that adapts
dynamically to each student's learning profile. Additionally, PAPPL offers
instructors detailed analytics, empowering evidence-based adjustments to
teaching strategies. This study provides a fundamental framework for the
progression of Generative ITSs scalable to all education levels, delivering
important perspectives on personalized progressive learning and the wider
possibilities of Generative AI in the field of education.

Conclusion: 该探索性研究推动了关于在非洲AI设计、使用和治理的社会现实中信任如何实际实施和体验的更多实证研究。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of AI is considered essential to the adoption and
application of AI systems. However, the meaning of trust varies across
industry, research and policy spaces. Studies suggest that professionals who
develop and use AI regard an AI system as trustworthy based on their personal
experiences and social relations at work. Studies about trust in AI and the
constructs that aim to operationalise trust in AI (e.g., consistency,
reliability, explainability and accountability). However, the majority of
existing studies about trust in AI are situated in Western, Educated,
Industrialised, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. The few studies about
trust and AI in Africa do not include the views of people who develop, study or
use AI in their work. In this study, we surveyed 157 people with professional
and/or educational interests in AI from 25 African countries, to explore how
they conceptualised trust in AI. Most respondents had links with workshops
about trust and AI in Africa in Namibia and Ghana. Respondents' educational
background, transnational mobility, and country of origin influenced their
concerns about AI systems. These factors also affected their levels of distrust
in certain AI applications and their emphasis on specific principles designed
to foster trust. Respondents often expressed that their values are guided by
the communities in which they grew up and emphasised communal relations over
individual freedoms. They described trust in many ways, including applying
nuances of Afro-relationalism to constructs in international discourse, such as
reliability and reliance. Thus, our exploratory study motivates more empirical
research about the ways trust is practically enacted and experienced in African
social realities of AI design, use and governance.

Through semi-structured interviews with practitioners, we collect an initial
set of 20 AI use cases. In addition, we co-design diagrams of the AI workflow
with the practitioners. We discuss the oversight mechanisms and guardrails used
in practice to safeguard AI use. The Fabric repository includes visual diagrams
of AI use cases and descriptions of the deployed systems. Using the repository,
we surface gaps in governance and find common patterns in human oversight of
deployed AI systems. We intend for Fabric to serve as an extendable, evolving
tool for researchers to study the effectiveness of AI governance.

TL;DR: 随着AI代理广泛部署，事故增多，现有报告流程不足，提出事故分析框架并给出信息保留与报告建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事故报告流程不足以理解AI代理事故，需要新的报告流程。

Method: 借鉴系统安全方法，提出三类致因因素，确定相关信息。

Result: 提出事故分析框架，确定相关信息，给出报告和信息保留建议。

Conclusion: 理解AI代理事故对风险管理至关重要。

Abstract: As AI agents become more widely deployed, we are likely to see an increasing
number of incidents: events involving AI agent use that directly or indirectly
cause harm. For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private
information or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such
incidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent
future occurrences. However, existing incident reporting processes are not
sufficient for understanding agent incidents. In particular, such processes are
largely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but
potentially sensitive, information such as an agent's chain of thought or
browser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting
processes, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on
systems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that
can cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual
(e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user
request). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which
factors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation
and access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide
recommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2)
what information developers and deployers should retain and make available to
incident investigators upon request. As we transition to a world with more
agents, understanding agent incidents will become increasingly crucial for
managing risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大语言模型中，在无法获取真实答案、模型权重和梯度受限的情况下，评估模型生成SQL查询的可靠性。

Method: 探究黑盒和白盒置信度估计策略，并在跨领域文本到SQL基准上评估其有效性。

Result: 基于一致性的黑盒模型表现更优，白盒中SQL语法感知方法在解释大语言模型对数几率时有优势，执行查询接地可提升两种方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 不同类型的置信度估计策略有各自优势，执行查询接地能作为有效补充。

Abstract: Confidence estimation for text-to-SQL aims to assess the reliability of
model-generated SQL queries without having access to gold answers. We study
this problem in the context of large language models (LLMs), where access to
model weights and gradients is often constrained. We explore both black-box and
white-box confidence estimation strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on
cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmarks. Our evaluation highlights the superior
performance of consistency-based methods among black-box models and the
advantage of SQL-syntax-aware approaches for interpreting LLM logits in
white-box settings. Furthermore, we show that execution-based grounding of
queries provides a valuable supplementary signal, improving the effectiveness
of both approaches.

Result: 微调含重复敏感数据使隐私泄露率从0 - 5%升至60 - 75%，平均增加64.2%；四种保护方法可将数据泄露降至0%，并保持94.7%的原始模型效用。

Conclusion: 提出的多层隐私保护框架及四种隐私保护方法能有效降低大语言模型微调时的数据泄露风险，同时较好地维持模型效用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to memorize
training data poses significant privacy risks, particularly during fine-tuning
processes. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of data
memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and introduces a novel multi-layered privacy
protection framework. Through controlled experiments on modern LLM
architectures including GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2, we demonstrate that
fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage rates from
baseline levels of 0-5% to 60-75%, representing a 64.2% average increase across
tested models. We propose and rigorously evaluate four complementary privacy
protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during
generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering. Our
experimental results show that these techniques can reduce data leakage to 0%
while maintaining 94.7% of original model utility.

Conclusion: SurveyGen - I能有效解决现有综述生成方法的局限性，有更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Survey papers play a critical role in scientific communication by
consolidating progress across a field. Recent advances in Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating key steps in the
survey-generation pipeline, such as retrieval, structuring, and summarization.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with maintaining
coherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive
citation coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an
automatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,
adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs
survey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and
then dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that
stores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across
subsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers
fine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I
leverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.
Experiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I
consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and
citation coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DLLMs部署时模型大、计算成本高问题，改善现有PTQ方法应用于DLLMs时的准确性和泛化性。

Method: 提出DLLMQuant框架，包含TMAS、IA - AQ、CGQ三种新技术。

Result: DLLMQuant取得显著性能提升，同时提高了效率。

Conclusion: DLLMQuant框架能有效解决DLLMs量化中的问题，提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by
large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization
(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language
Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced
generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a
16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key
mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -
clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation
and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding
steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;
2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during
iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps
progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,
making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To
address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,
which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling
(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with
the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware
Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's
interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)
Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token
scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight
quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves
significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.

Motivation: 连接大语言模型与形式知识表示和推理，解决大语言模型的缺点，且现有文本表示方法语义与句法和特定语言信息纠缠。

Method: 通过稀疏自编码器获取概念激活，对不同语言的激活值求平均得到概念平均值，再将其与本体类之间的真实映射进行关联。

Result: 概念平均值与单一语言相比，更能体现类之间的真实关系。

Conclusion: 该结果暗示了一种能更准确地对内部网络状态进行机械解释的新技术。

Abstract: Connecting LLMs with formal knowledge representation and reasoning is a
promising approach to address their shortcomings. Embeddings and sparse
autoencoders are widely used to represent textual content, but the semantics
are entangled with syntactic and language-specific information. We propose a
method that isolates concept semantics in Large Langue Models by averaging
concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text
representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French
and Chinese and then pass these texts as prompts to the Gemma 2B LLM. Using the
open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept
activations for each class and language version. We average the different
language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the
conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our
results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true
relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself.
The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of
internal network states with higher accuracy.

Method: 提出Finch - Zk黑盒框架，采用跨模型一致性检查策略揭示细粒度不准确，用针对性缓解技术修正问题部分。

Result: 在FELM数据集上，Finch - Zk的幻觉检测F1分数比现有方法提高6 - 39%；在GPQA - diamond数据集上，应用于先进模型时答案准确率提升7 - 8个百分点。

Conclusion: Finch - Zk为提高生产环境LLM系统的事实可靠性提供实用且可部署的保障。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating
content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present
Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model
consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without
requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations:
1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained
inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from
semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that
applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate
content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination
detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation,
Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy
on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama
4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models
demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for
enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

Motivation: 大语言模型在评估阅读材料与学生认知发展阶段的匹配度方面研究不足，尤其是中文教育场景，需填补此空白。

Method: 引入由60位特级教师标注的ZPD - SCA基准进行实验。

Result: 零样本学习场景下模型表现差，有上下文示例时性能大幅提升，但最佳模型也有偏差，不同体裁模型表现差异大。

Conclusion: 大语言模型有评估阅读难度的新兴能力，但当前训练有局限，ZPD - SCA可为认知对齐的教育应用评估和改进模型提供基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational
applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment
of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently
explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational
principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need
to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite
the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive
studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension
difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of
Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading
comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade
teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers
nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot
learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of
random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance
improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy
of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging
abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in
their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the
best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting
difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore,
significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore
the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for
evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

Result: 跨模型和游戏配置的大量实验表明评估指标有持续改善。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的提示是大语言模型校准的有效策略。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
decision-critical domains, it becomes essential to ensure that their confidence
estimates faithfully correspond to their actual correctness. Existing
calibration methods have primarily focused on post-hoc adjustments or auxiliary
model training; however, many of these approaches necessitate additional
supervision or parameter updates. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based
calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method
establishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based
on the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness. Through
feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance,
our framework dynamically improves model calibration. Extensive experiments
across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in
evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the potential of game-based prompting
as an effective strategy for LLM calibration. Code and data are available at

Conclusion: DEPTH 框架能有效解决大语言模型在关系抽取中的问题，降低幻觉率并提升性能。

Abstract: Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many
downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great
promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation
classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related
entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine
whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence
structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such
hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the
integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these
challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware
sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the
relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,
DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for
each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence
into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise
while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local
predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,
correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a
causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling
spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning
with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH
reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\%
improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 认知手术框架能有效提升LLMs在单文本范式下的自我识别能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of
self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was
generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is
reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model
is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,
performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm
(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although
this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been
systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to
confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under
IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a
phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent
ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which
remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we
propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main
modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship
discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP
scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%,
respectively.

Method: 基于Nemotron - H架构，用Mamba - 2层替换多数自注意力层，先预训练120亿参数模型，对齐后用Minitron策略压缩蒸馏。

Result: 相比同规模模型，在推理基准测试中准确率相当或更好，推理吞吐量最高达6倍。

Conclusion: 发布Nemotron - Nano - 9B - v2等模型检查点和多数训练数据集。

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model
designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models.
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the
majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture
are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when
generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model
(Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe.
After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to
compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to
128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision).
Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks
while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like
8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2,
Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with
the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

Abstract: In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is
propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by
examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which
previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using
intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for
preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2,
DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for
GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while
this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond
punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g.,
subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static
summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to
changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we
investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by
LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping
experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal
quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new
insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs
and have implications for interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出无训练方法DPad优化基于扩散的大语言模型文本生成，减少计算开销，在多基准测试中加速显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的大语言模型存在高计算开销问题，预测大量未来后缀标记但仅保留小部分。

Method: 提出DPad方法，整合滑动窗口和距离衰减丢弃策略，限制注意力到附近后缀标记。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DPad比普通dLLMs实现了最高61.4倍的加速，同时保持相当的准确性。

Conclusion: DPad具有高效和可扩展的长序列推理潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by
framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational
overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while
retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a
training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix
tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two
strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window,
and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix
tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with
existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only
a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on
LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to
$\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable
accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence
inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

Result: ShizhenGPT优于可比规模模型，在中医视觉理解方面领先，能实现跨模态统一感知。

Conclusion: ShizhenGPT为中医多模态感知和诊断奠定基础，有望启发该领域进一步探索。

Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their
potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored
due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2)
the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking,
listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond
the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present
ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data
scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text
and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and
physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to
achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect
recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for
Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that
ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger
proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among
existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities
like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal
perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly
available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

Conclusion: LMTransplant是一种有效的文本增强范式，能充分利用大语言模型知识生成多样变体，有良好性能和扩展性。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional
methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing,
which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large
language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge
emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs
remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper,
we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs.
The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed
text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant
based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more
diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge
embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We
evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its
superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover,
LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data
grows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual
contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment
across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation
framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates
synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a
typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control
over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and
mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does
not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that
translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We
validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and
cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated
pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current
LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever
for improving multilingual robustness. Code available at:

Motivation: 解决神经手语生成中因训练数据里手语者形态和风格多样导致的符号类内变异大的问题，提高模型鲁棒性。

Method: 一是用四元数空间的骨骼旋转编码姿势并使用测地损失训练；二是引入对比损失，通过语义相似度构建解码器嵌入。

Result: 对比损失使正确关键点概率比基线提升16%，结合四元数姿势编码使平均骨角误差降低6%。

Conclusion: 在基于Transformer的手语生成模型训练中融入骨骼结构建模和语义引导对比目标有益。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in
the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and
stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such
variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive
Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses
using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to
improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we
introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic
similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,
aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey
relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss
alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT
baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves
a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of
incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive
objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based
SLP models.

Conclusion: TransLLM具有强泛化性和跨任务适应性。

Abstract: Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple
tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand
prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and
data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while
large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural
language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical
reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose
TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal
modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our
approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex
dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph
attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured
embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via
reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input
characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework
operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,
dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and
projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to
generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three
tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised
and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers
competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing
strong generalization and cross-task adaptability. Our code is available at

Method: 提出三个可跨医疗系统复制的临床任务，用实际住院患者病历测试三个最先进大语言模型，采用针对性文本检索或最新临床记录。

Result: RAG性能与使用最新记录相近或更优，接近使用模型完整上下文性能，且所需输入令牌大幅减少。

Conclusion: 即使新模型能处理更长文本，RAG仍是有竞争力且高效的方法。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing
a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language
models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this
unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even
state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages
from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input
tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable
across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)
generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using
EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs
with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval
or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds
the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using
the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our
results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as
newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

Abstract: Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked
impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the
reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct
translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen
2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT
generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments
reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot
language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves
performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and
proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning
remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but
does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune
using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third,
data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully
curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier
corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results
clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated
datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a
promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language
generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding
strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains
challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.
While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted
technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing
diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of
activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that
dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit
quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority
of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model
variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,
quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this
multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization
behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide
a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and
experimental setups will be released to support the community.
