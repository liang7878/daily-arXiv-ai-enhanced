In this paper, we present a comprehensive\nevaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,\npre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time\ncomputation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.\nThrough extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate\nthat, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve\nperformance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify\nwhich techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons\nfor the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for\nautonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and\nachieve competitive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u9002\u914d\u540e\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u5173\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5728Waymo Sim Agents\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u9002\u914d\u540e\u6a21\u5757\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u6280\u672f\u3001\u5206\u6790\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u53ca\u6240\u9700\u9002\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728Sim Agents\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Top-of-the-line LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,\nClaude Sonnet) operate with high accuracy but are prohibitively expensive when\nprocessing many records. To avoid high costs, more affordable but lower quality\nLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku) can be used to process records, but we\nneed to ensure that the overall accuracy does not deviate substantially from\nthat of the top-of-the-line LLMs. The model cascade framework provides a\nblueprint to manage this trade-off, by using the confidence of LLMs in their\noutput (e.g., log-probabilities) to decide on which records to use the\naffordable LLM.

Experimental results across 8 real-world\ndatasets show that BARGAIN reduces cost, on average, by up to 86% more than\nstate-of-the-art, while providing stronger theoretical guarantees on accuracy\nof output, with similar gains when guaranteeing a desired level of precision or\nrecall.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBARGAIN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6210\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u9876\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7ea7\u8054\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7701\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5f31\u3002", "method": "BARGAIN\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u7edf\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cBARGAIN\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5e73\u5747\u591a\u964d\u4f4e86%\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6216\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u65f6\u4e5f\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "BARGAIN\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6216\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address\nsparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards,\nas well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of\nstates and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with\ngeneration uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between\nadjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss\nof ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a\nhighly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal\nauto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed\nCBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random\nvariable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the\ngoal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated\nsequences' dynamic legitimacy.

An Empirical Study on Prompting LLMs to Detect Design Principle Violations", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI"], "comment": "Accepted to ASE2025", "summary": "Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws,\nsuch as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong\nunderstanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles. Existing\nsolutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific\nprogramming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across\nall five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new\napproach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess\nLLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We\npresent a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,\nand GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID\nprinciples. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240\nmanually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct\nprompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and\nchain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection\naccuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with\nGPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with\nchallenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a\ndramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a\ndeliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE\nprompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection\naccuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply\nwith increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that\neffective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a\ntailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific\ndesign context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability\nthrough AI-assisted code analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2dSOLID\u539f\u5219\u8fdd\u53cd\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u5168\u90e8\u4e94\u4e2aSOLID\u539f\u5219\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08CodeLlama\u3001DeepSeekCoder\u3001QwenCoder\u548cGPT - 4o Mini\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2dSOLID\u539f\u5219\u8fdd\u53cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u542b240\u4e2a\u624b\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee3\u7801\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u660e\u663e\u5c42\u6b21\uff0cGPT - 4o Mini\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u4f46\u5904\u7406DIP\u539f\u5219\u4ecd\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u65e0\u901a\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5339\u914d\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728AI\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This study assesses the Across-the-Curve Credit\nSpread Index (AXI) -- a transparent, transaction-based measure of wholesale\nbank funding costs -- as a complement to SOFR, summarizing its behavior,\nconstruction, and loan-pricing implications. AXI aggregates observable\nunsecured funding transactions across short- and long-term maturities to\nproduce a daily credit spread that is IOSCO-aligned and operationally\ncompatible with SOFR-based infrastructure. The Financial Conditions Credit\nSpread Index (FXI) is a broader market companion to AXI and serves as its\nfallback. FXI co-moves closely with AXI in normal times; under stress, the\ncorrelation of daily changes exceeds 0.9 for economy-wide shocks and remains\nstrong in bank-specific stress, around 0.8 during the Silicon Valley Bank\nepisode. Empirically, AXI is strongly correlated with standard credit-spread\nmeasures and market-stress indicators and is inversely related to\nfinancial-sector performance. SOFR+AXI exhibits correlations with macroeconomic\nvariables with the signs and magnitudes expected of a credit-sensitive rate.

First, the Turnbull nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator\n(NPMLE) via the EM algorithm recovers the survival distribution without strong\nassumptions. Second, Weibull and log-normal accelerated failure time (AFT)\nmodels with interval likelihoods provide smooth, covariate-adjusted survival\ncurves and interpretable time-ratio effects.

In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and\nits strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based\non three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation\nintensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.\nWe demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased\nrandom selection mechanism.

Our algorithm processes the graph in\n$O(\\log n)$ independent layers and partitions incident edges into prefix-based\nclasses where each class maintains a 1-sparse triple over a prime field.\nPotential witnesses are surfaced by pair-key (PK) alignment, and every\ncandidate is verified by a three-stage, zero-false-positive pipeline: a\nclass-level 1-sparse consistency check, two slot-level decodings, and a final\nadjacency confirmation. \\textbf{To obtain single-run high-probability coverage,\nwe further instantiate $R=c_G\\log n$ independent PK groups per class (each\nprobing a constant number of complementary buckets), which amplifies the\nper-layer hit rate from $\\Theta(1/\\log n)$ to $1-n^{-\\Omega(1)}$ without\nchanging the accounting.} A one-shot pairing discipline and class-term\ntriggering yield a per-(layer,level) accounting bound of $O(m)$, while\nkeep-coin concentration ensures that each vertex retains only $O(d^+(x))$ keys\nwith high probability. Consequently, the total running time is $O(m\\log^2 n)$\nand the peak space is $O(m\\log n)$, both with high probability. The algorithm\nemits a succinct Seeds+Logs artifact that enables a third party to replay all\nnecessary checks and certify a NO-instance in $\\tilde O(m\\log n)$ time. We also\nprove a $\\Theta(1/\\log n)$ hit-rate lower bound for any single PK family under\na constant-probe local model (via Yao)--motivating the use of $\\Theta(\\log n)$\nindependent groups--and discuss why global algebraic convolutions would break\nnear-linear accounting or run into fine-grained barriers.

First,\nwe find that serverless systems exhibit significant computational overhead due\nto instance churn equivalent to 10-40% of the CPU cycles spent on request\nhandling, primarily originating from worker nodes. Second, we observe high\nmemory allocation due to scaling policy: 2-10 times more than actively used.\nFinally, we demonstrate that reducing these overheads typically results in\nsignificant performance degradation in the current systems, underscoring the\nneed for new, cost-efficient autoscaling strategies.

While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that\nunder certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which\nwe refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the\nstate-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal\nactions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)\nthe variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to\nzero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations\ncollapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed\nthose aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since\nthe collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise\nangles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:\ncan we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target\nconfiguration in the action selection layer?

Although prior research\nshows that higher limits increase average spending, scalar-based outcomes\nobscure the heterogeneous distributional nature of consumer responses. This\npaper addresses this gap by proposing a new causal inference framework that\nestimates how continuous changes in the credit limit affect the entire\ndistribution of consumer spending. We formalize distributional causal effects\nwithin the Wasserstein space and introduce a robust Distributional Double\nMachine Learning estimator, supported by asymptotic theory to ensure\nconsistency and validity. To implement this estimator, we design a deep\nlearning architecture comprising two components: a Neural Functional Regression\nNet to capture complex, nonlinear relationships between treatments, covariates,\nand distributional outcomes, and a Conditional Normalizing Flow Net to estimate\ngeneralized propensity scores under continuous treatment.

In particular, we enhance the hierarchical navigable small world\n(HNSW) graph to index tensors, and only store additional deltas for tensors\nwithin a predefined similarity threshold to ensure tensor-level deduplication.\nSecond, we propose a delta quantization algorithm that effectively compresses\ndelta tensors, thus achieving a superior compression ratio with controllable\nmodel accuracy loss. Finally, we devise a compression-aware model loading\nmechanism, which improves model utilization performance by enabling direct\ncomputation on compressed tensors.

Moreover, existing MoE architectures\ntypically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,\nresulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we\nfirst demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint\nbut do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized\nframeworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free\noptimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per\nlayer in a pretrained MoE model.

Although it is\nrelatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping\nof inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely\nunexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may\nfocus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that\nbelong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an\nexplicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named\nTopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features\nthat characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the\nspecific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain\ninput embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might\nrequire specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a\nmeaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel\nway to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering\ntechniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human\nevaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based\non the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically\nselect the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are\nproduced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation\nresults show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and\nmeaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using\nmutation analysis.

For $\\pi$-stationary $P$ in which $\\pi$ is invariant with\nrespect to $G$, we show that in general $P_{da}$ enjoys favorable convergence\nproperties than $P$ based on metrics such as spectral gap or asymptotic\nvariance, and within the family of $P_{da}$ the most preferable kernel is in\ngeneral $(P_{la})_{ra}$. We demonstrate that $P_{la}, P_{ra}, (P_{la})_{ra}$\nare comparable in terms of mixing times, which supports the use of $P_{la},\nP_{ra}$ in practice as computationally cheaper alternatives over\n$(P_{la})_{ra}$. These averaged kernels also admit natural geometric\ninterpretations: they emerge as unique projections of $P$ onto specific\n$G$-invariant structures under the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the\nHilbert-Schmidt norm and satisfy Pythagorean identities. On the other hand, in\nthe general case if $\\pi$ is not invariant with respect to $G$, we propose and\nstudy a technique that we call state-dependent averaging of Markov kernels\nwhich generalizes the earlier results to this setting. As examples and\napplications, this averaging perspective not only allows us to recast\nstate-of-the-art Markov chain samplers such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or\npiecewise-deterministic Markov processes as specific cases of $P_{da}$, but\nalso enables improvements to existing samplers such as Metropolis-Hastings,\nachieving rapid mixing in some toy models or when $\\pi$ is the discrete uniform\ndistribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Unfortunately, these two assumptions are rarely met in\npractice. To fully avoid these two conditions, we develop a so-called\ncalibration PI (cPI) which leverages estimations by Deep Neural Networks (DNN)\nor kernel methods. Moreover, the cPI can be easily adjusted to capture the\nestimation variability within the prediction procedure, which is a crucial\nerror source often ignored in practice.

During training,\nconverting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,\nquantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and\ncost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that\nquantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD\ncompared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in\nDP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately\nlarge accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a\ndynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of\nlayers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that\neffectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the\nlayers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware\nlayer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity\nestimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model\nquality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy\nbudget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,\nand DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant\nconsistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near\nPareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical\nthroughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in\nvalidation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u91cf\u5316\u5728DP - SGD\u4e2d\u6bd4\u666e\u901aSGD\u9020\u6210\u66f4\u5927\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6QPQuant\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728DP - SGD\u4e2d\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQPQuant\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u7684\u6982\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u635f\u5931\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cDPQuant\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6 - \u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53472.21\u500d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5c0f\u4e8e2%\u3002", "conclusion": "QPQuant\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3DP - SGD\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8f83\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Traditional control systems, which are human\nand optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving\ncontext, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control\nstrategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning\nframework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture\nconsists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual\npower lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information\nwithin the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and\nenhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and\npotential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized\napproaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global\nobservations, this method also decomposes the observation space.

This has been\ndiscussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and\nmutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be\nwritten as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs\nand its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the\nidempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the\nLLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been\nlimited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two\nhypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to\nrecover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending\ntherefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.\nEspecially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the\nconstraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple\nhypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio\ntransformed likelihood function.

ML work introduces\npredictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational\naccuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains\nfragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems\nassess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak\nlinkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS\nframework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining\nrules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;\n(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and\ntelehealth workflows.

Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control\nparadigms are ``choose phase\" and ``switch\" strategies. Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,\nthe switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next\npredefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a\nmore predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase\nallocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while\nothers are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep\nHierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle\nduration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the\ntotal cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions\nbased on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the\nallocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn\nmovements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements.

Unbounded\nmaximisation is problematic for many reasons. We wanted to verify whether these\nRL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well. Turns\nout, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the\nLLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various\nscenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically\nresemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring\nhomeostatic targets and \"defaulting\" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It\nis equally concerning that the \"default\" meant also reverting back to\nsingle-objective optimisation. Our findings also suggest that long-running\nscenarios are important. Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially\nsuccessful behaviour.

(ii)\nThe second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function\nin y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the\nobjective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting\na further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y\nfails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is\nto backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.\n(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for\ns, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this\nway, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without\nhaving to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information\nbetween the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the\nfirst one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the\nliterature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options\nfrom that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple\ndatasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u524d\u4e24\u79cd\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u4e24\u79cd\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u63a2\u7d22\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u540e\u4e24\u79cd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u9009\u9879\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u9009\u9879\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u9879\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

We argue\nthat this gap reflects paradigmatic lock-in that channels AI into incremental\noptimization rather than structural transformation. Using a cross-case\nanalysis, we propose a 2x2 framework that reconceptualizes AI strategy along\ntwo independent dimensions: the degree of transformation achieved (incremental\nto transformational) and the treatment of human contribution (reduced to\namplified). The framework surfaces four patterns now dominant in practice:\nindividual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and a less\ndeployed frontier of collaborative intelligence. Evidence shows that the first\nthree reinforce legacy work models and yield localized gains without durable\nvalue capture. Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms:\ncomplementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution\n(mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human\ndetermination of ethical and strategic parameters).

This paper\nintroduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding\nagent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We\nformulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are\nrepresented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and\niteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)\nand evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate\nthat the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average\ndelay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and\nincremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting\ncycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green\nallocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.\nThis work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design\nin traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation\nengineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdEvolveSignal\uff0c\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8eWebster\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u91cd\u5b9a\u65f6\uff0c\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ed3\u679c\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5019\u9009\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u7684Python\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8eWebster\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8bef\u964d\u4f4e20.1%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u505c\u8f66\u6b21\u6570\u964d\u4f4e47.1%\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528AI\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u4ea4\u901a\u5de5\u7a0b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We further train statistical classifiers to\npredict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus\nnarrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying\nspecific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and\npredictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery.

Our findings indicate that the\nGlorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in\nparameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest\nperformance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.\nAll code and data accompanying this manuscript are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/srigas/KAN_Initialization_Schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6837\u6761KANs\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Glorot\u542f\u53d1\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4e30\u5bcc\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u5e42\u5f8b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6574\u4f53\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "KANs\u867d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u6837\u6761KANs\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7LeCun\u548cGlorot\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e26\u53ef\u8c03\u6307\u6570\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5e42\u5f8b\u65cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\u3001NTK\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548cFeynman\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b50\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Glorot\u542f\u53d1\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4e30\u5bcc\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e42\u5f8b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5728\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e42\u5f8b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6837\u6761KANs\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}

To address\nperformance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote\nsensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes\nstrategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a\nglobal crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries\nacross five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,\nsoybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,\nCropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,\nand cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal\nmulti-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic\ncoefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization\nunder spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and\nrobust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal\ndata augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that\nsimulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median\ntemporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance\nacross all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,\nparticularly when training data diversity is limited.

Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through\ninstruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may\nsignificantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational\nresources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue\nthat knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable\nfor fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to\nfingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.\nDespite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being\noverwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale\nfine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning\n(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the\nfingerprint subspace.

While hallucinations-unintentional\nfalsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM\nknowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior\nof LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical\nscenarios.

The widespread use of\nopen-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the\nseverity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and\ndetection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially\nproblematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.\nIn this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military\nobject detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To\nsupport this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military\nvehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors\nfor poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:\na patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a\npositive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion\nof the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical\napplicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized\npoisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual\nindustrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of\nmethods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a\nsimple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows\npromising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the\nreconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while\nbeing less time- and memory-intensive.

The emergency\ndepartment (ED) is marked by higher rates of stress that lead to clinicians\nrelying more on implicit biases during decision making. In this work, we\nconsidered a large cohort of psychiatric patients in the ED from the Mount\nSinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City to investigate the effects of\nclinician bias on SCZ diagnosis while controlling for known risk factors and\npatient sociodemographic information. Clinician bias was quantified as the\nratio of negative to total sentences within a patient's first ED note. We\nutilized a logistic regression to predict SCZ diagnosis given patient race,\nsex, age, history of trauma or substance use disorder, and the ratio of\nnegative sentences. Our findings showed that an increased ratio of negative\nsentences is associated with higher odds of obtaining a SCZ diagnosis [OR (95%\nCI)=1.408 (1.361-1.456)]. Identifying as male [OR (95% CI)=1.112 (1.055-1.173)]\nor Black [OR (95% CI)=1.081(1.031-1.133)] increased one's odds of being\ndiagnosed with SCZ. However, from an intersectional lens, Black female patients\nwith high SES have the highest odds of obtaining a SCZ diagnosis [OR (95%\nCI)=1.629 (1.535-1.729)]. Results such as these suggest that SES does not act\nas a protective buffer against SCZ diagnosis in all patients, demanding more\nattention to the quantification of health disparities. Lastly, we demonstrated\nthat clinician bias is operational with real world data and related to\nincreased odds of obtaining a stigmatizing diagnosis such as SCZ.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7f8e\u56fd\u6025\u8bca\u79d1\u7cbe\u795e\u79d1\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u7b49\u4e0e\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9ad8\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u5e76\u975e\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u8005\u6709\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u504f\u89c1\u5bf9\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u7f8e\u56fd\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u53d6\u7ebd\u7ea6\u897f\u5948\u5c71\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u6025\u8bca\u79d1\u5927\u91cf\u7cbe\u795e\u79d1\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u504f\u89c1\u91cf\u5316\u4e3a\u60a3\u8005\u9996\u4efd\u6025\u8bca\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u8d1f\u9762\u8bed\u53e5\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u8d1f\u9762\u8bed\u53e5\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u7537\u6027\u3001\u9ed1\u4eba\u88ab\u8bca\u65ad\u4e3a\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u51e0\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9ad8\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u9ed1\u4eba\u5973\u6027\u60a3\u8005\u88ab\u8bca\u65ad\u51e0\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u5e76\u975e\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0a\u6709\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5065\u5eb7\u5dee\u5f02\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u504f\u89c1\u4e0e\u589e\u52a0\u83b7\u5f97\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u51e0\u7387\u6709\u5173\u3002"}}

Secondly, to address this shortcoming, we propose an\nalternate framework, Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP), that\njointly accounts for user data and privacy preference. We show that AHDP is\nrobust to possible correlations between data and privacy. Thirdly, we formalize\nthe guarantees of the proposed AHDP framework through an operational hypothesis\ntesting perspective. The hypothesis testing setup may be of independent\ninterest in analyzing other privacy frameworks as well.

Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation.

Extensive experiments on XCAD and DCA1 datasets demonstrate that\nour approach outperforms the dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity and IoU\ncompared to other models in comparative evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u81ea\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u75be\u75c5\u9700\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u8017\u65f6\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6709\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u524d\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u81ea\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u635f\u5931\u548c\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u81ea\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u677e\u6563\u7ea6\u675f\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728XCAD\u548cDCA1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ab0\u5b50\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u4ea4\u5e76\u6bd4\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u81ea\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations.

A particularly notable approach for\ndata-driven regularization is to use learned image denoisers as implicit priors\nin iterative image reconstruction algorithms. This survey presents a\ncomprehensive overview of this powerful and emerging class of algorithms,\ncommonly referred to as plug-and-play (PnP) methods. We begin by providing a\nbrief background on image denoising and inverse problems, followed by a short\nreview of traditional regularization strategies. We then explore how proximal\nsplitting algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM) and proximal gradient descent (PGD), can naturally accommodate learned\ndenoisers in place of proximal operators, and under what conditions such\nreplacements preserve convergence. The role of Tweedie's formula in connecting\noptimal Gaussian denoisers and score estimation is discussed, which lays the\nfoundation for regularization-by-denoising (RED) and more recent\ndiffusion-based posterior sampling methods. We discuss theoretical advances\nregarding the convergence of PnP algorithms, both within the RED and proximal\nsettings, emphasizing the structural assumptions that the denoiser must satisfy\nfor convergence, such as non-expansiveness, Lipschitz continuity, and local\nhomogeneity. We also address practical considerations in algorithm design,\nincluding choices of denoiser architecture and acceleration strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\uff08PnP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6210\u50cf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u6210\u50cf\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0cPnP\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u65b0\u5174\u6709\u529b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u4ecb\u7ecd\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u80cc\u666f\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u518d\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd1\u7aef\u5206\u88c2\u7b97\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u5f15\u5165\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u53ca\u6536\u655b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bbaTweedie\u516c\u5f0f\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790PnP\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u53ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9645\u8003\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u68b3\u7406\u4e86PnP\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6761\u4ef6\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9PnP\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

To expedite such studies, this work\nleverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF\nsolutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models\nthat run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to\naccomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first\ncontribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear\nleast-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it\nusing a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is\nto feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the\nresultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third\ncontribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF\nquantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network.\nPreliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain\nenhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much\nfewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for\naddressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u4ea4\u6d41\u6f6e\u6d41\uff08AC PF\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793aVQC\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u7f51\u4efb\u52a1\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e92\u8054\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5927\u91cfAC PF\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u5355\u4e2aAC PF\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aVQC\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7ecf\u5178/\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b2. \u5c06PF\u89c4\u683c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5d4c\u5165VQC\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u901a\u7528PF\u89e3\uff1b3. \u5f00\u53d1\u5229\u7528\u7535\u7f51\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u9ad8\u6548\u6d4b\u91cfAC - PF\u91cf\u5b50\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u6570\u503c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684VQC\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u91cf\u5b50AC - PF\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u4efb\u52a1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
