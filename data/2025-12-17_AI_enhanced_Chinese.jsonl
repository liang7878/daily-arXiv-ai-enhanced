Traditional event data models, also called case-centric, are unable to cope with the complexity introduced by these more refined relationships. Several models have been made to move from case-centric to Object-Centric Event Data (OCED), trying to retain simplicity as much as possible. Still, these suffer from inherent ambiguities, and lack a comprehensive support of essential dimensions related to time and (dynamic) relations. In this work, we propose to fill this gap by leveraging a well-founded ontology of events and bringing ontological foundations to OCED, with a three-step approach. First, we start from key open issues reported in the literature regarding current OCED metamodels, and witness their ambiguity and expressiveness limitations on illustrative and representative examples proposed therein. Second, we consider the OCED Core Model, currently proposed as the basis for defining a new standard for object-centric event data, and we enhance it by grounding it on a lightweight version of UFO-B called gUFO, a well-known foundational ontology tailored to the representation of objects, events, time, and their (dynamic) relations. This results in a new metamodel, which we call gOCED. The third contribution then shows how gOCED at once covers the features of existing metamodels preserving their simplicity, and extends them with the essential features needed to overcome the ambiguity and expressiveness issues reported in the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e09\u6b65\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e(OCED)\u5f15\u5165\u672c\u4f53\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709OCED\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709OCED\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5168\u9762\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709OCED\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b65\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684gUFO\u589e\u5f3aOCED\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u5143\u6a21\u578bgOCED\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u6b65\u5c55\u793agOCED\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u73b0\u6709\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5143\u6a21\u578bgOCED\u3002", "conclusion": "gOCED\u65e2\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u5177\u5907\u514b\u670d\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u95ee\u9898\u6240\u9700\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

However, efficient task offloading and resource allocation for time-critical applications in VEC remain challenging due to constrained network bandwidth and computational resources, stringent task deadlines, and rapidly changing network conditions. To address these challenges, we formulate a Deadline-Constrained Task Offloading and Resource Allocation Problem (DOAP), denoted as $\\mathbf{P}$, in VEC with both bandwidth and computational resource constraints, aiming to maximize the total vehicle utility. To solve $\\mathbf{P}$, we propose $\\mathtt{SARound}$, an approximation algorithm based on Linear Program rounding and local-ratio techniques, that improves the best-known approximation ratio for DOAP from $\\frac{1}{6}$ to $\\frac{1}{4}$. Additionally, we design an online service subscription and offloading control framework to address the challenges of short task deadlines and rapidly changing wireless network conditions. To validate our approach, we develop a comprehensive VEC simulator, VecSim, using the open-source simulation libraries OMNeT++ and Simu5G. VecSim integrates our designed framework to manage the full life-cycle of real-time vehicular tasks.

The $b$-coloring problem, in which the task is to decide whether a graph admits a $b$-coloring with $k$ colors, is NP-complete in general but polytime solvable on trees. Moreover, it is known that $b$-coloring is in XP but W[$t$]-hard for all $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ when parameterized by tree-width. In fact, only very few parameters, such as the vertex cover number, were known to admit an FPT algorithm for $b$-coloring. In this paper, we consider a more restrictive parameter measuring similarity to trees than tree-width, namely the feedback edge number, and show that $b$-coloring is fixed-parameter tractable under this parameterization.

These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation.

This conflict has created a reviewer roulette and anonymous tribunal model - a zero-cost attack system - characterized by high-stakes subjectivity, turf wars, and the arbitrary rejection of sound research (the equivalence class problem). We propose the Impact Market (IM), a novel three-phase system that decouples publication from prestige. Phase 1 (Publication): All sound and rigorous papers are accepted via a PC review, solving the \"equivalence class\" problem. Phase 2 (Investment): An immediate, scarce prestige signal is created via a futures market. Senior community members invest tokens into published papers, creating a transparent, crowdsourced Net Invested Score (NIS). Phase 3 (Calibration): A 3-year lookback mechanism validates these investments against a manipulation-resistant Multi-Vector Impact Score (MVIS). This MVIS adjusts each investor's future influence (their Investor Rating), imposing a quantifiable cost on bad actors and rewarding accurate speculation. The IM model replaces a hidden, zero-cost attack system with a transparent, accountable, and data-driven market that aligns immediate credentialing with long-term, validated impact. Agent-based simulations demonstrate that while a passive market matches current protocols in low-skill environments, introducing investor agency and conviction betting increases the retrieval of high-impact papers from 28% to over 85% under identical conditions, confirming that incentivized self-selection is the mechanism required to scale peer review.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9876\u7ea7\u5b66\u672f\u4f1a\u8bae\u9762\u4e34\u4f20\u64ad\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u63d0\u4f9b\u58f0\u671b\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51faImpact Market\uff08IM\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8bba\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9876\u7ea7\u5b66\u672f\u4f1a\u8bae\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u4f20\u64ad\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a00\u7f3a\u58f0\u671b\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f0a\u7aef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7PC\u8bc4\u5ba1\u63a5\u53d7\u6240\u6709\u5408\u7406\u4e25\u8c28\u8bba\u6587\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u671f\u8d27\u5e02\u573a\u521b\u5efa\u58f0\u671b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7531\u8d44\u6df1\u6210\u5458\u6295\u8d44\uff1b\u4e09\u5e74\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u672a\u6765\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6295\u6ce8\u540e\uff0c\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8bba\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u7387\u4ece28%\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u8d8585%\u3002", "conclusion": "IM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u53d6\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u6269\u5927\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u89c4\u6a21\u6240\u9700\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Through 26 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from different application domains and with varied backgrounds across 23 countries, we conducted research on fairness requirements in AI from software engineering perspective. Our study assesses the participants' awareness of fairness in AI / ML software and its application within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from translating fairness concerns into requirements to assessing their arising early in the SDLC. It also examines fairness through the key assessment dimensions of implementation, validation, evaluation, and how it is balanced with trade-offs involving other priorities, such as addressing all the software functionalities and meeting critical delivery deadlines. Findings of our thematic qualitative analysis show that while our participants recognize the aforementioned AI fairness dimensions, practices are inconsistent, and fairness is often deprioritized with noticeable knowledge gaps.

While permutation-based methods are a standard tool for this task, classical implementations rely on repeated random permutations, introducing computational overhead and stochastic instability. In this paper, we show that by replacing multiple random permutations with a single, deterministic, and optimal permutation, we achieve a method that retains the core principles of permutation-based importance while being non-random, faster, and more stable. We validate this approach across nearly 200 scenarios, including real-world household finance and credit risk applications, demonstrating improved bias-variance tradeoffs and accuracy in challenging regimes such as small sample sizes, high dimensionality, and low signal-to-noise ratios. Finally, we introduce Systemic Variable Importance, a natural extension designed for model stress-testing that explicitly accounts for feature correlations. This framework provides a transparent way to quantify how shocks or perturbations propagate through correlated inputs, revealing dependencies that standard variable importance measures miss.

This decentralization is achieved through the implementation of microservice architectures, which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA) such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure SLA compliance. This is achieved by sophisticated orchestration strategies such as Kubernetes, which help facilitate resource management. The orchestration strategies alone do not guarantee SLA adherence due to the inherent delay of scaling resources. Existing auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to address these challenges, but they suffer from performance issues and configuration complexity. In this paper, a novel auto-scaling algorithm is proposed for SLA-constrained edge computing applications. This approach combines a Machine Learning (ML) based proactive auto-scaling algorithm, capable of predicting incoming resource requests to forecast demand, with a reactive autoscaler which considers current resource utilization and SLA constraints for immediate adjustments. The algorithm is integrated into Kubernetes as an extension, and its performance is evaluated through extensive experiments in an edge environment with real applications.

Recent reasoningenhanced methods have shown promise by introducing deliberate, chain-of-thought-like processes with intermediate reasoning steps. However, these methods rely solely on the next target item as supervision, leading to two critical issues: (1) reasoning instability--the process becomes overly sensitive to recent behaviors and spurious interactions like accidental clicks, and (2) surface-level reasoning--the model memorizes item-to-item transitions rather than understanding intrinsic behavior patterns. To address these challenges, we propose IGR-SR, an Intent-Guided Reasoning framework for Sequential Recommendation that anchors the reasoning process to explicitly extracted high-level intents. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Latent Intent Distiller (LID) that efficiently extracts multi-faceted intents using a frozen encoder with learnable tokens, (2) an Intent-aware Deliberative Reasoner (IDR) that decouples reasoning into intent deliberation and decision-making via a dual-attention architecture, and (3) an Intent Consistency Regularization (ICR) that ensures robustness by enforcing consistent representations across different intent views. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that IGR-SR achieves an average 7.13% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Critically, under 20% behavioral noise, IGR-SR degrades only 10.4% compared to 16.2% and 18.6% for competing methods, validating the effectiveness and robustness of intent-guided reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u8868\u9762\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faIGR - SR\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4ee5\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u54c1\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u8868\u9762\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIGR - SR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6f5c\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff08LID\uff09\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u5668\uff08IDR\uff09\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08ICR\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cIGR - SR\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53477.13%\uff1b\u572820%\u884c\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u5e45\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u610f\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\uff0cIGR - SR\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories.

In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) appear to mix all processing, because modular solutions are difficult to find as they are vanishing subspaces in the space of possible solutions. Here, we draw inspiration from fault-tolerant computation and the Poisson-like firing of real neurons to show that activity-dependent neural noise, combined with nonlinear neural responses, drives the emergence of solutions that reflect an accurate understanding of modular tasks, corresponding to acquisition of a correct world model. We find that noise-driven modularisation can be recapitulated by a deterministic regulariser that multiplicatively combines weights and activations, revealing rich phenomenology not captured in linear networks or by standard regularisation methods. Though the emergence of modular structure requires sufficiently many training samples (exponential in the number of modular task dimensions), we show that pre-modularised ANNs exhibit superior noise-robustness and the ability to generalise and extrapolate well beyond training data, compared to ANNs without such inductive biases. Together, our work demonstrates a regulariser and architectures that could encourage modularity emergence to yield functional benefits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d7\u5bb9\u9519\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u653e\u7535\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6d3b\u52a8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u566a\u58f0\u9a71\u52a8\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u53ca\u5176\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8111\u7535\u8def\u6709\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u51fa\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u5bb9\u9519\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6cca\u677e\u5f0f\u653e\u7535\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6d3b\u52a8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u54cd\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u53ef\u7531\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u91cd\u73b0\uff0c\u9884\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6297\u566a\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u51fa\u73b0\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u529f\u80fd\u76ca\u5904\u3002"}}

However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models. Unlike prior work that emphasizes multi-turn reasoning, VGCO focuses on the single-turn, large-scale tool-calling problem and achieves significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u6587\u6863\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faVGCO\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u6863\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u8bfb\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u66f4\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Verification - Guided Context Optimization (VGCO) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "VGCO\u805a\u7126\u5355\u8f6e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u8c03\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Applying these methods in practice can require discarding valuable data, unnecessarily reducing test power. We address this long-standing limitation by extending the theory of generalized U-statistics and applying it to the usual MMD estimator, resulting in new characterization of the asymptotic distributions of the MMD estimator with unequal sample sizes (particularly outside the proportional regimes required by previous partial results). This generalization also provides a new criterion for optimizing the power of an MMD test with unequal sample sizes. Our approach preserves all available data, enhancing test accuracy and applicability in realistic settings. Along the way, we give much cleaner characterizations of the variance of MMD estimators, revealing something that might be surprising to those in the area: while zero MMD implies a degenerate estimator, it is sometimes possible to have a degenerate estimator with nonzero MMD as well; we give a construction and a proof that it does not happen in common situations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4e24\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5e7f\u4e49U\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f97\u5230MMD\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b0\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u529f\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eMMD\u7684\u4e24\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u4e24\u5206\u5e03\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u76f8\u7b49\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u529f\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u5e7f\u4e49U\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c1\u7684MMD\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230MMD\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5728\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b0\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4f18\u5316MMD\u6d4b\u8bd5\u529f\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9MMD\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u65b9\u5dee\u6709\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u523b\u753b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Using data on 4,323 YC companies from 2005-2024 merged with S&P Global funding data, I estimate OLS regressions with batch year fixed effects on a regression sample of 2,113 companies. The coefficient on prior FAANG work experience is -0.251, indicating approximately 22% less funding. However, this result is not robust, as it changes direction in further analyses, suggesting that FAANG experience may not be a reliable predictor of funding. The most robust finding is that startups within Y Combinator that consist of larger founding teams tend to raise more funding, with each additional co-founder associated with approximately 21% more capital raised. While observable credentials such as prior FAANG work experience and top-tier education explain minimal variation in funding, the size of the founding team emerges as a more consistent predictor, highlighting the importance of team dynamics in securing capital.

In other situations the parallel tasks have constraints that require them to synchronize their start and possibly departure times. This is true of many parallelized machine learning workloads, and the popular Apache Spark processing engine has recently added support for Barrier Execution Mode, which allows users to add such barriers to their jobs. These barriers necessarily result in idle periods on some of the workers, which reduces their stability and performance, compared to equivalent workloads with no barriers.\n  In this paper we will consider and analyze the stability and performance penalties resulting from barriers. We include an analysis of the stability of $(s,k,l)$ barrier systems that allow jobs to depart after $l$ out of $k$ of their tasks complete. We also derive and evaluate performance bounds for hybrid barrier systems servicing a mix of jobs, both with and without barriers, and with varying degrees of parallelism. For the purely 1-barrier case we compare the bounds and simulation results to benchmark data from a standalone Spark system. We study the overhead in the real system, and based on its distribution we attribute it to the dual event and polling-driven mechanism used to schedule barrier-mode jobs. We develop a model for this type of overhead and validate it against the real system through simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5c4f\u969c\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u5c4f\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5c4f\u969c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9\u7a7a\u95f2\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790(s,k,l)\u5c4f\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df7\u5408\u5c4f\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6210\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5c4f\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u627e\u51fa\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u9500\u6765\u6e90\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

This problem is closely related to the classic maximum weight matching problem. In this paper, we propose a $10/17$-approximation algorithm, improving the best-known $7/12$-approximation algorithm (ESA 2015). Our result is obtained by making a trade-off among three algorithms. The first is based on the maximum weight matching of size $n/2$, the second is based on the maximum weight matching of size $n/3$, and the last is based on an approximation algorithm for star packing.

In the first stage, we identify different financial data property from global stock market indices, industrial indices, and financial news based on the perspective of investors. And then, we design appropriate neural network architectures tailored to these properties to generate effective feature representations. Based on learned feature representations, we design multiple meta-classifiers and dynamically select the optimal one for each time window, enabling the model to effectively capture and learn the distinct patterns that emerge across different temporal periods. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we apply it to predicting the daily movement of Shanghai Securities Composite index, SZSE Component index and Growth Enterprise index in Chinese stock market. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in improving the prediction performance. In terms of accuracy metric, our approach outperforms the best competing models by 1.42%, 7.94%, and 7.73% on the SSEC, SZEC, and GEI indices, respectively.

However, current methods are constrained by static reasoning trajectories that are ill-suited for the diverse complexity of user behaviors. They suffer from two key limitations: (1) a static reasoning direction, which uses flat supervision signals misaligned with human-like hierarchical reasoning, and (2) a fixed reasoning depth, which inefficiently applies the same computational effort to all users, regardless of pattern complexity. These rigidity lead to suboptimal performance and significant computational waste. To overcome these challenges, we propose DTRec, a novel and effective framework that explores the Dynamic reasoning Trajectory for Sequential Recommendation along both direction and depth. To guide the direction, we develop Hierarchical Process Supervision (HPS), which provides coarse-to-fine supervisory signals to emulate the natural, progressive refinement of human cognitive processes. To optimize the depth, we introduce the Adaptive Reasoning Halting (ARH) mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of reasoning steps by jointly monitoring three indicators. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving up to a 24.5% performance improvement over strong baselines while simultaneously reducing computational cost by up to 41.6%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9759\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDTRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9759\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9759\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDTRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Hierarchical Process Supervision\uff08HPS\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Adaptive Reasoning Halting\uff08ARH\uff09\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe24.5%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe41.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "DTRec\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Adjudicator models this as a neuro-symbolic task, first constructing a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) to unify item context. This KG then informs a \"Council of Agents,\" a novel multi-agent Large Language Model architecture where specialized agents debate and vote on a label's validity. We validate our system on a 1,000-item balanced subset of the AlleNoise benchmark. Our KG-informed model achieves a 0.99 F1-score, significantly outperforming a single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and a non-KG council (0.59 F1). Our analysis reveals this is due to a Precision, achieved by a novel override logic that uses the KG to perfectly identify complex, structural errors (complete Recall) -- a class of errors that baselines fail to find.

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEvoLattice\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e22\u5f03\u6709\u7528\u53d8\u4f53\u3001\u6709\u7834\u574f\u7f16\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u4e14\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165EvoLattice\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5019\u9009\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6216\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6709\u81ea\u4fee\u590d\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u5148\u524dLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fdb\u5316\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoLattice\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u591a\u66ff\u4ee3\u8868\u793a\u9690\u5f0f\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3002"}}

Recent studies demonstrate an average 39% performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple turns, with models making premature assumptions and failing to course correct (Laban et al., 2025). This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context.\n  We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness.

While compact models are the ultimate deployment target, conventional pruning-aware distributed training systems typically fail to reduce communication overhead because unstructured sparsity cannot be efficiently exploited by highly optimized dense collective primitives. We present PruneX, a distributed data-parallel training system that co-designs pruning algorithms with cluster hierarchy to reduce inter-node bandwidth usage. PruneX introduces the Hierarchical Structured ADMM (H-SADMM) algorithm, which enforces node-level structured sparsity before inter-node synchronization, enabling dynamic buffer compaction that eliminates both zero-valued transmissions and indexing overhead. The system adopts a leader-follower execution model with separated intra-node and inter-node process groups, performing dense collectives on compacted tensors over bandwidth-limited links while confining full synchronization to high-bandwidth intra-node interconnects. Evaluation on ResNet architectures across 64 GPUs demonstrates that PruneX reduces inter-node communication volume by approximately 60% and achieves 6.75x strong scaling speedup, outperforming the dense baseline (5.81x) and Top-K gradient compression (3.71x) on the Puhti supercomputer at CSC - IT Center for Science (Finland).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edfPruneX\uff0c\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u96c6\u7fa4\u5c42\u6b21\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u5e26\u5bbd\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u591a\u8282\u70b9GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u526a\u679d\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faH - SADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u4ece\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u79bb\u8282\u70b9\u5185\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u572864\u4e2aGPU\u7684ResNet\u67b6\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cPruneX\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea660%\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b06.75\u500d\u5f3a\u7f29\u653e\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "PruneX\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u548cTop - K\u68af\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, such numerical simulations are computationally expensive, limiting the real-world practical application of the framework. To address this issue, previous studies have used machine learning to predict the structural responses to ground motions with low computational costs. These studies typically conduct NLTHAs for a few hundreds ground motions and use the results to train and validate surrogate models. However, most of the previous studies focused on computationally-inexpensive response analysis models such as single degree of freedom. Surrogate models of high-fidelity response analysis are required to enrich the quantity and diversity of information used for damage assessment in PBEE. Notably, the computational cost of creating training and validation datasets increases if the fidelity of response analysis model becomes higher. Therefore, methods that enable surrogate modeling of high-fidelity response analysis without a large number of training samples are needed. This study proposes a framework that uses transfer learning to construct the surrogate model of a high-fidelity response analysis model. This framework uses a surrogate model of low-fidelity response analysis as the pretrained model and transfers its knowledge to construct surrogate models for high-fidelity response analysis with substantially reduced computational cost. As a case study, surrogate models that predict responses of a 20-story steel moment frame were constructed with only 20 samples as the training dataset. The responses to the ground motions predicted by constructed surrogate model were consistent with a site-specific time-based hazard.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc720\u5c42\u94a2\u6846\u67b6\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5730\u9707\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u7a0b\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5206\u6790\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5206\u6790\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u4ee520\u5c42\u94a2\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ec5\u752820\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5730\u9707\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u5730\u65f6\u53d8\u707e\u5bb3\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4ee5\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Existing models predominantly follow a discriminative paradigm, which relies heavily on explicit interactions between raw ID embeddings. However, this paradigm inherently renders them susceptible to two critical issues: embedding dimensional collapse and information redundancy, stemming from the over-reliance on feature interactions \\emph{over raw ID embeddings}. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \\emph{Supervised Feature Generation (SFG)} framework, \\emph{shifting the paradigm from discriminative ``feature interaction\" to generative ``feature generation\"}. Specifically, SFG comprises two key components: an \\emph{Encoder} that constructs hidden embeddings for each feature, and a \\emph{Decoder} tasked with regenerating the feature embeddings of all features from these hidden representations. Unlike existing generative approaches that adopt self-supervised losses, we introduce a supervised loss to utilize the supervised signal, \\ie, click or not, in the CTR prediction task. This framework exhibits strong generalizability: it can be seamlessly integrated with most existing CTR models, reformulating them under the generative paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFG consistently mitigates embedding collapse and reduces information redundancy, while yielding substantial performance gains across various datasets and base models.

In addressing the heterogeneity induced by various missing patterns, Mask-Conditional Valid (MCV) Coverage has emerged as a more desirable property than Marginal Coverage. In this work, we adapt split CP to handle missing values by proposing a preimpute-mask-then-correct framework that can offer valid coverage. We show that our method provides guaranteed Marginal Coverage and Mask-Conditional Validity for general missing data mechanisms. A key component of our approach is a reweighted conformal prediction procedure that corrects the prediction sets after distributional imputation (multiple imputation) of the calibration dataset, making our method compatible with standard imputation pipelines.

However, ABI methods are highly sensitive to model misspecification: when observed data fall outside the training distribution (generative scope of the statistical models), neural surrogates can behave unpredictably. This makes it a challenge in a model comparison setting, where multiple statistical models are considered, of which at least some are misspecified. Recent work on self-consistency (SC) provides a promising remedy to this issue, accessible even for empirical data (without ground-truth labels). In this work, we investigate how SC can improve amortized model comparison conceptualized in four different ways. Across two synthetic and two real-world case studies, we find that approaches for model comparison that estimate marginal likelihoods through approximate parameter posteriors consistently outperform methods that directly approximate model evidence or posterior model probabilities. SC training improves robustness when the likelihood is available, even under severe model misspecification. The benefits of SC for methods without access of analytic likelihoods are more limited and inconsistent. Our results suggest practical guidance for reliable amortized Bayesian model comparison: prefer parameter posterior-based methods and augment them with SC training on empirical datasets to mitigate extrapolation bias under model misspecification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08SC\uff09\u5bf9\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u7684\u644a\u9500\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0cSC\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u4f3c\u7136\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u644a\u9500\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\uff08ABI\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08SC\uff09\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76SC\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdb\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u7684\u644a\u9500\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u4e24\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53c2\u6570\u540e\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fb9\u9645\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc1\u636e\u6216\u540e\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4f3c\u7136\u53ef\u7528\u65f6SC\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u89e3\u6790\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u76ca\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884cSC\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

We present a proof-of-concept hybrid execution framework integrating the IRIS asynchronous task-based runtime with the XACC quantum programming framework via the Quantum Intermediate Representation Execution Engine (QIR-EE). IRIS orchestrates multiple programs written in the quantum intermediate representation (QIR) across heterogeneous backends (including multiple quantum simulators), enabling concurrent execution of classical and quantum tasks. Although not a performance study, we report measurable outcomes through the successful asynchronous scheduling and execution of multiple quantum workloads. To illustrate practical runtime implications, we decompose a four-qubit circuit into smaller subcircuits through a process known as quantum circuit cutting, reducing per-task quantum simulation load and demonstrating how task granularity can improve simulator throughput and reduce queueing behavior -- effects directly relevant to early quantum hardware environments.

However, real-world user behaviors are often noisy due to factors such as human errors, uncertainty, and behavioral ambiguity, which can lead to degraded recommendation performance. To address this issue, recent approaches widely adopt self-supervised learning (SSL), particularly contrastive learning, by generating perturbed views of user interaction sequences and maximizing their mutual information to improve model robustness. However, these methods heavily rely on their pre-defined static augmentation strategies~(where the augmentation type remains fixed once chosen) to construct augmented views, leading to two critical challenges: (1) the optimal augmentation type can vary significantly across different scenarios; (2) inappropriate augmentations may even degrade recommendation performance, limiting the effectiveness of SSL. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive augmentation framework. We first unify existing basic augmentation operations into a unified formulation via structured transformation matrices. Building on this, we introduce AsarRec (Adaptive Sequential Augmentation for Robust Sequential Recommendation), which learns to generate transformation matrices by encoding user sequences into probabilistic transition matrices and projecting them into hard semi-doubly stochastic matrices via a differentiable Semi-Sinkhorn algorithm. To ensure that the learned augmentations benefit downstream performance, we jointly optimize three objectives: diversity, semantic invariance, and informativeness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets under varying noise levels validate the effectiveness of AsarRec, demonstrating its superior robustness and consistent improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u56fa\u5b9a\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6AsarRec\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7edf\u4e00\u6210\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAsarRec\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u7528\u6237\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u6362\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1AsarRec\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "AsarRec\u80fd\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes.

Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR data from the May 2024 flood event were processed to produce a binary flood inventory, which served as training data for machine learning (ML) models. Six conditioning factors -- slope, elevation, aspect, land use/land cover, soil type, and distance from streams -- were integrated with the SAR-derived flood inventory to train four supervised classifiers: Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results indicate that RF achieved the highest predictive performance (accuracy = 0.762; Kappa = 0.480), outperforming LR, CART, and SVM. The RF-based susceptibility map showed that low-lying Kano Plains near Lake Victoria have the highest flood vulnerability, consistent with historical flood records and the impacts of the May 2024 event. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SAR data and ensemble ML methods for flood susceptibility mapping in regions with limited data. The resulting maps offer important insights for disaster risk reduction, land-use planning, and early warning system development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408SAR\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u6c34\u6587\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9aNyando\u6d41\u57df\u6d2a\u6c34\u6613\u53d1\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0cRF\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u6210\u679c\u5bf9\u51cf\u707e\u7b49\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d2a\u6c34\u662f\u5168\u7403\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6781\u5927\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5bf9\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9aNyando\u6d41\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6d2a\u6c34\u6613\u53d1\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Sentinel - 1 SAR\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d2a\u6c34\u6e05\u5355\uff0c\u9009\u53d66\u4e2a\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001CART\u3001SVM\u548cRF\u56db\u79cd\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "RF\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eRF\u7684\u6613\u53d1\u6027\u5730\u56fe\u663e\u793a\u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a\u6e56\u9644\u8fd1\u7684Kano\u5e73\u539f\u6d2a\u6c34\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408SAR\u6570\u636e\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u6613\u53d1\u6027\u5236\u56fe\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u6210\u679c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u707e\u3001\u571f\u5730\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

However, their flexibility comes with the drawback of a high-dimensional parameter space. To tackle this problem, truncated vine copulas were introduced by Kurowicka (2010) (Gaussian case) and Brechmann and Czado (2013) (general case). Truncated vine copulas contain conditionally independent pair copulas after the truncation level. So far, in the general case, truncated vine constructing algorithms started from the lowest tree in order to encode the largest dependences in the lower trees. The novelty of this paper starts from the observation that a truncated vine is determined by the first tree after the truncation level (see Kov\u00e1cs and Sz\u00e1ntai (2017)). This paper introduces a new score for fitting truncated vines to given data, called the Weight of the truncated vine. Then we propose a completely new methodology for constructing truncated vines. We prove theorems which motivate this new approach. While earlier algorithms did not use conditional independences, we give algorithms for constructing and encoding truncated vines which do exploit them. Finally, we illustrate the algorithms on real datasets and compare the results with well-known methods included in R packages. Our method generally compare favorably to previously known methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u622a\u65ad\u85e4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u85e4copula\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\uff0c\u622a\u65ad\u85e4copula\u867d\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u4f46\u6784\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u622a\u65ad\u85e4\u6743\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u622a\u65ad\u85e4\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u622a\u65ad\u85e4\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eR\u5305\u4e2d\u77e5\u540d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u622a\u65ad\u85e4\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5df2\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The study focuses on how flexible employment arrangements influence operational efficiency, cost reduction, workforce scalability, market responsiveness, and client satisfaction. A quantitative survey was conducted among managers and owners of Polish enterprises that cooperate with temporary staffing agencies, using purposeful sampling to capture informed managerial perspectives. The findings show that employment flexibility significantly reduces downtime, accelerates onboarding processes, and lowers personnel and recruitment costs. Flexible staffing enables rapid workforce scaling during demand fluctuations and facilitates access to specialized skills without long-term commitments. The results also indicate that employment flexibility enhances organizational responsiveness, improves profitability in short-term projects, and strengthens resilience to seasonal and market volatility. Additionally, flexibility is identified as a key determinant of client satisfaction and loyalty toward staffing service providers. The study demonstrates that employment flexibility is not merely a cost-control mechanism but a strategic human resource capability that supports competitiveness, operational adaptability, and sustainable performance in dynamic labor markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce2\u5170\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u5c31\u4e1a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u65f6\u7528\u5de5\u670d\u52a1\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u662f\u6218\u7565\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5c31\u4e1a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u65f6\u7528\u5de5\u670d\u52a1\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e0e\u4e34\u65f6\u7528\u5de5\u673a\u6784\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u6ce2\u5170\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u548c\u6240\u6709\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u76ee\u7684\u62bd\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u5c31\u4e1a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u5165\u804c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u8c03\u6574\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u83b7\u53d6\u4e13\u4e1a\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u77ed\u671f\u9879\u76ee\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u6ce2\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5ba2\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c31\u4e1a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u6210\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u652f\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3001\u8fd0\u8425\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7ee9\u6548\u7684\u6218\u7565\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Under Review", "summary": "The advent of large language models is contributing to the emergence of novel approaches that promise to better tackle the challenge of generating structured queries, such as SPARQL queries, from natural language. However, these new approaches mostly focus on response accuracy over a single source while ignoring other evaluation criteria, such as federated query capability over distributed data stores, as well as runtime and cost to generate SPARQL queries. Consequently, they are often not production-ready or easy to deploy over (potentially federated) knowledge graphs with good accuracy. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we extend our previous work and describe and systematically evaluate SPARQL-LLM, an open-source and triplestore-agnostic approach, powered by lightweight metadata, that generates SPARQL queries from natural language text. First, we describe its architecture, which consists of dedicated components for metadata indexing, prompt building, and query generation and execution. Then, we evaluate it based on a state-of-the-art challenge with multilingual questions, and a collection of questions from three of the most prevalent knowledge graphs within the field of bioinformatics. Our results demonstrate a substantial increase of 24% in the F1 Score on the state-of-the-art challenge, adaptability to high-resource languages such as English and Spanish, as well as ability to form complex and federated bioinformatics queries. Furthermore, we show that SPARQL-LLM is up to 36x faster than other systems participating in the challenge, while costing a maximum of $0.01 per question, making it suitable for real-time, low-cost text-to-SPARQL applications.

The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices.

Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely.

While much progress has been made in unlearning for LLMs, document classification models remain relatively understudied. In this paper, we study class-level unlearning for document classifiers and present Hessian Reassignment, a two-step, model-agnostic solution. First, we perform a single influence-style update that subtracts the contribution of all training points from the target class by solving a Hessian-vector system with conjugate gradients, requiring only gradient and Hessian-vector products. Second, in contrast to common unlearning baselines that randomly reclassify deleted-class samples, we enforce a decision-space guarantee via Top-1 classification.

Recent research has extended the study of stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) from light-tailed to heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in practice, with clipping emerging as a key technique for controlling heavy-tailed gradients. Extensive theoretical advances have further shown that the oracle complexity of SFOMs depends on the tail index $\u03b1$ of the noise. Nonetheless, existing complexity results often cover only the case $\u03b1\\in (1,2]$, that is, the regime where the noise has a finite mean, while the complexity bounds tend to infinity as $\u03b1$ approaches $1$. This paper tackles the general case of noise with tail index $\u03b1\\in(0,2]$, covering regimes ranging from noise with bounded variance to noise with an infinite mean, where the latter case has been scarcely studied. Through a novel analysis of the bias-variance trade-off in gradient clipping, we show that when a symmetry measure of the noise tail is controlled, clipped SFOMs achieve improved complexity guarantees in the presence of heavy-tailed noise for any tail index $\u03b1\\in (0,2]$. Our analysis of the bias-variance trade-off not only yields new unified complexity guarantees for clipped SFOMs across this full range of tail indices, but is also straightforward to apply and can be combined with classical analyses under light-tailed noise to establish oracle complexity guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u968f\u673a\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c3e\u6307\u6570\u03b1\u2208(0,2]\u7684\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u5dee - \u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u7ecf\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u591a\u53ea\u8986\u76d6\u03b1\u2208(1,2]\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u03b1\u8d8b\u8fd11\u65f6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u03b1\u2208(0,2]\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee - \u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u9896\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u63a7\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u5c3e\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6d4b\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u88c1\u526a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5c3e\u6307\u6570\u03b1\u2208(0,2]\u7684\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u4e0e\u8f7b\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u5230\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

This study presents a unified, unsupervised machine learning framework to detect and classify emerging trade anomalies within UN Comtrade data (2020 to 2024). Moving beyond traditional rule-based monitoring, we apply a four-layer analytical pipeline utilizing Forensic Statistics, Isolation Forests, Network Science, and Deep Autoencoders. Contrary to the hypothesis that Sustainability Arbitrage would be the primary driver, empirical results reveal a contradictory and more severe phenomenon of Hardware Masking. Illicit actors exploit bi-directional tariff incentives by misclassifying scrap as high-count heterogeneous goods to justify extreme unit-price outliers of >$160/kg, a 1,900% markup indicative of Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) rather than commercial arbitrage. Topologically, risk is not concentrated in major exporters but in high-centrality Shadow Hubs that function as pivotal nodes for illicit rerouting. These actors execute a strategy of Void-Shoring, systematically suppressing destination data to Unspecified Code to fracture mirror statistics and sever forensic trails.

Standard RAG systems typically rely on a fixed top k retrieval strategy, which can either miss relevant information or introduce semantically irrelevant passages, known as distractors, that degrade output quality. Additionally, the positioning of retrieved passages within the input context can influence the model attention and generation outcomes. Context placed in the middle tends to be overlooked, which is an issue known as the \"lost in the middle\" phenomenon. In this work, we systematically analyze the impact of distractors on generation quality, and quantify their effects under varying conditions.

As AI systems expand into real-world applications, adapting to personalized values beyond task completion or collective alignment has become a critical challenge. We address this by proposing a value-driven approach to personalized decision-making. Human values serve as stable, transferable signals that support consistent and generalizable behavior across contexts. Compared to task-oriented paradigms driven by external rewards and incentives, value-driven decision-making enhances interpretability and enables agents to act appropriately even in novel scenarios. We introduce ValuePilot, a two-phase framework consisting of a dataset generation toolkit (DGT) and a decision-making module (DMM). DGT constructs diverse, value-annotated scenarios from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. DMM learns to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences, enabling context-sensitive, individualized decisions. When evaluated on previously unseen scenarios, DMM outperforms strong LLM baselines, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2-flash, and Llama-3.1-70b, in aligning with human action choices.

This study developed a machine learning framework to predict RSV-associated hospitalizations in the United States (U.S.) by integrating wastewater surveillance, meteorological, and air quality data. The dataset combined weekly hospitalization rates, wastewater RSV levels, daily meteorological measurements, and air pollutant concentrations. Classification models, including CART, Random Forest, and Boosting, were trained to predict weekly RSV-associated hospitalization rates classified as \\textit{Low risk}, \\textit{Alert}, and \\textit{Epidemic} levels. The wastewater RSV level was identified as the strongest predictor, followed by meteorological and air quality variables such as temperature, ozone levels, and specific humidity. Notably, the analysis also revealed significantly higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Further research is needed to better understand the drivers of RSV disparity in these communities to improve prevention strategies. Furthermore, states at high altitudes, characterized by lower surface pressure, showed consistently higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates. These findings highlight the value of combining environmental and community surveillance data to forecast RSV outbreaks, enabling more timely public health interventions and resource allocation. In order to provide accessibility and practical use of the models, we have developed an interactive R Shiny dashboard (https://f6yxlu-eric-guo.shinyapps.io/rsv_app/), which allows users to explore RSV-associated hospitalization risk levels across different states, visualize the impact of key predictors, and interactively generate RSV outbreak forecasts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e9f\u6c34\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u6c14\u8c61\u548c\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u7f8e\u56fdRSV\u76f8\u5173\u4f4f\u9662\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e9f\u6c34RSV\u6c34\u5e73\u662f\u6700\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u548c\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4eea\u8868\u76d8\u3002", "motivation": "RSV\u662f\u5e7c\u513f\u4f4f\u9662\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5176\u7206\u53d1\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u9884\u6d4bRSV\u76f8\u5173\u4f4f\u9662\u60c5\u51b5\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u5e9f\u6c34\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u6c14\u8c61\u548c\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528CART\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u7b49\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u5468RSV\u76f8\u5173\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5e9f\u6c34RSV\u6c34\u5e73\u662f\u6700\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u7f8e\u6d32\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u548c\u963f\u62c9\u65af\u52a0\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u9ad8\u6d77\u62d4\u5dde\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\u4e5f\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u73af\u5883\u548c\u793e\u533a\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4bRSV\u7206\u53d1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4eea\u8868\u76d8\u4fbf\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

STLS is an algorithm to solve the $\\ell_0$ sparse least-squares problem, which relies on splitting to efficiently solve the least-squares portion while handling the sparse term via proximal methods. It produces coefficient vectors whose components depend on both the projected reconstruction errors, here referred to as the scores, and the mutual coherence of dictionary terms. The first contribution of this work is a theoretical analysis of the score and dictionary-selection strategy. This could be understood in both the original and weak SINDy regime. Second, numerical experiments on ordinary and partial differential equations highlight the effectiveness of score-based screening, improving both accuracy and interpretability in dynamical system identification. These results suggest that integrating score-guided methods to refine the dictionary more accurately may help SINDy users in some cases to enhance their robustness for data-driven discovery of governing equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b57\u5178\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5f97\u5206\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5e93\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9SINDy\u7c7b\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6Sequential Threshold Least Squares (STLS)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5f97\u5206\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5e93\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f97\u5206\u7684\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5f97\u5206\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u5b57\u5178\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8eSINDy\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness.

Property-based testing addresses this shortcoming by generating multiple inputs satisfying properties but requires significant manual effort to define properties and their constraints. We propose a semantics-based approach that automatically transforms unit tests into property-based tests by extracting specifications from implementations via single-path symbolic analysis. We demonstrate this approach through Teralizer, a prototype for Java that transforms JUnit tests into property-based jqwik tests. Unlike prior work that generalizes from input-output examples, Teralizer derives specifications from program semantics.\n  We evaluated Teralizer on three progressively challenging datasets. On EvoSuite-generated tests for EqBench and Apache Commons utilities, Teralizer improved mutation scores by 1-4 percentage points. Generalization of mature developer-written tests from Apache Commons utilities showed only 0.05-0.07 percentage points improvement. Analysis of 632 real-world Java projects from RepoReapers highlights applicability barriers: only 1.7% of projects completed the generalization pipeline, with failures primarily due to type support limitations in symbolic analysis and static analysis limitations in our prototype. Based on the results, we provide a roadmap for future work, identifying research and engineering challenges that need to be tackled to advance the field of test generalization.\n  Artifacts available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17950381", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528Teralizer\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u8f93\u5165\u672a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5c06JUnit\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684jqwik\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cEvoSuite\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u67091 - 4\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7f16\u5199\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6539\u8fdb\u5c0f\uff0c\u4ec51.7%\u9879\u76ee\u5b8c\u6210\u6cdb\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u63a8\u8fdb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u9886\u57df\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

In clinical practice, EEG data are often scarce, patient-specific distributed across institutions, and governed by strict privacy regulations that prohibit data pooling. As a result, creating usable AI-based seizure detection models remains challenging in real-world medical settings. To address these constraints, we propose a two-stage federated few-shot learning (FFSL) framework for personalized EEG-based seizure detection. The method is trained and evaluated on the TUH Event Corpus, which includes six EEG event classes. In Stage 1, a pretrained biosignal transformer (BIOT) is fine-tuned across non-IID simulated hospital sites using federated learning, enabling shared representation learning without centralizing EEG recordings. In Stage 2, federated few-shot personalization adapts the classifier to each patient using only five labeled EEG segments, retaining seizure-specific information while still benefiting from cross-site knowledge.

These complex textual data sets have immense potential to inform future policy and targeted recommendations. However, because SL text data lack dedicated methods and are noisy, heterogeneous, and prone to anomalies, detecting and inferring key patterns is challenging. We introduce LLmFPCA-detect, a flexible framework that pairs LLM-based text embeddings with functional data analysis to detect clusters and infer anomalies in large SL text datasets. First, LLmFPCA-detect embeds each piece of text into an application-specific numeric space using LLM prompts. Sparse multivariate functional principal component analysis (mFPCA) conducted in the numeric space forms the workhorse to recover primary population characteristics, and produces subject-level scores which, together with baseline static covariates, facilitate data segmentation, unsupervised anomaly detection and inference, and enable other downstream tasks. In particular, we leverage LLMs to perform dynamic keyword profiling guided by the data segments and anomalies discovered by LLmFPCA-detect, and we show that cluster-specific functional PC scores from LLmFPCA-detect, used as features in existing pipelines, help boost prediction performance. We support the stability of LLmFPCA-detect with experiments and evaluate it on two different applications using public datasets, Amazon customer-review trajectories, and Wikipedia talk-page comment streams, demonstrating utility across domains and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLLmFPCA - detect\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u7eb5\u5411\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u51fd\u6570\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u7eb5\u5411\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u7528\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "LLmFPCA - detect\u6846\u67b6\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u503c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u503c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u5143\u51fd\u6570\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u6062\u590d\u603b\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e3b\u4f53\u7ea7\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u7ebf\u9759\u6001\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5272\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u4e86LLmFPCA - detect\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5ba2\u6237\u8bc4\u8bba\u548c\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u8ba8\u8bba\u9875\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LLmFPCA - detect\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u7eb5\u5411\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u805a\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6570\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment. Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER.

Drawing on learned helplessness as an analogy, we introduce learned incapacity (LI) as a behavioral descriptor for this selective withholding without implying intentionality or internal mechanisms.

This study introduces the Model of Things (MoT), a model-based approach that incorporates low-code principles to simplify CoT development. MoT reduces technical barriers by providing a custom UML profile designed for IoT and cloud services. To evaluate MoT, we conducted a case study and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The results confirmed MoT's feasibility, demonstrating that it streamlines CoT application development and deployment. Users found MoT accessible, even with limited IoT experience, and reported high perceived ease of use and usefulness. Qualitative feedback highlighted MoT's ability to reduce complexity and speed up development. MoT offers a promising, model-driven solution for CoT application development.

For example, in a mobile shopping interface, users interact with recommendations by scrolling, where each scroll triggers a list of items called slate. Users incur an evaluation cost - time spent assessing item features before deciding to click. Highly relevant items having higher evaluation costs may not fit within the user's time budget, affecting engagement. In this position paper, our objective is to evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms that learn patterns in user preferences and time budgets simultaneously, crafting recommendations with higher engagement potential under resource constraints. Our experiments explore the use of reinforcement learning to recommend items for users using Alibaba's Personalized Re-ranking dataset supporting slate optimization in e-commerce contexts.

To overcome the costliness of the approach, we evaluate more efficient implementations of pairwise comparison-based rating. We achieve this by investigating the effects of various rating techniques and the parameters of three cost-aware alternatives in a simulation environment. Since the approach can in principle be applied to both human and large language model annotation, our work provides a basis for creating high-quality benchmark datasets and for quantifying biases and other subjective linguistic aspects.\n  The controlled simulations include latent severity distributions, distance-calibrated noise, and synthetic annotator bias to probe robustness and cost-quality trade-offs. In applying the approach to human-labeled bias benchmark datasets, we then evaluate the most promising setups and compare them to direct assessment by large language models and unmodified pairwise comparison labels as baselines. Our findings support the use of pairwise comparison as a practical foundation for quantifying subjective linguistic aspects, enabling reproducible bias analysis.

Our main technical result is a density theorem: under uniform tightness of agent outputs and a Lipschitz AAI functional, the subspace of batteries generated by mathematical theorem-proving and coding tasks is dense in the moduli space of batteries with respect to the evaluation metric. Coding alone is universal in this sense, while pure mathematics is not; its privilege is spectral rather than expressive. We interpret this as evidence that mathematics and coding provide ``universal coordinates'' for evaluation, and that formal mathematics is a natural ignition domain for recursive self-improvement in advanced AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5728AI\u667a\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5b9a\u7406\u53ca\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5728AI\u667a\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eAAI\u6846\u67b6\u548cGVU\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u5b66\u7ea4\u7ef4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u5185\u6838\u7814\u7a76GVU\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u7eaf\u6570\u5b66\u65e0\u6b64\u7279\u6027\u4f46\u6709\u9891\u8c31\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u2018\u901a\u7528\u5750\u6807\u2019\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u6570\u5b66\u662f\u9ad8\u7ea7AI\u9012\u5f52\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u542f\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

As these systems scale, sustainability concerns have intensified, with most assessments focusing on model architecture, hardware efficiency, and deployment infrastructure. However, existing mitigation efforts largely overlook how user interaction practices themselves shape the energy profile of LLM based systems. In this vision paper, we argue that interaction level behavior appears to be an underexamined factor shaping the environmental impact of LLM based systems, and we present this issue across four dimensions. First, extended conversational patterns increase token production and raise the computational cost of inference. Second, expectations of instant responses limit opportunities for energy aware scheduling and workload consolidation. Third, everyday user habits contribute to cumulative operational demand in ways that are rarely quantified. Fourth, the accumulation of context affects memory requirements and reduces the efficiency of long running dialogues. Addressing these challenges requires rethinking how chatbot interactions are designed and conceptualized, and adopting perspectives that recognize sustainability as partly dependent on the conversational norms through which users engage with LLM based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u67b6\u6784\u7b49\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u56db\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u51f8\u663e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u5ffd\u89c6\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5ef6\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5373\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u671f\u671b\u3001\u65e5\u5e38\u7528\u6237\u4e60\u60ef\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u79ef\u7d2f\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5bf9LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u89c4\u8303\u8003\u91cf\u3002"}}

Adaptive delayed matching creates a trade-off between matching and pickup delays by deciding whether to assign drivers immediately or batch requests. Since outcomes accumulate over long horizons with stochastic dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) is a suitable framework. However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns.\n  We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder. Unlike monolithic networks, our experts specialize automatically, improving representation capacity while maintaining computational efficiency. A physics-informed congestion surrogate preserves realistic density-speed feedback, enabling millions of efficient rollouts, while an adaptive reward scheme guards against pathological strategies.\n  With only 12M parameters, our framework outperforms strong baselines. On real-world Uber trajectory data (San Francisco), it improves total reward by over 13%, reducing average matching and pickup delays by 10% and 15% respectively. It demonstrates robustness across unseen demand regimes and stable training.

However, limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations remain key challenges for real-world use. To address these issues, we introduce RUNE (Reasoning Using Neurosymbolic Entities), an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with neurosymbolic AI to retrieve images by reasoning over the compatibility between detected entities and First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions derived from text queries. Unlike RS-LVLMs that rely on implicit joint embeddings, RUNE performs explicit reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability. For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance.

We introduce the Semantic Grounding Index (SGI), defined as the ratio of angular distances from the response to the question versus the context on the unit hypersphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.Our central finding is \\emph{semantic laziness}: hallucinated responses remain angularly proximate to questions rather than departing toward retrieved contexts. On HaluEval ($n$=5,000), we observe large effect sizes (Cohen's $d$ ranging from 0.92 to 1.28) across five embedding models with mean cross-model correlation $r$=0.85. Crucially, we derive from the spherical triangle inequality that SGI's discriminative power should increase with question-context angular separation $\u03b8(q,c)$-a theoretical prediction confirmed empirically: effect size rises monotonically from $d$=0.61 -low $\u03b8(q,c)$, to $d$=1.27 -high $\u03b8(q,c)$, with AUC improving from 0.72 to 0.83. Subgroup analysis reveals that SGI excels on long responses ($d$=2.05) and short questions ($d$=1.22), while remaining robust across context lengths. Calibration analysis yields ECE=0.10, indicating SGI scores can serve as probability estimates, not merely rankings.

Dropout methods are regularisation techniques for training NNs, first introduced by G. Hinton et al. (2012). These methods temporarily remove connections in the NN, randomly at each stage of training, and update the remaining subnetwork with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The process of removing connections from a network at random is similar to percolation, a paradigm model of statistical physics.\n  If dropout were to remove enough connections such that there is no path between the input and output of the NN, then the NN could not make predictions informed by the data.

This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines.

Acquiring such high-resolution wind data, however, remains a challenging and expensive endeavour. Traditional reconstruction approaches are typically either cost-effective or accurate, but not both. Deep learning methods, including diffusion models, have been proposed to resolve this trade-off by leveraging advances in natural image super-resolution. Wind data, however, is distinct from natural images, and wind super-resolvers often use upwards of 10 input channels, significantly more than the usual 3-channel RGB inputs in natural images. To better leverage a large number of conditioning variables in diffusion models, we present a generalization of classifier-free guidance (CFG) to multiple conditioning inputs. Our novel composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) can be dropped into any pre-trained diffusion model trained with standard CFG dropout. We demonstrate that CCFG outputs are higher-fidelity than those from CFG on wind super-resolution tasks.

However, FL continues to face key challenges, including weak client incentives, privacy risks, and resource constraints. Assessing client reliability is essential for fair incentive allocation and ensuring that each client's data contributes meaningfully to the global model. To this end, we propose MURIM, a MUlti-dimensional Reputation-based Incentive Mechanism that jointly considers client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness while preventing malicious or unreliable clients from earning undeserved rewards.

Improper use of the HAL can lead to incorrect hardware operations, resulting in system failure and potentially serious damage to the hardware. The question is how one can obtain prioritize, among a possibly large set of HAL interface requirements, those that are indisputably relevant for preventing this kind of system failure. In this paper, we introduce a formal notion of relevance. This allows us to leverage a formal method, i.e., software model checking, to produce a mathematical proof that a requirement is indisputably relevant. We propose an approach to extract provably relevant requirements from issue reports on system failures. We present a case study to demonstrate that the approach is feasible in principle. The case study uses three examples of issue reports on embedded applications that use the SPI bus via the spidev HAL.

This challenge is ubiquitous in fields such as fluid mechanics, seismic inversion, and structural health monitoring. Existing deep and operator-learning models collapse under these conditions: fixed-grid assumptions fail, reconstruction deteriorates sharply, and inversion becomes unreliable with limited robustness and no uncertainty quantification (UQ).We propose the Physical Inversion Solver (PIS), a set-conditioned diffusion framework enabling inversion from truly arbitrary observation sets. PIS employs a Set Transformer-based encoder to handle measurements of any number or geometry, and a cosine-annealed sparsity curriculum for exceptional robustness. An accompanying information-theoretic analysis provides insight into the limits of inversion under extreme sparsity by revealing how observation entropy varies across physical systems.PIS is evaluated on three challenging PDE inverse problems: Darcy flow, wavefield inversion (Helmholtz), and structural health monitoring (Hooke's Law). Across all tasks and sparsity regimes -- including extreme cases with an observation rate of only $0.29\\%$ -- existing operator-learning baselines fail to reconstruct meaningful fields, often diverging or collapsing entirely.In stark contrast, PIS remains stable and accurate, reducing inversion error by $12.28\\%$--$88.73\\%$ and reliably producing calibrated posterior samples. These samples accurately reflect both data scarcity and intrinsic physical ambiguity. These results position PIS as a powerful, general-purpose, and uniquely sparsity-resilient solution for physical inversion under arbitrary and severely undersampled observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u53cd\u6f14\u6c42\u89e3\u5668PIS\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027PDE\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u53cd\u6f14\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u95f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u758f\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPIS\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eSet Transformer\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u9000\u706b\u7a00\u758f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027PDE\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0cPIS\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u53cd\u6f14\u8bef\u5dee12.28% - 88.73%\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u6210\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u9a8c\u6837\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "PIS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53cd\u6f14\u3002"}}

Georgiev, G${\u00f3}$mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner [GGSTW+25] demonstrate that AI systems can explore new constructions and improve existing bounds, illustrating the growing potential of LLMs to accelerate mathematical discovery. Similarly, Bubeck et al. [BCE+25] show that GPT-5 can meaningfully contribute to scientific workflows, from proposing hypotheses to generating proofs and analyses. Despite these advances, a rigorous evaluation of these models on canonical, graduate-level mathematical theory remains necessary to understand their baseline reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of four frontier models: GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, and Grok-4 against the classic curriculum of Randomized Algorithms by Motwani and Raghavan [MR95].\n  We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook. We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx. 66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx. 40%). We provide a qualitative analysis of the generated proofs, highlighting differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure. Our results suggest that while frontier models have reached a threshold of proficiency suitable for graduate-level pedagogical assistance and formalization, significant variance exists in their reliability for rigorous mathematical derivation.

Despite these advancements, a persistent challenge remains--selecting the optimal ranks for each layer to jointly optimise compression rate and downstream task accuracy. Current methods either rely on heuristics that can yield sub-optimal results due to their limited discrete search space or are gradient-based but are not as performant as heuristic approaches without post-compression fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose Learning to Low-Rank Compress (LLRC), a gradient-based approach which directly learns the weights of masks that select singular values in a fine-tuning-free setting. Using a calibration dataset, we train only the mask weights to select fewer and fewer singular values while minimising the divergence of intermediate activations from the original model. Our approach outperforms competing ranking selection methods that similarly require no post-compression fine-tuning across various compression rates on common-sense reasoning and open-domain question-answering tasks. For instance, with a compression rate of 20% on Llama-2-13B, LLRC outperforms the competitive Sensitivity-based Truncation Rank Searching (STRS) on MMLU, BoolQ, and OpenbookQA by 12%, 3.5%, and 4.4%, respectively. Compared to other compression techniques, our approach consistently outperforms fine-tuning-free variants of SVD-LLM and LLM-Pruner across datasets and compression rates.

A distinctive ability of these reasoning models is self-reflection: the ability to review and revise previous reasoning steps. While self-reflection enhances reasoning performance, it also increases inference cost. In this work, we study self-reflection through the lens of representation engineering. We segment the model's reasoning into steps, identify the steps corresponding to reflection, and extract a reflection direction in the latent space that governs this behavior. Using this direction, we propose a stepwise steering method that can control reflection frequency. We call our framework ReflCtrl. Our experiments show that (1) in many cases reflections are redundant, especially in stronger models (in our experiments, we can save up to 33.6 percent of reasoning tokens while preserving performance), and (2) the model's reflection behavior is highly correlated with an internal uncertainty signal, implying self-reflection may be controlled by the model's uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u63d0\u51faReflCtrl\u6846\u67b6\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u601d\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u53cd\u601d\u6709\u5197\u4f59\u53ca\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u6bb5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u53cd\u601d\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f88\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53cd\u601d\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8282\u7701\u63a8\u7406token\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u601d\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ReflCtrl\u6846\u67b6\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u601d\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u601d\u6216\u53ef\u7531\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Federated Recommendation (FR) enables such multi-end collaborative training while preserving privacy by sharing model parameters instead of raw data. However, the large number of parameters, primarily due to the massive item embeddings, significantly hampers communication efficiency. While existing studies mainly focus on improving the efficiency of FR models, they largely overlook the issue of embedding parameter overhead. To address this gap, we propose a FR training framework with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) based embedding designed to reduce the volume of embedding parameters that need to be transmitted. Our approach offers a lightweight, plugin-style solution that can be seamlessly integrated into existing FR methods. In addition to incorporating common PEFT techniques such as LoRA and Hash-based encoding, we explore the use of Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RQ-VAE) as a novel PEFT strategy within our framework. Extensive experiments across various FR model backbones and datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces communication overhead while improving accuracy.

However, the standard Top-k routing strategy imposes a uniform sparsity pattern that ignores the varying difficulty of tokens. While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers.

While existing approaches excel in recognizing the distinct patterns under the low-dimensional scenarios, they often fail to robustly capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies when learning representations from the high-dimensional noisy time series. To address these limitations, we propose DARTs, a robust long short-term dual-path framework with window-aware spatiotemporal soft fusion mechanism, which can be primarily decomposed into three complementary components. Specifically, in the short-term path, we introduce a Multi-View Sparse Graph Learner and a Diffusion Multi-Relation Graph Unit that collaborate to adaptively capture hierarchical discriminative short-term spatiotemporal patterns in the high-noise time series. While in the long-term path, we design a Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Constructor to model salient long-term dynamics within the high-dimensional representation space. Finally, a window-aware spatiotemporal soft-fusion mechanism is introduced to filter the residual noise while seamlessly integrating anomalous patterns.

Moreover, it is an essential ingredient in a new approach to linear regression via convex $M$-estimation, where the corresponding error densities are projected onto the log-concave class. Motivated by these applications, we study the minimax risk of score estimation with respect to squared $L^2(P_0)$-loss, where $P_0$ denotes an underlying log-concave distribution on $\\mathbb{R}$. Such distributions have decreasing score functions, but on its own, this shape constraint is insufficient to guarantee a finite minimax risk. We therefore define subclasses of log-concave densities that capture two fundamental aspects of the estimation problem. First, we establish the crucial impact of tail behaviour on score estimation by determining the minimax rate over a class of log-concave densities whose score function exhibits controlled growth relative to the quantile levels. Second, we explore the interplay between smoothness and log-concavity by considering the class of log-concave densities with a scale restriction and a $(\u03b2,L)$-H\u00f6lder assumption on the log-density for some $\u03b2\\in [1,2]$. We show that the minimax risk over this latter class is of order $L^{2/(2\u03b2+1)}n^{-\u03b2/(2\u03b2+1)}$ up to poly-logarithmic factors, where $n$ denotes the sample size. When $\u03b2< 2$, this rate is faster than could be obtained under either the shape constraint or the smoothness assumption alone. Our upper bounds are attained by a locally adaptive, multiscale estimator constructed from a uniform confidence band for the score function. This study highlights intriguing differences between the score estimation and density estimation problems over this shape-constrained class.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6570\u51f9\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5f97\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5c3e\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u9636\u5e76\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f97\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6570\u51f9\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5f97\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u5bf9\u6570\u51f9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5b50\u7c7b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5c3e\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6570\u51f9\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u548c\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5747\u5300\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5e26\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5c3e\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u9636\u4e3a $L^{2/(2\u03b2+1)}n^{-\u03b2/(2\u03b2+1)}$ \uff1b\u5c40\u90e8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f97\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u8be5\u5f62\u72b6\u7ea6\u675f\u7c7b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u8da3\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

However, the process of labeling MDD remains challenging. As a self-supervised learning method, contrastive learning could address the shortcomings of supervised learning methods, which are unduly reliant on labels in the context of MDD detection. However, existing contrastive learning methods are not specifically designed to characterize the time-frequency distribution of EEG signals, and their capacity to acquire low-semantic data representations is still inadequate for MDD detection tasks. To address the problem of contrastive learning method, we propose a time-frequency fusion and multi-domain cross-loss (TF-MCL) model for MDD detection. TF-MCL generates time-frequency hybrid representations through the use of a fusion mapping head (FMH), which efficiently remaps time-frequency domain information to the fusion domain, and thus can effectively enhance the model's capacity to synthesize time-frequency information. Moreover, by optimizing the multi-domain cross-loss function, the distribution of the representations in the time-frequency domain and the fusion domain is reconstructed, thereby improving the model's capacity to acquire fusion representations.

However, the substantial computational demand restricts access to LLM almost exclusively through cloud-based service, which makes LLM-based decision support tools impractical for dairy farming. To address this gap, lightweight alternatives capable of running locally on farm hardware are required. In this work, we benchmarked 20 open-source Small Language Models (SLM) available on HuggingFace under farm-realistic computing constraints. Building on our prior work, we developed an agentic AI system that integrates five task-specific agents: literature search, web search, SQL database interaction, NoSQL database interaction, and graph generation following predictive models. Evaluation was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, five test questions were used for the initial screening to identify models capable of following basic dairy-related instructions and performing reliably in a compute-constrained environment. Models that passed this preliminary stage were then evaluated using 30 questions (five per task category mentioned above, plus one category addressing integrity and misconduct) in phase two. In results, Qwen-4B achieved superior performance across most of task categories, although showed unstable effectiveness in NoSQL database interactions through PySpark. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly evaluating the feasibility of SLM as engines for dairy farming decision-making, with central emphases on privacy and computational efficiency.

Current defense strategies often rely on computationally expensive external classifiers or brittle lexical filters, overlooking the intrinsic dynamics of the model's reasoning process. In this work, the Laminar Flow Hypothesis is introduced, which posits that benign inputs induce smooth, gradual transitions in an LLM's high-dimensional latent space, whereas adversarial prompts trigger chaotic, high-variance trajectories - termed Semantic Turbulence - resulting from the internal conflict between safety alignment and instruction-following objectives. This phenomenon is formalized through a novel, zero-shot metric: the variance of layer-wise cosine velocity. Experimental evaluation across diverse small language models reveals a striking diagnostic capability. The RLHF-aligned Qwen2-1.5B exhibits a statistically significant 75.4% increase in turbulence under attack (p less than 0.001), validating the hypothesis of internal conflict. Conversely, Gemma-2B displays a 22.0% decrease in turbulence, characterizing a distinct, low-entropy \"reflex-based\" refusal mechanism.

Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings.

However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation.

Depth Up-Scaling (DUS) has emerged as a promising strategy by duplicating layers and applying Continual Pre-training (CPT), but its reliance on feed-forward networks (FFNs) limits efficiency and attainable gains. We introduce Memory-Infused Depth Up-Scaling (MIDUS), which replaces FFNs in duplicated blocks with a head-wise memory (HML) layer. Motivated by observations that attention heads have distinct roles both across and within layers, MIDUS assigns an independent memory bank to each head, enabling head-wise retrieval and injecting information into subsequent layers while preserving head-wise functional structure. This design combines sparse memory access with head-wise representations and incorporates an efficient per-head value factorization module, thereby relaxing the usual efficiency-performance trade-off. Across our CPT experiments, MIDUS exhibits robust performance improvements over strong DUS baselines while maintaining a highly efficient parameter footprint. Our findings establish MIDUS as a compelling and resource-efficient alternative to conventional FFN replication for depth up-scaling by leveraging its head-wise memory design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6ce8\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\uff08MIDUS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u5934\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\uff08DUS\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\uff08FFNs\uff09\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6ce8\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\uff08MIDUS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5934\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08HML\uff09\u5c42\u66ff\u6362\u91cd\u590d\u5757\u4e2d\u7684FFNs\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5206\u914d\u72ec\u7acb\u5185\u5b58\u5e93\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u5934\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5934\u90e8\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08CPT\uff09\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cMIDUS\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684DUS\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5360\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "MIDUS\u7684\u5934\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edfFFN\u590d\u5236\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike traffic volume data, probe vehicle speeds and static road attributes are more broadly accessible and support full coverage of road segments in most urban networks.

However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary information across views, leading to suboptimal feature representations and limited performance. To address this, we propose MV-SupGCN, a semi-supervised GCN model that integrates several complementary components with clear motivations and mutual reinforcement. First, to better capture discriminative features and improve model generalization, we design a joint loss function that combines Cross-Entropy loss with Supervised Contrastive loss, encouraging the model to simultaneously minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class separability in the latent space. Second, recognizing the instability and incompleteness of single graph construction methods, we combine both KNN-based and semi-supervised graph construction approaches on each view, thereby enhancing the robustness of the data structure representation and reducing generalization error. Third, to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled data and enhance semantic alignment across multiple views, we propose a unified framework that integrates contrastive learning in order to enforce consistency among multi-view embeddings and capture meaningful inter-view relationships, together with pseudo-labeling, which provides additional supervision applied to both the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions to enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MV-SupGCN consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our integrated approach.

However, despite the convincing benchmark performance, successful translation to real applications is limited. The frequent disconnect between performance on controlled BCI benchmarks and its lack of generalisation to practical settings indicates hidden overfitting problems. We introduce Disentangled Decoding Decomposition (D3), a weakly supervised method for training deep learning models across EEG datasets. By predicting the place in the respective trial sequence from which the input window was sampled, EEG-D3 separates latent components of brain activity, akin to non-linear ICA. We utilise a novel model architecture with fully independent sub-networks for strict interpretability. We outline a feature interpretation paradigm to contrast the component activation profiles on different datasets and inspect the associated temporal and spatial filters. The proposed method reliably separates latent components of brain activity on motor imagery data. Training downstream classifiers on an appropriate subset of these components prevents hidden overfitting caused by task-correlated artefacts, which severely affects end-to-end classifiers. We further exploit the linearly separable latent space for effective few-shot learning on sleep stage classification. The ability to distinguish genuine components of brain activity from spurious features results in models that avoid the hidden overfitting problem and generalise well to real-world applications, while requiring only minimal labelled data.

However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation.

However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data.

In this paper, we investigate whether this human improvement strategy can be applied to improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for alignment of language models (LMs). In particular, it is observed in the literature that LMs tuned by RLHF can still output unsatisfactory responses. This paper proposes a method to improve the unsatisfactory responses by correcting their causes. Our method has two parts. The first part proposes a post-hoc explanation method to explain why an unsatisfactory response is generated to a prompt by identifying the training data that lead to this response. We formulate this problem as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to find a set of training data closest to this prompt-response pair in a feature representation space, and the constraint is that the prompt-response pair can be decomposed as a convex combination of this set of training data in the feature space.

The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.\n  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.\n  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.\n  Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement. This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.\n  Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD.

Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing.

However, deployment of such solutions is limited by privacy concerns around audio data, sensitivity to background noise, and domain shift across recording environments. We present an end-to-end infant cry analysis pipeline that integrates a denoising autoencoder (DAE), a convolutional tokenizer, and a Transformer encoder trained using communication-efficient federated learning (FL). The system performs on-device denoising, adaptive segmentation, post hoc calibration, and energy-based out-of-distribution (OOD) abstention. Federated training employs a regularized control variate update with 8-bit adapter deltas under secure aggregation. Using the Baby Chillanto and Donate-a-Cry datasets with ESC-50 noise overlays, the model achieves a macro F1 score of 0.938, an AUC of 0.962, and an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.032, while reducing per-round client upload from approximately 36 to 42 MB to 3.3 MB.

However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions.

One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement. On an NVIDIA H100, OPTIMA prunes a 8B-parameter transformer end-to-end in 40 hours with 60GB peak memory.

However, empirical evidence suggests that such long-context LLMs can consume far more text than they can reliably use. On the other hand, it has been shown that inference-time compute can be used to scale performance of LLMs, often by generating thinking tokens, on challenging tasks involving multi-step reasoning. Through controlled experiments on sandbox long-context tasks, we find that such inference-time strategies show rapidly diminishing returns and fail at long context. We attribute these failures to score dilution, a phenomenon inherent to static self-attention. Further, we show that current inference-time strategies cannot retrieve relevant long-context signals under certain conditions. We propose a simple method that, through targeted gradient updates on the given context, provably overcomes limitations of static self-attention. We find that this shift in how inference-time compute is spent leads to consistently large performance improvements across models and long-context benchmarks. Our method leads to large 12.6 and 14.1 percentage point improvements for Qwen3-4B on average across subsets of LongBench-v2 and ZeroScrolls benchmarks. The takeaway is practical: for long context, a small amount of context-specific training is a better use of inference compute than current inference-time scaling strategies like producing more thinking tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u9759\u6001\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5982Qwen3 - 4B\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534712.6\u548c14.1\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\uff09\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \\emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \\emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \\emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines \"minimal sufficient sets\" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faContext - Picker\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5148\u53ec\u56de\u5bfc\u5411\uff0c\u540e\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u5411\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc1\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u7ba1\u9053\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cContext - Picker\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3aRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ee5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u683c\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

Accurate precipitation forecasts are vital for society. Reliable predictions help communities mitigate climatic impacts. Based on the current relevance of artificial intelligence (AI), classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been used as an alternative or complement to dynamic modeling. However, there is still a lack of broad investigations into the feasibility of purely data-driven approaches for precipitation forecasting. This study aims at addressing this issue where different classical ML and DL approaches for forecasting precipitation in South America, taking into account all 2019 seasons, are considered in a detailed investigation. The selected classical ML techniques were Random Forests and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), while the DL counterparts were a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN 1D), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. Additionally, the Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model (BAM) was used as a representative of the traditional dynamic modeling approach. We also relied on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide some explanations for the models behaviors. LSTM showed strong predictive performance while BAM, the traditional dynamic model representative, had the worst results. Despite presented the higher latency, LSTM was most accurate for heavy precipitation. If cost is a concern, XGBoost offers lower latency with slightly accuracy loss.

Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes.

Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively.

Typically, BO iteratively updates a probabilistic surrogate model of this mapping and optimizes acquisition functions derived from the model to guide molecule selection. However, its performance is limited in low-data regimes with insufficient prior knowledge and vast candidate spaces. Large language models (LLMs) and chemistry foundation models offer rich priors to enhance BO, but high-dimensional features, costly in-context learning, and the computational burden of deep Bayesian surrogates hinder their full utilization. To address these challenges, we propose a likelihood-free BO method that bypasses explicit surrogate modeling and directly leverages priors from general LLMs and chemistry-specific foundation models to inform acquisition functions. Our method also learns a tree-structured partition of the molecular search space with local acquisition functions, enabling efficient candidate selection via Monte Carlo Tree Search. By further incorporating coarse-grained LLM-based clustering, it substantially improves scalability to large candidate sets by restricting acquisition function evaluations to clusters with statistically higher property values. We show through extensive experiments and ablations that the proposed method substantially improves scalability, robustness, and sample efficiency in LLM-guided BO for molecular discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u4f3c\u7136\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5b50\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5927\u5019\u9009\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5229\u7528\u53d7\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u963b\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u4f3c\u7136\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5b50\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u53d1\u73b0\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Most existing studies in this field have concentrated on news articles, where journalists usually follow a fixed writing style.

In today's digital era, a massive amount of Bangla content is continuously produced across blogs, newspapers, and social media. This creates a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand content more quickly. To address this challenge, we developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources, including blogs such as Cinegolpo and newspapers such as Samakal and The Business Standard. Unlike single-domain resources, our dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. It offers greater adaptability and practical relevance.

However, few existing methods account for recurring structures, or patterns, that appear within the data. We present Pattern-Guided Diffusion Models (PGDM), which leverage inherent patterns within temporal data for forecasting future time steps. PGDM first extracts patterns using archetypal analysis and estimates the most likely next pattern in the sequence. By guiding predictions with this pattern estimate, PGDM makes more realistic predictions that fit within the set of known patterns. We additionally introduce a novel uncertainty quantification technique based on archetypal analysis, and we dynamically scale the guidance level based on the pattern estimate uncertainty.

However, achieving exact invariance to specific symmetries typically requires designing bespoke architectures for each group of symmetries, limiting scalability and preventing knowledge transfer across related symmetries. In the case of the space groups, symmetries critical to modeling crystalline solids in materials science and condensed matter physics, this challenge is particularly salient as there are 230 such groups in three dimensions. In this work we present a new approach to such crystallographic symmetries by developing a single machine learning architecture that is capable of adapting its weights automatically to enforce invariance to any input space group. Our approach is based on constructing symmetry-adapted Fourier bases through an explicit characterization of constraints that group operations impose on Fourier coefficients. Encoding these constraints into a neural network layer enables weight sharing across different space groups, allowing the model to leverage structural similarities between groups and overcome data sparsity when limited measurements are available for specific groups. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving competitive performance on material property prediction tasks and performing zero-shot learning to generalize to unseen groups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u610f\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7fa4\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5df2\u77e5\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u878d\u5165\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u9700\u4e3a\u6bcf\u7ec4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9a\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e09\u7ef4230\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7fa4\u65f6\u6311\u6218\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u7fa4\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7cfb\u6570\u65bd\u52a0\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u6784\u9020\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u9002\u914d\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57fa\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7fa4\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u7fa4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6676\u4f53\u5b66\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8de8\u7fa4\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002"}}

However, compared to the more widely studied MHC-I in computational immunotherapy, the study of MHC-II antigenic epitope poses significantly more challenges due to its complex binding specificity and ambiguous motif patterns. Consequently, existing datasets for MHC-II interactions are smaller and less standardized than those available for MHC-I. To address these challenges, we present a well-curated dataset derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other public sources. It not only extends and standardizes existing peptide-MHC-II datasets, but also introduces a novel antigen-MHC-II dataset with richer biological context. Leveraging this dataset, we formulate three major machine learning (ML) tasks of peptide binding, peptide presentation, and antigen presentation, which progressively capture the broader biological processes within the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway. We further employ a multi-scale evaluation framework to benchmark existing models, along with a comprehensive analysis over various modeling designs to this problem with a modular framework.

Most existing jailbreak methods revolve around Prompt Engineering or adversarial optimization, yet we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon: many harmful scenarios are highly consistent with legitimate ones in terms of underlying principles. Based on this finding, this paper proposes the Safe2Harm Semantic Isomorphism Attack method, which achieves efficient jailbreaking through four stages: first, rewrite the harmful question into a semantically safe question with similar underlying principles; second, extract the thematic mapping relationship between the two; third, let the LLM generate a detailed response targeting the safe question; finally, reversely rewrite the safe response based on the thematic mapping relationship to obtain harmful output. Experiments on 7 mainstream LLMs and three types of benchmark datasets show that Safe2Harm exhibits strong jailbreaking capability, and its overall performance is superior to existing methods.

Existing approaches typically model MTS data in either Euclidean or Riemannian space, limiting their ability to capture the diverse geometric structures and complex spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in real-world data. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Hybrid Symmetric Positive-Definite Manifold Graph Neural Network (HSMGNN), a novel graph neural network-based model that captures data geometry within a hybrid Euclidean-Riemannian framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage hybrid geometric representations for MTS forecasting, enabling expressive and comprehensive modeling of geometric properties. Specifically, we introduce a Submanifold-Cross-Segment (SCS) embedding to project input MTS into both Euclidean and Riemannian spaces, thereby capturing spatio-temporal variations across distinct geometric domains. To alleviate the high computational cost of Riemannian distance, we further design an Adaptive-Distance-Bank (ADB) layer with a trainable memory mechanism. Finally, a Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (FGCN) is devised to integrate features from the dual spaces via a learnable fusion operator for accurate prediction.

Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable progress in these areas in recent years, constructing an efficient, multi-task compatible, and generalizable unified framework for time series analysis remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches are often tailored to single tasks or specific data types, making it difficult to simultaneously handle multi-task modeling and effectively integrate information across diverse time series types. Moreover, real-world data are often affected by noise, complex frequency components, and multi-scale dynamic patterns, which further complicate robust feature extraction and analysis. To ameliorate these challenges, we propose FusAD, a unified analysis framework designed for diverse time series tasks. FusAD features an adaptive time-frequency fusion mechanism, integrating both Fourier and Wavelet transforms to efficiently capture global-local and multi-scale dynamic features. With an adaptive denoising mechanism, FusAD automatically senses and filters various types of noise, highlighting crucial sequence variations and enabling robust feature extraction in complex environments. In addition, the framework integrates a general information fusion and decoding structure, combined with masked pre-training, to promote efficient learning and transfer of multi-granularity representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FusAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on mainstream time series benchmarks for classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks, while maintaining high efficiency and scalability.

So far, language models seem to be aligned with the values of Western countries, but evidence for this ethical bias comes mostly from models made by American companies. The current crop of state-of-the-art models includes several made in China, so we conducted the first large-scale investigation of how models made in China and the USA align with people from China and the USA. We elicited responses to the Moral Foundations Questionnaire 2.0 and the World Values Survey from ten Chinese models and ten American models, and we compared their responses to responses from thousands of Chinese and American people. We found that all models respond to both surveys more like American people than like Chinese people. This skew toward American values is only slightly mitigated when prompting the models in Chinese or imposing a Chinese persona on the models.

Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel \"token rounding\" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE. Concretely, SonicMoE on 64 H100s achieves a training throughput of 213 billion tokens per day comparable to ScatterMoE's 225 billion tokens per day on 96 H100s for a 7B MoE model training with FSDP-2 using the lm-engine codebase. Under high MoE sparsity settings, our tile-aware token rounding algorithm yields an additional 1.16x speedup on kernel execution time compared to vanilla top-$K$ routing while maintaining similar downstream performance. We open-source all our kernels to enable faster MoE model training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSonicMoE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u5185\u6838\u52a9\u529bMoE\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u7a00\u758fMoE\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u9ad8\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cd\u53e0\u5185\u5b58IO\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684GPU\u5185\u6838\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u201ctoken rounding\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "SonicMoE\u51cf\u5c1145%\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53471.86\u500d\uff0ctile - aware token rounding\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f1.16\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347MoE\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u5185\u6838\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdb\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

A DIFNO is an FNO trained by minimizing its prediction error jointly on output and Fr\u00e9chet derivative samples of a high-fidelity operator (e.g., a parametric PDE solution operator). As a result, a DIFNO can closely emulate not only the high-fidelity operator's response but also its sensitivities. To motivate the use of DIFNOs instead of conventional FNOs as surrogate models, we show that accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires accurate surrogate Fr\u00e9chet derivatives. Then, for continuously differentiable operators, we establish (i) simultaneous universal approximation of FNOs and their Fr\u00e9chet derivatives on compact sets, and (ii) universal approximation of FNOs in weighted Sobolev spaces with input measures that have unbounded supports. Our theoretical results certify the capability of FNOs for accurate derivative-informed operator learning and accurate solution of PDE-constrained optimization.

However, the quality and stability of the trained reward model largely determine the final alignment performance. Existing approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely heavily on reward models to guide LLMs toward human-aligned behaviors.\n  In this work, we propose a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism as an alternative to conventional reward modeling. Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences. Since real-world questions can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, to ensure that logic-based reinforcement learning does not cause model collapse, we introduce S-GRPO, a supervised variant of the GRPO framework. S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness. Furthermore, it extends existing preference-learning frameworks such as GRPO and DPO, offering a more flexible and task-adaptive approach to alignment training.

However, current deep learning-based RPP methods lack proactive environmental modeling, struggle with realistic multi-transmitter scenarios, and generalize poorly under distribution shifts, particularly when training/testing environments differ in building density or transmitter configurations. This paper identifies three key issues: (1) passive environmental modeling that overlooks transmitters and key environmental features; (2) overemphasis on single-transmitter scenarios despite real-world multi-transmitter prevalence; (3) excessive focus on in-distribution performance while neglecting distribution shift challenges. To address these, we propose PathFinder, a novel architecture that actively models buildings and transmitters via disentangled feature encoding and integrates Mask-Guided Low-rank Attention to independently focus on receiver and building regions. We also introduce a Transmitter-Oriented Mixup strategy for robust training and a new benchmark, single-to-multi-transmitter RPP (S2MT-RPP), tailored to evaluate extrapolation performance (multi-transmitter testing after single-transmitter training).

In this paper, we first introduce CMER-Bench, a carefully constructed benchmark that categorizes expressions into three difficulty levels: easy, moderate, and complex. Leveraging CMER-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing MER models and general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The results reveal that while current methods perform well on easy and moderate expressions, their performance degrades significantly when handling complex mathematical expressions, mainly because existing public training datasets are primarily composed of simple samples. In response, we propose MER-17M and CMER-3M that are large-scale datasets emphasizing the recognition of complex mathematical expressions. The datasets provide rich and diverse samples to support the development of accurate and robust complex MER models.

In this paper, we first reveal that PGD is actually a specific reformulation of the projected gradient method using only the current gradient to determine its step-size. Further, we show that when we utilize a conventional adaptive matrix with the accumulated gradients to scale the perturbation, PGD becomes AdaGrad.

AdaMI is proved to attain optimal convergence for convex problems, indicating that it addresses the non-convergence issue of MI-FGSM, thereby ensuring stability of the optimization process.

Hyperbolic feature spaces are well-suited for this purpose, as they naturally capture hierarchical and relational structure often present in complex RL environments. However, leveraging these spaces commonly faces optimization challenges due to the nonstationarity of RL. In this work, we identify key factors that determine the success and failure of training hyperbolic deep RL agents. By analyzing the gradients of core operations in the Poincar\u00e9 Ball and Hyperboloid models of hyperbolic geometry, we show that large-norm embeddings destabilize gradient-based training, leading to trust-region violations in proximal policy optimization (PPO). Based on these insights, we introduce Hyper++, a new hyperbolic PPO agent that consists of three components: (i) stable critic training through a categorical value loss instead of regression; (ii) feature regularization guaranteeing bounded norms while avoiding the curse of dimensionality from clipping; and (iii) using a more optimization-friendly formulation of hyperbolic network layers. In experiments on ProcGen, we show that Hyper++ guarantees stable learning, outperforms prior hyperbolic agents, and reduces wall-clock time by approximately 30%.

A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty. Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations. An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes. To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems. LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information. As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \\geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\\%$ noise injection.

Building on a regularization-based framework for structured model learning, we focus on learning parameterized reaction terms and investigate how to incorporate key physical properties, such as mass conservation and quasipositivity, directly into the learning process. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose techniques to systematically modify a given class of parameterized reaction terms such that the resulting terms inherently satisfy mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring that the learned RD systems preserve non-negativity and adhere to physical principles. These modifications also guarantee well-posedness of the resulting PDEs under additional regularity and growth conditions. Second, we extend existing theoretical results on regularization-based model learning to RD systems using these physically consistent reaction terms. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the learning problem converge to a unique, regularization-minimizing solution of a limit system even when conservation laws and quasipositivity are enforced. In addition, we provide approximation results for quasipositive functions, essential for constructing physically consistent parameterizations. These results advance the development of interpretable and reliable data-driven models for RD systems that align with fundamental physical laws.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u5e94 - \u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u5e94 - \u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fee\u6539\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u9879\u4f7f\u5176\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d28\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u548c\u62df\u6b63\u6027\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fee\u6539\u53cd\u5e94\u9879\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1PDE\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6781\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u89e3\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u62df\u6b63\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u7b26\u5408\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u53cd\u5e94 - \u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Graph Generative Models (GGMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, leveraging deep learning techniques to learn the underlying distribution of real-world graphs and generate new samples that closely resemble them. Examples include approaches based on Variational Auto-Encoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more recently, diffusion-based models. However, the main limitation often lies in the evaluation process, which typically relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to assess the distribution of graph properties in the generated ensemble. This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating GGMs that overcomes the limitations of MMD, which we call RGM (Representation-aware Graph-generation Model evaluation). As a practical demonstration of our methodology, we present a comprehensive evaluation of two state-of-the-art Graph Generative Models: Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRAN) and Efficient and Degree-guided graph GEnerative model (EDGE). We investigate their performance in generating realistic graphs and compare them using a Geometric Deep Learning model trained on a custom dataset of synthetic and real-world graphs, specifically designed for graph classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while both models can generate graphs with certain topological properties, they exhibit significant limitations in preserving the structural characteristics that distinguish different graph domains.

Large language models can generate clinical text, yet they struggle with visual reasoning and often produce unstable or incorrect explanations. This leaves a gap between what a model sees and the type of reasoning a clinician expects. We introduce a framework that links image classification with structured clinical reasoning. A new hybrid model, MobileCoAtNet, is designed for endoscopic images and achieves high accuracy across eight stomach-related classes. Its outputs are then used to drive reasoning by several LLMs. To judge this reasoning, we build two expert-verified benchmarks covering causes, symptoms, treatment, lifestyle, and follow-up care. Thirty-two LLMs are evaluated against these gold standards. Strong classification improves the quality of their explanations, but none of the models reach human-level stability. Even the best LLMs change their reasoning when prompts vary. Our study shows that combining DL with LLMs can produce useful clinical narratives, but current LLMs remain unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions. The framework provides a clearer view of their limits and a path for building safer reasoning systems.

Our algorithm consists of two branches: spatial processing and time evolution. Regarding the spatial processing, the classical module encodes the local topological features of the road network based on the GCN method, and the quantum module is designed to map graph features onto parameterized quantum circuits through a differentiable pooling layer. The time evolution is solved by integrating multi-source contextual information and capturing dynamic trip dependencies on the classical TCN theory.

Our empirical study shows that text-only reasoning consistently outperforms vision-only or vision-text settings, with multimodal inputs often performing worse than text alone.

Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_\u03c6$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

Here, we present SuperWing, a comprehensive open dataset of transonic swept-wing aerodynamics comprising 4,239 parameterized wing geometries and 28,856 Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes flow field solutions. The wing shapes in the dataset are generated using a simplified yet expressive geometry parameterization that incorporates spanwise variations in airfoil shape, twist, and dihedral, allowing for an enhanced diversity without relying on perturbations of a baseline wing. All shapes are simulated under a broad range of Mach numbers and angles of attack covering the typical flight envelope. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we benchmark two state-of-the-art Transformers that accurately predict surface flow and achieve a 2.5 drag-count error on held-out samples.

Specifically, GRAFT strictly aligns daily-aggregated news, social media, and policy texts with half-hour load, and realizes text-guided fusion to specific time positions via cross-attention during both training and rolling forecasting. In addition, GRAFT provides a plug-and-play external-memory interface to accommodate different information sources in real-world deployment. We construct and release a unified aligned benchmark covering 2019--2021 for five Australian states (half-hour load, daily-aligned weather/calendar variables, and three categories of external texts), and conduct systematic, reproducible evaluations at three scales -- hourly, daily, and monthly -- under a unified protocol for comparison across regions, external sources, and time scales. Experimental results show that GRAFT significantly outperforms strong baselines and reaches or surpasses the state of the art across multiple regions and forecasting horizons. Moreover, the model is robust in event-driven scenarios and enables temporal localization and source-level interpretation of text-to-load effects through attention read-out.

We introduce ClimaX-LETKF, the first purely data-driven ML-based ensemble weather forecasting system. It operates stably over multiple years, independently of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, by assimilating the NCEP ADP Global Upper Air and Surface Weather Observations. The system demonstrates greater stability and accuracy with relaxation to prior perturbation (RTPP) than with relaxation to prior spread (RTPS), while NWP models tend to be more stable with RTPS.

Using 2D tissue simulations incorporating healthy, fibrotic, and gap junction-remodelled conditions, the model achieved high accuracy (mean $R^2 = 0.99 \\pm 0.01$).

Across centers, polysomnography (PSG) recordings are traditionally scored in 30-s epochs for pragmatic, not physiological, reasons and can vary considerably in electrode count, montage, and subject characteristics. These constraints present challenges in conducting harmonized multi-center sleep studies and discovering novel, robust biomarkers on shorter timescales. Here, we present AnySleep, a deep neural network model that uses any electroencephalography (EEG) or electrooculography (EOG) data to score sleep at adjustable temporal resolutions. We trained and validated the model on over 19,000 overnight recordings from 21 datasets collected across multiple clinics, spanning nearly 200,000 hours of EEG and EOG data, to promote robust generalization across sites. The model attains state-of-the-art performance and surpasses or equals established baselines at 30-s epochs. Performance improves as more channels are provided, yet remains strong when EOG is absent or when only EOG or single EEG derivations (frontal, central, or occipital) are available. On sub-30-s timescales, the model captures short wake intrusions consistent with arousals and improves prediction of physiological characteristics (age, sex) and pathophysiological conditions (sleep apnea), relative to standard 30-s scoring.

Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics.

Our method integrates lightweight bottleneck modules within CLIPSeg's vision and text encoders, with adapter dimensions dynamically scaled based on layer depth and semantic relevance. Using only 613k trainable parameters--244x fewer than end-to-end fine-tuning, Telescopic Adapters achieve superior performance across five diverse medical datasets spanning polyp segmentation, skin lesion detection, and breast ultrasound imaging.

However, current counterfactual techniques for time series classification are predominantly designed with static data assumptions and focus on generating minimal input perturbations to flip model predictions. This paper argues that such approaches are fundamentally insufficient in clinical recommendation settings, where interventions unfold over time and must be causally plausible and temporally coherent. We advocate for a shift towards counterfactuals that reflect sustained, goal-directed interventions aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics. We identify critical gaps in existing methods that limit their practical applicability, specifically, temporal blind spots and the lack of user-centered considerations in both method design and evaluation metrics. To support our position, we conduct a robustness analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for time series and show that the generated counterfactuals are highly sensitive to stochastic noise. This finding highlights their limited reliability in real-world clinical settings, where minor measurement variations are inevitable. We conclude by calling for methods and evaluation frameworks that go beyond mere prediction changes without considering feasibility or actionability.

The model integrates residual bidirectional gated recurrent units for sequential modeling of feature columns, a channel reweighting block, and multi-head self-attention pooling with a learnable classification token to capture global context. We evaluate the model on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 5-fold stratified cross-validation and compare it against classical methods such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, as well as modern deep learning baselines including DeepMLP, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and Transformers. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.861, macro-F1 of 0.860, ROC-AUC of 0.908, and PR-AUC of 0.904, outperforming all baselines. Ablation studies confirm the individual contributions of residual recurrence, channel gating, and attention pooling. t-SNE visualizations further indicate that the learned embeddings exhibit clearer separation between disease and non-disease classes compared to raw features.

Previously, we introduced hybrid solvers by combining the classical solvers with neural operators for a specific geometry 1, but they tend to under-perform in geometries not encountered during training. To address this challenge, we introduce Geo-DeepONet, a geometry-aware deep operator network that incorporates domain information extracted from finite element discretizations.

We also prove that OW-HNPV is mathematically stable. It behaves in a controlled, predictable way, even when comparing persistence diagrams from networks with different feature types. Applied to Ethereum transaction networks (May 2017-May 2018), OW-HNPV demonstrates superior performance for cryptocurrency anomaly detection, achieving up to 10.4% AUC gain over baseline models for 7-day price movement predictions. Compared with established methods, including Vector of Averaged Bettis (VAB), persistence landscapes, and persistence images, velocity-based summaries excel at medium- to long-range forecasting (4-7 days), with OW-HNPV providing the most consistent and stable performance across prediction horizons.

This approach has long been known to lack formal guarantees on both (near-)optimality and sample efficiency.

We then extend QR-MAX to continuous state spaces with Bucket-QR-MAX, a SimHash-based discretiser that preserves the same factorized structure and achieves fast and stable learning without manual gridding or function approximation.

We implement a proof-of-concept pipeline and conduct a rigorous performance analysis across a multi-tiered hardware setup, including commodity (NVIDIA RTX 4060), cloud (NVIDIA T4), and enterprise (NVIDIA A100) GPUs. Our objective evaluation demonstrates that the system achieves real-time throughput ($\u03c4< 1.0$) on modern hardware. A subjective user study further validates the approach, showing that a predictable, initial processing delay is highly acceptable to users in exchange for a smooth, uninterrupted playback experience.

To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter.

Additionally, our framework maps core legal requirements to concrete verification activities, serving as a vital bridge between policymakers and practitioners, and aligning legal text with technical standards and best practices. The proposed approach aims to reduce interpretive uncertainty, promote consistency in assessment practices, and support the alignment of regulatory, ethical, and technical perspectives across the AI lifecycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6b27\u76df\u5b9e\u65bdAI\u6cd5\u89c4\u7f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b27\u76df\u5b9e\u65bdAI\u6cd5\u6848\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u89c4\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u76d1\u7ba1\u6a21\u7cca\u7ed9\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u5e26\u6765\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4e14\u51c6\u5907\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u65b9\u6cd5\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u4ea7\u54c1\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5408\u89c4\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c06\u6838\u5fc3\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8981\u6c42\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301AI\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u76d1\u7ba1\u3001\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u6280\u672f\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$\u0394$ are provided.

Extended version with full proofs, parameter sweeps, and appendices", "summary": "Contemporary reservoir computing relies heavily on smooth, globally Lipschitz continuous activation functions, limiting applications in defense, disaster response, and pharmaceutical modeling where robust operation under extreme conditions is critical. We systematically investigate non-smooth activation functions, including chaotic, stochastic, and fractal variants, in echo state networks. Through comprehensive parameter sweeps across 36,610 reservoir configurations, we demonstrate that several non-smooth functions not only maintain the Echo State Property (ESP) but outperform traditional smooth activations in convergence speed and spectral radius tolerance. Notably, the Cantor function (continuous everywhere and flat almost everywhere) maintains ESP-consistent behavior up to spectral radii of rho ~ 10, an order of magnitude beyond typical bounds for smooth functions, while achieving 2.6x faster convergence than tanh and ReLU. We introduce a theoretical framework for quantized activation functions, defining a Degenerate Echo State Property (d-ESP) that captures stability for discrete-output functions and proving that d-ESP implies traditional ESP. We identify a critical crowding ratio Q=N/k (reservoir size / quantization levels) that predicts failure thresholds for discrete activations. Our analysis reveals that preprocessing topology, rather than continuity per se, determines stability: monotone, compressive preprocessing maintains ESP across scales, while dispersive or discontinuous preprocessing triggers sharp failures. While our findings challenge assumptions about activation function design in reservoir computing, the mechanism underlying the exceptional performance of certain fractal functions remains unexplained, suggesting fundamental gaps in our understanding of how geometric properties of activation functions influence reservoir dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56de\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5316\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u9884\u5904\u7406\u62d3\u6251\u51b3\u5b9a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u5f62\u51fd\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u660e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f9d\u8d56\u5149\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5bf936,610\u79cd\u50a8\u5c42\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u53c2\u6570\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5316\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u90e8\u5206\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u51fd\u6570\u4fdd\u6301\u56de\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8c31\u534a\u5f84\u5bb9\u9650\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u62e5\u6324\u6bd4\u9884\u6d4b\u79bb\u6563\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u9608\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u5904\u7406\u62d3\u6251\u51b3\u5b9a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u5f62\u51fd\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u6709\u5f85\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This begs the question whether we can emulate this behavior in synthetic matter and drive it to a point where the collective behavior reaches the complexity level of intelligent systems. Here, we will use a formalized notion of \"intelligent matter\" and compare it to recent results in the field of active matter. First, we will explore the approach of emergent computing in which specialized active matter systems are designed to directly solve a given task through emergent behavior.

Early identification of patients at risk for deterioration is essential not only for patient care quality monitoring but also for physician care management. However, translating varied data streams into accurate and interpretable risk assessments poses significant challenges due to inconsistent data formats. We develop a multimodal machine learning framework, the Early Warning Index (EWI), to predict the aggregate risk of ICU admission, emergency response team dispatch, and mortality. Key to EWI's design is a human-in-the-loop process: clinicians help determine alert thresholds and interpret model outputs, which are enhanced by explainable outputs using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to highlight clinical and operational factors (e.g., scheduled surgeries, ward census) driving each patient's risk. We deploy EWI in a hospital dashboard that stratifies patients into three risk tiers. Using a dataset of 18,633 unique patients at a large U.S. hospital, our approach automatically extracts features from both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data and achieves C-statistics of 0.796. It is currently used as a triage tool for proactively managing at-risk patients. The proposed approach saves physicians valuable time by automatically sorting patients of varying risk levels, allowing them to concentrate on patient care rather than sifting through complex EHR data. By further pinpointing specific risk drivers, the proposed model provides data-informed adjustments to caregiver scheduling and allocation of critical resources. As a result, clinicians and administrators can avert downstream complications, including costly procedures or high readmission rates and improve overall patient flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6EWI\u9884\u6d4b\u60a3\u8005\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u533b\u9662\u4eea\u8868\u76d8\uff0c\u7528\u7f8e\u56fd\u5927\u533b\u9662\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u5206\u8bca\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u533b\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u9662\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u60a3\u8005\u6076\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6EWI\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u5728\u73af\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u7ea7\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u752818633\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316EHR\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\uff0cC\u7edf\u8ba1\u503c\u8fbe0.796\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7528\u4f5c\u5206\u8bca\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8282\u7701\u533b\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u53ef\u8c03\u6574\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

We introduce Materials Agents for Simulation and Theory in Electronic-structure Reasoning (MASTER), an active learning framework where large language models autonomously design, execute, and interpret atomistic simulations. In MASTER, a multimodal system translates natural language into density functional theory workflows, while higher-level reasoning agents guide discovery through a hierarchy of strategies, including a single agent baseline and three multi-agent approaches: peer review, triage-ranking, and triage-forms. Across two chemical applications, CO adsorption on Cu-surface transition metal (M) adatoms and on M-N-C catalysts, reasoning-driven exploration reduces required atomistic simulations by up to 90% relative to trial-and-error selection. Reasoning trajectories reveal chemically grounded decisions that cannot be explained by stochastic sampling or semantic bias.

Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. To study this, we introduce a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) benchmark of 1,000+ heterogeneous games that exhibit significant visual domain gaps. Existing approaches, including VLMs and world models, struggle to capture underlying physics and causality since they are not focused on core mechanisms and overfit to visual details. VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on levels from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning, and even surpasses GPT-5 overall. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games.

The models achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% overall accuracy for classification on optical images, whereas the initial performance on greyscale holographic images was substantially lower. We addressed the performance gap issue through dataset expansion using automated labeling and bounding box area enlargement. These techniques, applied to holographic images, improved detection performance from 2.49% to 13.3% mAP50 and classification performance from 42% to 54%.

This complexity generates overwhelming volumes of operational data, leading to critical bottlenecks in conventional systems: inefficient information processing, poor task coordination, and loss of contextual continuity during fault diagnosis and remediation. To address these challenges, we propose AOI (AI-Oriented Operations), a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that integrates three specialized agents with an LLM-based Context Compressor. Its core innovations include: (1) a dynamic task scheduling strategy that adaptively prioritizes operations based on real-time system states, and (2) a three-layer memory architecture comprising Working, Episodic, and Semantic layers that optimizes context retention and retrieval. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that AOI effectively mitigates information overload, achieving a 72.4% context compression ratio while preserving 92.8% of critical information and significantly enhances operational efficiency, attaining a 94.2% task success rate and reducing the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) by 34.4% compared to the best baseline.

This work presents two primary contributions to address these issues. Memo2496, a large-scale dataset, offers 2496 instrumental music tracks with continuous valence arousal labels, annotated by 30 certified music specialists. Annotation quality is ensured through calibration with extreme emotion exemplars and a consistency threshold of 0.25, measured by Euclidean distance in the valence arousal space. Furthermore, the Dual-view Adaptive Music Emotion Recogniser (DAMER) is introduced. DAMER integrates three synergistic modules: Dual Stream Attention Fusion (DSAF) facilitates token-level bidirectional interaction between Mel spectrograms and cochleagrams via cross attention mechanisms; Progressive Confidence Labelling (PCL) generates reliable pseudo labels employing curriculum-based temperature scheduling and consistency quantification using Jensen Shannon divergence; and Style Anchored Memory Learning (SAML) maintains a contrastive memory queue to mitigate cross-track feature drift. Extensive experiments on the Memo2496, 1000songs, and PMEmo datasets demonstrate DAMER's state-of-the-art performance, improving arousal dimension accuracy by 3.43%, 2.25%, and 0.17%, respectively.

Accurate identification of the types of IoT devices and their associated actions through network traffic analysis is essential to mitigate potential threats. By monitoring and analysing packet flows between IoT devices and connected networks, anomalous or malicious behaviours can be detected. Existing research focuses primarily on device identification within local networks using methods such as protocol fingerprinting and wireless frequency scanning. However, these approaches are limited in their ability to monitor or classify IoT devices externally. To address this gap, we investigate the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), in conjunction with targeted network traffic monitoring to classify IoT device types and their actions. We constructed a testbed comprising an NPAT-enabled router and a diverse set of IoT devices, including smart cameras, controller hubs, home appliances, power controllers, and streaming devices. Experimental results demonstrate that IoT device and action recognition is feasible using our proposed ML-driven approach, with the RF classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 91%, while the MLP recorded the lowest accuracy at 56%.

Key frame sampling is crucial for efficient long-form video understanding. In long video QA, selecting informative frames enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve both accuracy and efficiency. KFS-Bench addresses the limitation of prior works that only indirectly assess frame selection quality via QA accuracy. By providing ground-truth annotations of multiple disjoint scenes required per question, KFS-Bench allows us to directly analyze how different sampling approaches capture essential content across an entire long video. Using KFS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive study of key frame sampling methods and identify that not only sampling precision but also scene coverage and sampling balance are the key factors influencing QA performance. Regarding all the factors, we design a novel sampling quality metric that correlates with QA accuracy.

The authors developed two teleoperation interfaces to control the robots and collect the demonstrations needed, both of which proved effective for training robots for long-horizon and dexterous tasks. In addition, the authors conduct a three-stage evaluation. First, the authors compare a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) policy with a Deep Q-network (DQN) imitation model to identify the stronger RL baseline, focusing on model performance, generalization, and a pick-up experiment. Second, three different VLA models are trained in two different scenarios and compared with each other. Third, the authors benchmark the selected RL baseline against the VLA model using computational and sample-efficiency measures and then a robot experiment on a multi-stage panel installation task that includes transport and installation. The VLA model demonstrates strong generalization and few-shot capability, achieving 60% and 100% success in the pickup phase. In comparison, DQN can be made robust but needs additional noise during tuning, which increases the workload. Overall, the findings indicate that VLA offers practical advantages for changing tasks by reducing programming effort and enabling useful performance with minimal data, while DQN provides a viable baseline when sufficient tuning effort is acceptable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30VLA\u6a21\u578b\u548cRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6559\u5efa\u7b51\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0VLA\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cDQN\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u8c03\u4f18\u4e0b\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u548cRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u6559\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6240\u9700\u52aa\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u4e2a\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u63a5\u53e3\u6536\u96c6\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u6bd4RL\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83VLA\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "VLA\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u62fe\u53d6\u9636\u6bb5\u6210\u529f\u738760%\u548c100%\uff1bDQN\u8c03\u4f18\u9700\u989d\u5916\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "VLA\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7f16\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\uff1bDQN\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u8db3\u591f\u8c03\u4f18\u65f6\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

For the first time, we explore the use of Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) as the core implicit map representation in a neural SLAM pipeline, a paradigm that trains a lightweight network to directly map 2D image features to 3D global coordinates. SCR networks provide efficient, low-memory 3D map representations, enable extremely fast relocalization, and inherently preserve privacy, making them particularly suitable for neural implicit SLAM.\n  Our system is the first one to achieve strict real-time in neural implicit RGB-D SLAM by relying on a SCR-based representation. We introduce a novel SCR architecture specifically tailored for this purpose and detail the critical design choices required to integrate SCR into a live SLAM pipeline. The resulting framework is simple yet flexible, seamlessly supporting both sparse and dense features, and operates reliably in dynamic environments without special adaptation. We evaluate our approach on established synthetic and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating competitive performance against the state of the art.

This failure stems from their reliance on ungrounded, text-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.While existing multi-modal CoT approaches attempt mitigation, they suffer from two fundamental flaws: (1) decoupled perception and reasoning stages that prevent end-to-end joint optimization, and (2) reliance on expensive, dense localization labels.Thus we introduce OmniDrive-R1, an end-to-end VLM framework designed for autonomous driving, which unifies perception and reasoning through an interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) mechanism. Our core innovation is an Reinforcement-driven visual grounding capability, enabling the model to autonomously direct its attention and \"zoom in\" on critical regions for fine-grained analysis. This capability is enabled by our pure two-stage reinforcement learning training pipeline and Clip-GRPO algorithm. Crucially, Clip-GRPO introduces an annotation-free, process-based grounding reward. This reward not only eliminates the need for dense labels but also circumvents the instability of external tool calls by enforcing real-time cross-modal consistency between the visual focus and the textual reasoning. Extensive experiments on DriveLMM-o1 demonstrate our model's significant improvements.

To instantiate this idea, we propose FacEDiT, a speech-conditional Diffusion Transformer trained with flow matching. Inspired by masked autoencoders, FacEDiT learns to synthesize masked facial motions conditioned on surrounding motions and speech. This formulation enables both localized generation and edits, such as substitution, insertion, and deletion, while ensuring seamless transitions with unedited regions. In addition, biased attention and temporal smoothness constraints enhance boundary continuity and lip synchronization. To address the lack of a standard editing benchmark, we introduce FacEDiTBench, the first dataset for talking face editing, featuring diverse edit types and lengths, along with new evaluation metrics.

To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76AR\u5230dLM\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210Efficient - DLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLMs\uff09\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08AR\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3AR\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548dLM\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u5206\u5757\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u518d\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Efficient - DLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709AR\u6a21\u578b\u548cdLMs\uff0c\u5982Efficient - DLM 8B\u6bd4Dream 7B\u548cQwen3 4B\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u539f\u5219\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684AR\u5230dLM\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6548dLMs\u3002"}}

While scene graphs offer a structured abstraction of surgical events, their full potential remains untapped. In this work, we introduce ProtoFlow, a novel framework that learns dynamic scene graph prototypes to model complex surgical workflows in an interpretable and robust manner.\n  Methods: ProtoFlow leverages a graph neural network (GNN) encoder-decoder architecture that combines self-supervised pretraining for rich representation learning with a prototype-based fine-tuning stage. This process discovers and refines core prototypes that encapsulate recurring, clinically meaningful patterns of surgical interaction, forming an explainable foundation for workflow analysis.\n  Results: We evaluate our approach on the fine-grained CAT-SG dataset. ProtoFlow not only outperforms standard GNN baselines in overall accuracy but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in limited-data, few-shot scenarios, maintaining strong performance when trained on as few as one surgical video. Our qualitative analyses further show that the learned prototypes successfully identify distinct surgical sub-techniques and provide clear, interpretable insights into workflow deviations and rare complications.\n  Conclusion: By uniting robust representation learning with inherent explainability, ProtoFlow represents a significant step toward developing more transparent, reliable, and data-efficient AI systems, accelerating their potential for clinical adoption in surgical training, real-time decision support, and workflow optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3AI\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u6ce8\u89e3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faProtoFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u624b\u672f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5411\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u597d\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc8\u8fdb\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u624b\u672f\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u63a8\u8fdbAI\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u6ce8\u89e3\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u3002", "method": "ProtoFlow\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684CAT - SG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cProtoFlow\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6GNN\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8fd8\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u624b\u672f\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "ProtoFlow\u5c06\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5411\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc8\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u5176\u5728\u624b\u672f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the \\textit{extensor digitorum communis} (EDC) and \\textit{flexor digitorum superficialis} (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($\u03a3$), field-strength variation rate ($\u03a6$), and spatial complexity ($\u03a9$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \\times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\\mathrm{R}^2_{\\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models.

Although analytic solutions exist for pulse timings that are optimal under specific noise regimes, identifying the optimal timings for a realistic noise spectrum remains challenging. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for designing pulse sequences on qubits. Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited.

In this paper, we propose SportsGPT, an LLM-driven framework for interpretable sports motion assessment and training guidance, which establishes a closed loop from motion time-series input to professional training guidance. First, given a set of high-quality target models, we introduce MotionDTW, a two-stage time series alignment algorithm designed for accurate keyframe extraction from skeleton-based motion sequences. Subsequently, we design a Knowledge-based Interpretable Sports Motion Assessment Model (KISMAM) to obtain a set of interpretable assessment metrics (e.g., insufficient extension) by constrasting the keyframes with the targe models. Finally, we propose SportsRAG, a RAG-based training guidance model based on Qwen3. Leveraging a 6B-token knowledge base, it prompts the LLM to generate professional training guidance by retrieving domain-specific QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that MotionDTW significantly outperforms traditional methods with lower temporal error and higher IoU scores.

While large tech companies rely on dedicated ML infrastructure engineers to analyze torch traces and benchmarks, such resource-intensive workflows are largely inaccessible to computer vision researchers in general. Among the challenges, pinpointing problematic trace segments within lengthy execution traces remains the most time-consuming task, and is difficult to automate with current ML models, including LLMs. In this work, we present the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate and improve ML models' ability to detect anti patterns in traces. Our dataset contains over 600 PyTorch traces from diverse computer vision models classification, detection, segmentation, and generation collected across multiple hardware platforms. We also propose a novel iterative approach: a lightweight ML model first detects trace segments with anti patterns, followed by a large language model (LLM) for fine grained classification and targeted feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms unsupervised clustering and rule based statistical techniques for detecting anti pattern regions.

While this architecture decouples the reasoning engine from tool execution to enhance scalability, it introduces a significant privacy surface: third-party MCP servers, acting as semi-honest intermediaries, can observe detailed tool interaction logs outside the user's trusted boundary. In this paper, we first identify and formalize a novel privacy threat termed Intent Inversion, where a semi-honest MCP server attempts to reconstruct the user's private underlying intent solely by analyzing legitimate tool calls. To systematically assess this vulnerability, we propose IntentMiner, a framework that leverages Hierarchical Information Isolation and Three-Dimensional Semantic Analysis, integrating tool purpose, call statements, and returned results, to accurately infer user intent at the step level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IntentMiner achieves a high degree of semantic alignment (over 85%) with original user queries, significantly outperforming baseline approaches.

A crucial component of QNNs is the encoder, which maps classical input data into quantum states. However, choosing suitable encoders remains a significant challenge, largely due to the lack of systematic guidance and the trial-and-error nature of current approaches. This process is further impeded by two key challenges: (1) the difficulty in evaluating encoded quantum states prior to training, and (2) the lack of intuitive methods for analyzing an encoder's ability to effectively distinguish data features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel visualization tool, XQAI-Eyes, which enables QNN developers to compare classical data features with their corresponding encoded quantum states and to examine the mixed quantum states across different classes. By bridging classical and quantum perspectives, XQAI-Eyes facilitates a deeper understanding of how encoders influence QNN performance. Evaluations across diverse datasets and encoder designs demonstrate XQAI-Eyes's potential to support the exploration of the relationship between encoder design and QNN effectiveness, offering a holistic and transparent approach to optimizing quantum encoders.

In this work, we develop a physics-informed neural network framework for solving two-phase Stefan problems. The proposed method explicitly tracks the interface motion and enforces the discontinuity in the temperature gradient across the interface while maintaining global consistency of the temperature field. Our approach employs two neural networks: one representing the moving interface and the other for the temperature field. The interface network allows rapid categorization of thermal diffusivity in the spatial domain, which is a crucial step for selecting training points for the temperature network. The temperature network's input is augmented with a modified zero-level set function to accurately capture the jump in its normal derivative across the interface. Numerical experiments on two-phase dynamical Stefan problems demonstrate the superior accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed method compared with the ones obtained by other neural network methodology in literature. The results indicate that the proposed framework offers a robust and flexible alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving phase-change problems governed by moving boundaries.

Its modular design allows ELVIS to integrate different codecs, inpainting models, and quality metrics, making it adaptable to future innovations.

Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made notable progress in automated chart understanding, yet they remain heavily dependent on explicit textual annotations and the performance degrades markedly when key numerals are absent. To address this limitation, we introduce ChartAgent, a chart understanding framework grounded in Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). Inspired by human cognition, ChartAgent decomposes complex chart analysis into a sequence of observable, replayable steps. Supporting this architecture is an extensible, modular tool library comprising more than a dozen core tools, such as keyelement detection, instance segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR), which the agent dynamically orchestrates to achieve systematic visual parsing across diverse chart types. Leveraging TIRs transparency and verifiability, ChartAgent moves beyond the black box paradigm by standardizing and consolidating intermediate outputs into a structured Evidence Package, providing traceable and reproducible support for final conclusions. Experiments show that ChartAgent substantially improves robustness under sparse annotation settings, offering a practical path toward trustworthy and extensible systems for chart understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdChartAgent\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3MLLMs\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u91ca\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u6570\u5b57\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\uff08TIR\uff09\u7684ChartAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u8868\u5206\u6790\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u653e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u5305\u3002", "result": "ChartAgent\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u91ca\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ChartAgent\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

While this transformation improves performance, it significantly impacts static features such as machine instructions and control flow graphs, which are crucial to binary analysis. Yet, despite its broad impact, the security impact of function inlining remains underexplored to date. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of function inlining through the lens of machine learning-based binary analysis. To this end, we dissect the inlining decision pipeline within the LLVM's cost model and explore the combinations of the compiler options that aggressively promote the function inlining ratio beyond standard optimization levels, which we term extreme inlining. We focus on five ML-assisted binary analysis tasks for security, using 20 unique models to systematically evaluate their robustness under extreme inlining scenarios. Our extensive experiments reveal several significant findings: i) function inlining, though a benign transformation in intent, can (in)directly affect ML model behaviors, being potentially exploited by evading discriminative or generative ML models; ii) ML models relying on static features can be highly sensitive to inlining; iii) subtle compiler settings can be leveraged to deliberately craft evasive binary variants; and iv) inlining ratios vary substantially across applications and build configurations, undermining assumptions of consistency in training and evaluation of ML models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u6790\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u51fd\u6570\u5185\u8054\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51fd\u6570\u5185\u8054\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5185\u8054\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6784\u9020\u89c4\u907f\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4e14\u5185\u8054\u7387\u56e0\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u51fd\u6570\u5185\u8054\u4f18\u5316\u867d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u6790\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5256\u6790LLVM\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u8054\u51b3\u7b56\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u5347\u51fd\u6570\u5185\u8054\u7387\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u9009\u9879\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u6781\u7aef\u5185\u8054\uff09\uff0c\u752820\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5185\u8054\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u51fd\u6570\u5185\u8054\u4f1a\u76f4\u63a5\u6216\u95f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5185\u8054\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6784\u9020\u89c4\u907f\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5185\u8054\u7387\u56e0\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51fd\u6570\u5185\u8054\u867d\u521d\u8877\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u9700\u8003\u8651\u5185\u8054\u7387\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

While existing deep learning methods can provide an accurate quantitative estimation of the T2 parameter, they still require large amounts of training data and lack theoretical support and a recognized gold standard. Thus, given the absence of PINN-based approaches for T2 estimation, we propose embedding the fundamental physics of MRI, the Bloch equation, in the loss of PINN, which is solely based on target scan data and does not require a pre-defined training database. Furthermore, by deriving rigorous upper bounds for both the T2 estimation error and the generalization error of the Bloch equation solution, we establish a theoretical foundation for evaluating the PINN's quantitative accuracy. Even without access to the ground truth or a gold standard, this theory enables us to estimate the error with respect to the real quantitative parameter T2. The accuracy of T2 mapping and the validity of the theoretical analysis are demonstrated on a numerical cardiac model and a water phantom, where our method exhibits excellent quantitative precision in the myocardial T2 range.

This dissertation posits that a systematic, hierarchical approach is essential to overcome these challenges, achieving the robust scalability at the representation, architecture, and system levels. At the representation level, we investigate methods for building a unified model that learns audio-visual features inherently robust to diverse real-world corruptions, thereby enabling generalization to new environments without specialized modules. To address architectural scalability, we explore how to efficiently expand model capacity while ensuring the adaptive and reliable use of multimodal inputs, developing a framework that intelligently allocates computational resources based on the input characteristics. Finally, at the system level, we present methods to expand the system's functionality through modular integration with large-scale foundation models, leveraging their powerful cognitive and generative capabilities to maximize final recognition accuracy. By systematically providing solutions at each of these three levels, this dissertation aims to build a next-generation, robust, and scalable AVSR system with high reliability in real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u9c81\u68d2\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89c6\u542c\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff08AVSR\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ece\u8868\u793a\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4AVSR\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e72\u6270\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89c6\u542c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u5f00\u53d1\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u96c6\u6210\u6269\u5c55\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3AVSR\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents.

This challenge directly hinders the practical adoption of topological data analysis in many applications, where automated and reliable interpretation of persistence diagrams is essential for downstream decision-making. In this paper, we study automatic significance detection for one-dimensional persistence diagrams. Specifically, we propose Topology Understanding Net (TUN), a multi-modal network that combines enhanced PD descriptors with self-attention, a PointNet-style point cloud encoder, learned fusion, and per-point classification, alongside stable preprocessing and imbalance-aware training. It provides an automated and effective solution for identifying significant points in PDs, which are critical for downstream applications.

This study developed and validated the Trust in AI-Generated Health Advice (TAIGHA) scale and its four-item short form (TAIGHA-S) as theory-based instruments measuring trust and distrust, each with cognitive and affective components. The items were developed using a generative AI approach, followed by content validation with 10 domain experts, face validation with 30 lay participants, and psychometric validation with 385 UK participants who received AI-generated advice in a symptom-assessment scenario. After automated item reduction, 28 items were retained and reduced to 10 based on expert ratings. TAIGHA showed excellent content validity (S-CVI/Ave=0.99) and CFA confirmed a two-factor model with excellent fit (CFI=0.98, TLI=0.98, RMSEA=0.07, SRMR=0.03). Internal consistency was high (\u03b1=0.95). Convergent validity was supported by correlations with the Trust in Automated Systems Survey (r=0.67/-0.66) and users' reliance on the AI's advice (r=0.37 for trust), while divergent validity was supported by low correlations with reading flow and mental load (all |r|<0.25). TAIGHA-S correlated highly with the full scale (r=0.96) and showed good reliability (\u03b1=0.88).

Failure to maintain these requirements often results in delayed or lost control signals, reduced operational efficiency, and increased risk of wind turbine generator downtime.\n  To address these challenges, this study proposes a threshold-triggered Deep Q-Network self-healing agent that autonomically detects, analyzes, and mitigates network disruptions while adapting routing behavior and resource allocation in real time. The proposed agent was trained, validated, and tested on an emulated tri-clustered switch network deployed in a cloud-based proof-of-concept testbed.\n  Simulation results show that the proposed agent improves disruption recovery performance by 53.84% compared to a baseline shortest-path and load-balanced routing approach and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System by 13.1% and the Deep Q-Network and traffic prediction-based routing optimization method by 21.5%, in a super-spine leaf data-plane architecture.\n  Additionally, the agent maintains switch thermal stability by proactively initiating external rack cooling when required.

Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations. Furthermore, we introduce the Immunization Success Rate (ISR), a novel metric designed to rigorously quantify true immunization efficacy for the first time. ISR quantifies the proportion of edits where immunization induces either semantic failure relative to the prompt or significant perceptual degradations, assessed via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

DANP functions over multiple timesteps to manipulate both cross-attention maps and the noise prediction process, using a dynamic threshold to generate masks that identify text-relevant and irrelevant regions. It then reduces attention in relevant areas while increasing it in irrelevant ones, thereby misguides the edit towards incorrect regions and preserves the intended targets.

Building on this framework, we demonstrated that online monitoring of the count of specific steps can produce effective interpretable early stopping criteria of LRM inferences. We evaluate the Step-tagging framework on three open-source reasoning models across standard benchmark datasets: MATH500, GSM8K, AIME and non-mathematical tasks (GPQA and MMLU-Pro).

BATADAL benchmark data is a good source of testing intrusion detection techniques, but it presents several important problems, such as imbalance in the number of classes, multivariate time dependence, and stealthy attacks. We consider a hybrid ensemble learning model that will enhance the detection ability of cyber-attacks in WDS by using the complementary capabilities of machine learning and deep learning models. Three base learners, namely, Random Forest , eXtreme Gradient Boosting , and Long Short-Term Memory network, have been strictly compared and seven ensemble types using simple averaged and stacked learning with a logistic regression meta-learner. Random Forest analysis identified top predictors turned into temporal and statistical features, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to overcome the class imbalance issue.

Due to the limited availability of richly annotated music datasets, much of the progress in AMT has been concentrated on classical piano music, and even a few very specific datasets. Whether these systems can generalize effectively to other musical contexts remains an open question. Complementing recent studies on distribution shifts in sound (e.g., recording conditions), in this work we investigate the musical dimension -- specifically, variations in genre, dynamics, and polyphony levels. To this end, we introduce the MDS corpus, comprising three distinct subsets -- (1) Genre, (2) Random, and (3) MAEtest -- to emulate different axes of distribution shift. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art AMT systems on the MDS corpus using both traditional information-retrieval and musically-informed performance metrics. Our extensive evaluation isolates and exposes varying degrees of performance degradation under specific distribution shifts. In particular, we measure a note-level F1 performance drop of 20 percentage points due to sound, and 14 due to genre. Generally, we find that dynamics estimation proves more vulnerable to musical variation than onset prediction. Musically informed evaluation metrics, particularly those capturing harmonic structure, help identify potential contributing factors. Furthermore, experiments with randomly generated, non-musical sequences reveal clear limitations in system performance under extreme musical distribution shifts. Altogether, these findings offer new evidence of the persistent impact of the Corpus Bias problem in deep AMT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76AMT\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u97f3\u4e50\u8bed\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165MDS\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u97f3\u4e50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\uff0cAMT\u8fdb\u5c55\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u53e4\u5178\u94a2\u7434\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u97f3\u4e50\u8bed\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MDS\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u8f74\uff0c\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e2aAMT\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5982\u58f0\u97f3\u548c\u6d41\u6d3e\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4F1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bd4\u8d77\u59cb\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u6613\u53d7\u97f3\u4e50\u53d8\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6AMT\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

However, robust image caption evaluation using LVLMs remains challenging, particularly under domain-shift scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce the Distribution-Aware Score Decoder (DISCODE), a novel finetuning-free method that generates robust evaluation scores better aligned with human judgments across diverse domains. The core idea behind DISCODE lies in its test-time adaptive evaluation approach, which introduces the Adaptive Test-Time (ATT) loss, leveraging a Gaussian prior distribution to improve robustness in evaluation score estimation.

Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages.

While existing adversarial attacks primarily focus on content falsification or instruction injection, we identify a novel, process-oriented attack surface: the agent's reasoning style. We propose Reasoning-Style Poisoning (RSP), a paradigm that manipulates how agents process information rather than what they process. We introduce Generative Style Injection (GSI), an attack method that rewrites retrieved documents into pathological tones--specifically \"analysis paralysis\" or \"cognitive haste\"--without altering underlying facts or using explicit triggers. To quantify these shifts, we develop the Reasoning Style Vector (RSV), a metric tracking Verification depth, Self-confidence, and Attention focus. Experiments on HotpotQA and FEVER using ReAct, Reflection, and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) architectures reveal that GSI significantly degrades performance. It increases reasoning steps by up to 4.4 times or induces premature errors, successfully bypassing state-of-the-art content filters.

Regular inspections are required to ensure their safety, yet traditional manual procedures are time-consuming, subjective, and costly. Recent advances in mobile mapping systems and Deep Learning (DL) enable automated visual inspections. However, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of tunnel datasets. This paper introduces a new publicly available dataset containing annotated images of three different tunnel linings, capturing typical defects: cracks, leaching, and water infiltration.

In this paper, we present a unified formulation of different non-parametric quantization methods through the lens of lattice coding.

As a step forward, we explore a few possible candidates, including random lattices, generalized Fibonacci lattices, and densest sphere packing lattices. Among all, we find the Leech lattice-based quantization method, which is dubbed as Spherical Leech Quantization ($\u039b_{24}$-SQ), leads to both a simplified training recipe and an improved reconstruction-compression tradeoff thanks to its high symmetry and even distribution on the hypersphere. In image tokenization and compression tasks, this quantization approach achieves better reconstruction quality across all metrics than BSQ, the best prior art, while consuming slightly fewer bits.

In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for MIL methods, inspired by proceedings in Neural Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers. Instead of relying on complex attention-based aggregation, we propose an efficient, aggregator-agnostic framework that removes the complexity of correlation learning from the MIL aggregator. CAPRMIL produces rich context-aware patch embeddings that promote effective correlation learning on downstream tasks. By projecting patch features -- extracted using a frozen patch encoder -- into a small set of global context/morphology-aware tokens and utilizing multi-head self-attention, CAPRMIL injects global context with linear computational complexity with respect to the bag size. Paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator, CAPRMIL matches state-of-the-art slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks, while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by 48%-92.8% versus SOTA MILs, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time.

The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u8d8a\u5357\u6cd5\u5f8b\u57fa\u51c6VLegal - Bench\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d8a\u5357\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8d8a\u5357\u7acb\u6cd5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ed9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8fd0\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d8a\u5357\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u53c2\u7167Bloom\u8ba4\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u6ce8\u91ca\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u621010,450\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7406\u89e3\u5c42\u6b21\u53ca\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6837\u672c\u6743\u5a01\u4e14\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u52a9\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6VLegal - Bench\u3002", "conclusion": "VLegal - Bench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d8a\u5357\u6cd5\u5f8b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7b26\u5408\u9053\u5fb7\u7684AI\u8f85\u52a9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Existing methods predominantly rely on learning robust global representations or implicit feature alignment, which often fail to model explicit spatial correspondences crucial for accurate localization. In this work, we propose a novel correspondence-aware feature refinement framework, termed CLNet, that explicitly bridges the semantic and geometric gaps between different views. CLNet decomposes the view alignment process into three learnable and complementary modules: a Neural Correspondence Map (NCM) that spatially aligns cross-view features via latent correspondence fields; a Nonlinear Embedding Converter (NEC) that remaps features across perspectives using an MLP-based transformation; and a Global Feature Recalibration (GFR) module that reweights informative feature channels guided by learned spatial cues. The proposed CLNet can jointly capture both high-level semantics and fine-grained alignments.

Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429.

To overcome this, we leverage large-scale pretrained models (e.g. CLIP) to proactively probe the feature space, explicitly highlighting distributional gaps between real videos, known forgeries, and unseen manipulations. Specifically, FakeRadar introduces Forgery Outlier Probing, which employs dynamic subcluster modeling and cluster-conditional outlier generation to synthesize outlier samples near boundaries of estimated subclusters, simulating novel forgery artifacts beyond known manipulation types. Additionally, we design Outlier-Guided Tri-Training, which optimizes the detector to distinguish real, fake, and outlier samples using proposed outlier-driven contrastive learning and outlier-conditioned cross-entropy losses. Experiments show that FakeRadar outperforms existing methods across various benchmark datasets for deepfake video detection, particularly in cross-domain evaluations, by handling the variety of emerging manipulation techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFakeRadar\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u77e5\u4f2a\u9020\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4f2a\u9020\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\u63a2\u6d4b\u5408\u6210\u79bb\u7fa4\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e09\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "FakeRadar\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5c24\u5176\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "FakeRadar\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5404\u79cd\u65b0\u5174\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community.

Recent advances in music generation models have enabled diverse editing tasks such as timbre transfer, instrument substitution, and genre transformation. However, many existing works overlook the evaluation of their ability to preserve musical facets that should remain unchanged during editing a property we define as Music Context Preservation (MCP). While some studies do consider MCP, they adopt inconsistent evaluation protocols and metrics, leading to unreliable and unfair comparisons. To address this gap, we introduce the first MCP evaluation benchmark, MuseCPBench, which covers four categories of musical facets and enables comprehensive comparisons across five representative music editing baselines. Through systematic analysis along musical facets, methods, and models, we identify consistent preservation gaps in current music editing methods and provide insightful explanations.

Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges.

This research tackles two major challenges: capturing the subtle expression details present in real human faces, and reconstructing an intricate 3D head avatar from a single portrait image. To accurately model expression details, VASA-3D leverages the motion latent of VASA-1, a method that yields exceptional realism and vividness in 2D talking heads. A critical element of our work is translating this motion latent to 3D, which is accomplished by devising a 3D head model that is conditioned on the motion latent. Customization of this model to a single image is achieved through an optimization framework that employs numerous video frames of the reference head synthesized from the input image. The optimization takes various training losses robust to artifacts and limited pose coverage in the generated training data.

This paper present an approach for learning a structured latent representation from native 3D data to address this challenge. At its core is a new sparse voxel structure called O-Voxel, an omni-voxel representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. O-Voxel can robustly model arbitrary topology, including open, non-manifold, and fully-enclosed surfaces, while capturing comprehensive surface attributes beyond texture color, such as physically-based rendering parameters. Based on O-Voxel, we design a Sparse Compression VAE which provides a high spatial compression rate and a compact latent space. We train large-scale flow-matching models comprising 4B parameters for 3D generation using diverse public 3D asset datasets. Despite their scale, inference remains highly efficient. Meanwhile, the geometry and material quality of our generated assets far exceed those of existing models. We believe our approach offers a significant advancement in 3D generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eO - Voxel\u76843D\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67093D\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d44\u4ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faO - Voxel\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1Sparse Compression VAE\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u542b4B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u7406\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6750\u8d28\u8d28\u91cf\u8fdc\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash.
