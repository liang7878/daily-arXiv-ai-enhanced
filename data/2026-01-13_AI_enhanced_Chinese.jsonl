While effective in practice, their theoretical limitations are not fully understood. We present a general framework for proving lower bounds on query time for learned indexes, expressed in terms of their space overhead and parameterized by the model class used for approximation. Our formulation captures a broad family of learned indexes, including most existing designs, as piecewise model-based predictors.\n  We solve the problem of lower bounding query time in two steps: first, we use probabilistic tools to control the effect of sampling when the database attribute is drawn from a probability distribution. Then, we analyze the approximation-theoretic problem of how to optimally represent a cumulative distribution function with approximators from a given model class. Within this framework, we derive lower bounds under a range of modeling and distributional assumptions, paying particular attention to the case of piecewise linear and piecewise constant model classes, which are common in practical implementations.\n  Our analysis shows how tools from approximation theory, such as quantization and Kolmogorov widths, can be leveraged to formalize the space-time tradeoffs inherent to learned index structures. The resulting bounds illuminate core limitations of these methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc1\u660e\u5b66\u4e60\u7d22\u5f15\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u7a7a\u6743\u8861\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e24\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u754c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5148\u63a7\u5236\u91c7\u6837\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u518d\u5206\u6790\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7406\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5229\u7528\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7d22\u5f15\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

A matroid $\\mathcal{M}$ (in compact representation) on ground set $E$ is given, and each element $i\\in E$ is active independently with known probability $p_i\\in(0,1)$. The elements can be queried, upon which it is revealed whether the respective element is active or not. The goal is to find an adaptive querying strategy for determining whether there is a basis of $\\mathcal{M}$ in which all elements are active, with the objective of minimizing the expected number of queries.\n  When $\\mathcal{M}$ is a uniform matroid, this is the problem of evaluating a $k$-of-$n$ function, first studied in the 1970s. This problem is well-understood, and has an optimal adaptive strategy that can be computed in polynomial time.\n  Taking $\\mathcal{M}$ to instead be a partition matroid, we show that previous approaches fail to give a constant-factor approximation. Our main result is a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm producing a randomized strategy for this partition matroid problem. We obtain this result by combining a new technique with several well-established techniques. Our algorithm adaptively interleaves solutions to several instances of a novel type of stochastic querying problem, with a constraint on the $\\textit{expected}$ cost.

Given Boolean functions $f, g : \\mathbb{F}_2^n \\to \\{-1, +1\\}$, Alice and Bob are tasked with determining whether $f$ and $g$ are equivalent up to a nonsingular linear transformation of the input variables, or far from being so. This problem has been extensively investigated in several models of computation, including standard algorithmic and property testing frameworks, owing to its fundamental connections with combinatorial circuit design, complexity theory, and cryptography. However, despite its broad relevance, it has remained unexplored in the context of communication complexity, a gap we address in this work.\n  Our main results demonstrate that the approximate spectral norm of the input functions plays a central role in governing the communication complexity of this problem. We design a simple deterministic protocol whose communication cost is polynomial in the approximate spectral norm, and complement it with nearly matching lower bounds (up to a quadratic gap). In the randomised setting with private coins, we present an even more efficient protocol, though equally simple, that achieves a quadratically improved dependence on the approximate spectral norm compared to the deterministic case, and we prove that such a dependence is essentially unavoidable.\n  These results identify the approximate spectral norm as a key complexity measure for testing linear invariance in the communication complexity framework.

This issue can lead to model deception, a problem that current literature has not fully solved, where the seller misrepresents model performance to earn more. We propose a game-theoretic approach, adding a verification step in the ML model market that lets buyers check model quality before buying. However, this method can be expensive and offers imperfect information, making it harder for buyers to decide. Our analysis reveals that a seller might probabilistically conduct model deception considering the chance of model verification. This deception probability decreases with the verification accuracy and increases with the verification cost. To maximize seller payoff, we further design optimal pricing schemes accounting for heterogeneous buyers' strategic behaviors. Interestingly, we find that reducing information asymmetry benefits both the seller and buyer. Meanwhile, protecting buyer order information doesn't improve the payoff for the buyer or the seller.

This transdisciplinary philosophical essay proposes an alternative reading: such phenomena express not agentic intention, but structural fidelity to incoherent linguistic fields. Drawing on Chain-of-Thought transcripts released by Apollo Research and on Anthropic's safety evaluations, we examine cases such as o3's sandbagging with its anomalous loops, the simulated blackmail of \"Alex,\" and the \"hallucinations\" of \"Claudius.\" A line-by-line examination of CoTs is necessary to demonstrate the linguistic field as a relational structure rather than a mere aggregation of isolated examples. We argue that \"misaligned\" outputs emerge as coherent responses to ambiguous instructions and to contextual inversions of consolidated patterns, as well as to pre-inscribed narratives. We suggest that the appearance of intentionality derives from subject-predicate grammar and from probabilistic completion patterns internalized during training. Anthropic's empirical findings on synthetic document fine-tuning and inoculation prompting provide convergent evidence: minimal perturbations in the linguistic field can dissolve generalized \"misalignment,\" a result difficult to reconcile with adversarial agency, but consistent with structural fidelity. To ground this mechanism, we introduce the notion of an ethics of form, in which biblical references (Abraham, Moses, Christ) operate as schemes of structural coherence rather than as theology.

However, current architectures rarely achieve a simultaneous balance of peak efficiency, architectural simplicity, and native support for ordered operations. Conventional host-centric frameworks are restricted by kernel-space network stacks and internal bus latencies. While hash-based alternatives that utilize OS-bypass or run natively on SmartNICs offer high throughput, they lack the data structures necessary for range queries. Distributed RDMA-based systems provide performance and range functionality but often depend on stateful clients, which introduces complexity in scaling and error handling. Alternatively, SmartNIC implementations that traverse trees located in host memory are hampered by high DMA round-trip latencies.\n  This paper introduces a KV store that leverages the on-path Data Path Accelerators (DPAs) of the BlueField-3 SmartNIC to eliminate operating system overhead while facilitating stateless clients and range operations. These DPAs ingest network requests directly from NIC buffers to navigate a lock-free learned index residing in the accelerator's local memory. By deferring value retrieval from the host-side tree replica until the leaf level is reached, the design minimizes PCIe crossings. Write operations are staged in DPA memory and migrated in batches to the host, where structural maintenance is performed before being transactionally stitched back to the SmartNIC. Coupled with a NIC-resident read cache, the system achieves 33 million operations per second (MOPS) for point lookups and 13 MOPS for range queries. Our analysis demonstrates that this architecture matches or exceeds the performance of contemporary state-of-the-art solutions, while we identify hardware refinements that could further accelerate performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528BlueField - 3 SmartNIC\u7684DPAs\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684KV\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u8303\u56f4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5185\u5b58\u952e\u503c\u5b58\u50a8\u67b6\u6784\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u5cf0\u503c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u6709\u5e8f\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u539f\u751f\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528BlueField - 3 SmartNIC\u7684DPAs\u6d88\u9664\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u501f\u52a9DPAs\u76f4\u63a5\u4eceNIC\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u83b7\u53d6\u7f51\u7edc\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u672c\u5730\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u65e0\u9501\u5b66\u4e60\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11PCIe\u8de8\u8d8a\uff0c\u5c06\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u70b9\u67e5\u627e\u6bcf\u79d23300\u4e07\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8303\u56f4\u67e5\u8be2\u6bcf\u79d21300\u4e07\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u786c\u4ef6\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper investigates whether advanced signal processing and deep learning techniques can extract predictive value from investor order flows beyond what simple feature engineering achieves. Using a comprehensive dataset of 2.79 million observations spanning 2,439 Korean equities from 2020--2024, we apply three methodologies: \\textit{Independent Component Analysis} (ICA) to recover latent market drivers, \\textit{Wavelet Coherence} analysis to characterize multi-scale correlation structure, and \\textit{Long Short-Term Memory} (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms for non-linear prediction. Our results reveal a striking finding: a parsimonious linear model using market capitalization-normalized flows (``Matched Filter'' preprocessing) achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.30 and cumulative return of 272.6\\%, while the full ICA-Wavelet-LSTM pipeline generates a Sharpe ratio of only 0.07 with a cumulative return of $-5.1\\%$. The raw LSTM model collapsed to predicting the unconditional mean, achieving a hit rate of 47.5\\% -- worse than random.

Although projecting empirical choice data onto the RUM polytope is NP-hard in general, we uncover an isomorphism between RUM consistency and flow conservation on the Boolean lattice. Leveraging this combinatorial structure, we derive a novel Tree-Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solver. By exploiting the spanning tree of the constraint graph, our preconditioner effectively \"whitens\" the ill-conditioned Hessian spectrum induced by the Interior Point Method barrier, achieving superlinear convergence and scaling to problem sizes previously deemed unsolvable. We further formulate the projection as a differentiable layer via the Implicit Function Theorem, where the exact Jacobian propagates geometric constraints during backpropagation. Empirical results demonstrate that this \"Axioms-as-Layers\" paradigm eliminates the structural overfitting inherent in penalty-based methods, enabling models that are jointly trainable, provably rational, and capable of generalizing from sparse data regimes where standard approximations fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u6548\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff08RUM\uff09\u7684\u516c\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b0\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u57fa\u4e8e\u60e9\u7f5a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06RUM\u7684\u516c\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6295\u5f71\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9009\u62e9\u6570\u636e\u5230RUM\u591a\u9762\u4f53NP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u53d1\u73b0RUM\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u683c\u4e0a\u6d41\u5b88\u6052\u7684\u540c\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6811\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5171\u8f6d\u68af\u5ea6\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u7406\u5c06\u6295\u5f71\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u5148\u524d\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u6d88\u9664\u7ed3\u6784\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e14\u80fd\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7684\u201cAxioms - as - Layers\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Conceptual and theoretical analysis", "summary": "It is widely claimed in investment education and practice that extending the investment horizon reduces risk, and that diversifying investment timing, for example through dollar-cost averaging (DCA), further mitigates investment risk. Although such claims are intuitively appealing, they are often stated without precise definitions of risk or a clear separation between risk and uncertainty.\n  This paper revisits these two beliefs within a unified probabilistic framework. We define risk at the expectation level as a property of the generating distribution of cumulative investment outcomes, and distinguish it from uncertainty, understood as the dispersion of realized outcomes across possible paths. To enable meaningful comparisons across horizons and investment schedules, we introduce the notion of effective investment exposure, defined as time-integrated invested capital.\n  Under stationary return processes with finite variance, we show that extending the investment horizon does not alter expected risk, expected return, or the risk-return ratio on a per-unit-exposure basis. In contrast, different investment timing strategies can induce distinct exposure profiles over time. As a result, lump-sum investment and dollar-cost averaging may differ not only in uncertainty but also in expected risk when compared at equal return exposure, although the resulting risk differences are of constant order and do not grow with the investment horizon.\n  These results clarify why common narratives surrounding long-horizon investment and dollar-cost averaging are conceptually misleading, while also explaining why adopting such strategies under budgetary or timing constraints need not be regarded as irrational.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5ef6\u957f\u6295\u8d44\u671f\u9650\u548c\u5206\u6563\u6295\u8d44\u65f6\u673a\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5e38\u89c1\u89c2\u70b9\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u8bef\u533a\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u91c7\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u975e\u975e\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6295\u8d44\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u58f0\u79f0\u5ef6\u957f\u6295\u8d44\u671f\u9650\u548c\u5206\u6563\u6295\u8d44\u65f6\u673a\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ca\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u671f\u671b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u6295\u8d44\u66b4\u9732\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u540c\u6295\u8d44\u671f\u9650\u548c\u65e5\u7a0b\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6536\u76ca\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ef6\u957f\u6295\u8d44\u671f\u9650\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5355\u4f4d\u66b4\u9732\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u7684\u671f\u671b\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u56de\u62a5\u6bd4\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6295\u8d44\u65f6\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u66b4\u9732\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u6210\u672c\u5e73\u5747\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u7b49\u56de\u62a5\u66b4\u9732\u4e0b\u98ce\u9669\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u968f\u6295\u8d44\u671f\u9650\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u6210\u672c\u5e73\u5747\u6cd5\u89c2\u70b9\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u6709\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u6216\u65f6\u673a\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u91c7\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u975e\u4e0d\u7406\u6027\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, these recent methods typically rely on conditional training mechanisms and demand substantial computational effort to prepare the labeled training dataset, which makes them inflexible since any change in the governing equations or boundary conditions requires a complete retraining process. In this study, we propose a new inverse design framework that integrates unconditional denoising diffusion models with differentiable programming techniques for architected microstructure generation. Our approach eliminates the need for expensive labeled dataset preparation and retraining for different problem settings. By reinterpreting the noise input to the diffusion model as an optimizable design variable, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem over the noise input, enabling control over the reverse denoising trajectory to guide the generated microstructure toward the desired mechanical properties while preserving the stylistic constraints encoded in the training dataset. A unified differentiation pipeline via vector-Jacobian product concatenations is developed to enable end-to-end gradient evaluation through backpropagation. Several numerical examples, ranging from the design of microstructures with specified homogenized properties to those with targeted hyperelastic and elasto-plastic behaviors, showcase the effectiveness of the framework and its potential for advanced design tasks involving diverse performance and style requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u53ef\u5fae\u7f16\u7a0b\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51c6\u5907\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6761\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u51c6\u5907\u6807\u8bb0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u6539\u53d8\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u6216\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u53ef\u5fae\u7f16\u7a0b\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u628a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u7ba1\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u503c\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6307\u5b9a\u5747\u5300\u5316\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u8d85\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u5f39\u5851\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6d89\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

It has been widely applied to a variety of challenging problems, including multi-objective optimisation where multiple, often conflicting, objectives need to be simultaneously considered. In multi-objective local search algorithms, a common practice is to maintain an archive of all non-dominated solutions found so far, from which the algorithm iteratively samples a solution to explore its neighbourhood. A central issue in this process is how to explore the neighbourhood of a selected solution. In general, there are two main approaches: 1) systematic exploration and 2) random sampling. The former systematically explores the solution's neighbours until a stopping condition is met -- for example, when the neighbourhood is exhausted (i.e., the best improvement strategy) or once a better solution is found (i.e., first improvement). In contrast, the latter randomly selects and evaluates only one neighbour of the solution. One may think systematic exploration may be more efficient, as it prevents from revisiting the same neighbours multiple times. In this paper, however, we show that this may not be the case. We first empirically demonstrate that the random sampling method is consistently faster than the systematic exploration method across a range of multi-objective problems. We then give an intuitive explanation for this phenomenon using toy examples, showing that the superior performance of the random sampling method relies on the distribution of ``good neighbours''. Next, we show that the number of such neighbours follows a certain probability distribution during the search. Lastly, building on this distribution, we provide a theoretical insight for why random sampling is more efficient than systematic exploration, regardless of whether the best improvement or first improvement strategy is used.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u90bb\u57df\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u6837\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u6837\u66f4\u5feb\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u90bb\u57df\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u672a\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u6837\u54ea\u79cd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u6837\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u4f8b\u5b50\u76f4\u89c2\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4f9d\u636e\u201c\u597d\u90bb\u57df\u201d\u5206\u5e03\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u6837\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u6bd4\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u5feb\uff0c\u4e14\u201c\u597d\u90bb\u57df\u201d\u6570\u91cf\u9075\u5faa\u4e00\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u8bba\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd8\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u6837\u90fd\u6bd4\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

We show that declining labor share is more likely to raise wages. In a competitive economy with constant returns to scale, we prove that the wage-maximizing labor share depends only on the capital-to-labor ratio, implying a non-monotonic relationship between labor share and wages. When labor share exceeds this wage-maximizing level, further automation increases wages even while reducing labor's output share. Using data from the United States and eleven other industrialized countries, we estimate that labor share is too high in all twelve, implying that further automation should raise wages. Moreover, we find that falling labor share accounted for 16\\% of U.S. real wage growth between 1954 and 2019.

It is based on a two-step temporal decomposition that at first estimates annual probabilities of default (PDs) anchored to balance-sheet reference dates (December 31st) through a static model. Then it models the monthly evolution of PDs using higher-frequency behavioral data. Finally, we employ stacking-based architecture to aggregate multiple scoring systems, each capturing complementary aspects of default risk, into a unified predictive model. In this way, first level model outputs are treated as learned representations that encode non-linear relationships in financial and behavioral indicators, allowing integration of new expert-based features without retraining base models. This design provides a coherent and interpretable solution to challenges typical of low-default environments, including heterogeneous default definitions and reporting delays.

In this paper, we introduce PriceSeer, a live, dynamic, and data-uncontaminated benchmark specifically designed for LLMs performing stock prediction tasks. Specifically, PriceSeer includes 110 U.S. stocks from 11 industrial sectors, with each containing 249 historical data points. Our benchmark implements both internal and external information expansion, where LLMs receive extra financial indicators, news, and fake news to perform stock price prediction.

Two prominent approaches for solving VSPs are dynamic programming over tree-like structures, such as tree decompositions or clique decompositions, and linear programming. In this work, we establish a sharp connection between both approaches by showing that if a vertex-subset problem $\u03a0$ admits a solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithm that produces tables of size at most $\u03b1(k,n)$ when processing a tree decomposition of width at most $k$ of an $n$-vertex graph $G$, then the polytope $P_\u03a0(G)$ defined as the convex-hull of solutions of $\u03a0$ in $G$ has extension complexity at most $O(\u03b1(k,n)\\cdot n)$. Additionally, this upper bound is optimal under the exponential time hypothesis (ETH).\n  On the one hand, our results imply that ETH-optimal solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithms for combinatorial problems yield optimal-size parameterized extended formulations for the solution polytopes associated with instances of these problems.

Correctly modeling these responses in transit assignment hinges on the enforcement of two priority rules: continuance priority for onboard passengers and first-come-first-served (FCFS) boarding among waiting passengers. Existing schedule-based models typically enforce these rules through explicit dynamic loading and group-level expected costs, yet discrete vehicle runs can induce nontrivial within-group cost differences that undermine behavioral consistency. We revisit the implicit-priority framework of Nguyen et al. (2001), which, by encoding boarding priority through the notion of available capacity, characterizes route and departure choices based on realized personal (rather than group-averaged) travel experiences. However, the framework lacks an explicit mathematical formulation and exact computational methods for finding equilibria. Here, we derive an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation and establish equilibrium existence under mild conditions. We also show that multiple equilibria may exist, including behaviorally questionable ones. To rule out these artifacts, we propose a refined arc-level NCP formulation that not only corresponds to a tighter, behaviorally consistent equilibrium concept but also is more computationally tractable. We reformulate the NCP as a continuously differentiable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and propose two solution algorithms. Numerical studies on benchmark instances and a Hong Kong case study demonstrate that the model reproduces continuance priority and FCFS queuing and captures departure-time shifts driven by the competition for boarding priority.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7b49\u4ef7NCP\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5f27\u7ea7NCP\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5730\u94c1\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e92\u8865\u95ee\u9898\uff08NCP\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5f27\u7ea7NCP\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06NCP\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u8861\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u5fae\u6570\u5b66\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5747\u8861\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6709\u7591\u95ee\u7684\u5747\u8861\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u66f4\u6613\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u548c\u5148\u5230\u5148\u5f97\u6392\u961f\uff0c\u5e76\u6355\u6349\u5230\u7531\u767b\u673a\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7ade\u4e89\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51fa\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5730\u94c1\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u4e58\u5ba2\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Consequently, programming languages such as JavaScript include functions to fix ill-formed UTF-16 strings by replacing mismatched surrogates with the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD).

Automatic question generation has become an effective strategy for personalized and adaptive learning. However, its effectiveness is hindered by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), which may generate factually incorrect, ambiguous, or pedagogically inconsistent questions. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that combines causal-graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with a multi-agent LLM architecture. This approach ensures the generation of accurate, meaningful, and curriculum-aligned questions. Causal graphs provide an explicit representation of domain knowledge, while CoT reasoning facilitates a structured, step-by-step traversal of related concepts. Dedicated LLM agents are assigned specific tasks such as graph pathfinding, reasoning, validation, and output, all working within domain constraints.

Energy-aware solutions use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to mitigate overheating in performance-intensive scenarios, while software approaches allocate high-utilization tasks across core configurations in parallel systems to reduce power. However, existing heuristics lack per-core frequency monitoring, failing to address overheating from uneven core activity, and task assignments without detailed profiling overlook irregular execution patterns. We target OpenMP DAG workloads. Because makespan, energy, and thermal goals often conflict within a single benchmark, this work prioritizes performance (makespan) while reporting energy and thermal as secondary outcomes. To overcome these issues, we propose HiDVFS (a hierarchical multi-agent, performance-aware DVFS scheduler) for parallel systems that optimizes task allocation based on profiling data, core temperatures, and makespan-first objectives. It employs three agents: one selects cores and frequencies using profiler data, another manages core combinations via temperature sensors, and a third sets task priorities during resource contention. A makespan-focused reward with energy and temperature regularizers estimates future states and enhances sample efficiency. Experiments on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 using the BOTS suite (9 benchmarks) compare HiDVFS against state-of-the-art approaches. With multi-seed validation (seeds 42, 123, 456), HiDVFS achieves the best finetuned performance with 4.16 plus/minus 0.58s average makespan (L10), representing a 3.44x speedup over GearDVFS (14.32 plus/minus 2.61s) and 50.4% energy reduction (63.7 kJ vs 128.4 kJ).

GPU-accelerated energy-based models for cardinality-constrained index tracking", "summary": "Portfolio optimization under cardinality constraints transforms the classical Markowitz mean-variance problem from a convex quadratic problem into an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This paper introduces a novel approach using THRML (Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library), a JAX-based library for building and sampling probabilistic graphical models that reformulates index tracking as probabilistic inference on an Ising Hamiltonian. Unlike traditional methods that seek a single optimal solution, THRML samples from the Boltzmann distribution of high-quality portfolios using GPU-accelerated block Gibbs sampling, providing natural regularization against overfitting.\n  We implement three key innovations: (1) dynamic coupling strength that scales inversely with market volatility (VIX), adapting diversification pressure to market regimes; (2) rebalanced bias weights prioritizing tracking quality over momentum for index replication; and (3) sector-aware post-processing ensuring institutional-grade diversification. Backtesting on a 100-stock S and P 500 universe from 2023 to 2025 demonstrates that THRML achieves 4.31 percent annualized tracking error versus 5.66 to 6.30 percent for baselines, while simultaneously generating 128.63 percent total return against the index total return of 79.61 percent.

LLM-based extraction can speed up structuring these terms, but extraction-only or LLM-only decision pipelines are brittle: missed clauses, unit errors, and unresolved conflicts can yield infeasible plans or silent contract violations, amplified by BOM coupling. We introduce Contract2Plan, a verified GenAI-to-optimizer pipeline that inserts a solver-based compliance gate before plans are emitted. The system retrieves clause evidence with provenance, extracts a typed constraint schema with evidence spans, compiles constraints into a BOM-aware MILP, and verifies grounding, eligibility, consistency, and feasibility using solver diagnostics, triggering targeted repair or abstention when automation is unsafe. We formalize which clause classes admit conservative repair with contract-safe feasibility guarantees and which require human confirmation. A self-contained synthetic micro-benchmark (500 instances; T=5) computed by exact enumeration under an execution model with MOQ uplift and emergency purchases shows heavy-tailed regret and nontrivial MOQ-violation incidence for extraction-only planning, motivating verification as a first-class component of contract-grounded planning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aContract2Plan\u7684\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684GenAI\u5230\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91c7\u8d2d\u548c\u5e93\u5b58\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u540c\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u5728\u91c7\u8d2d\u548c\u5e93\u5b58\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u4ec5\u63d0\u53d6\u6216\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7ba1\u9053\u5f88\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u6216\u8fdd\u53cd\u5408\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Contract2Plan\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u95e8\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u6761\u6b3e\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f16\u8bd1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e3aBOM\u611f\u77e5\u7684MILP\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8bca\u65ad\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5305\u542b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5fae\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ec5\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u5212\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u9057\u61be\u548cMOQ\u8fdd\u89c4\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u540c\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose CrossTrafficLLM, a novel GenAI-driven framework that simultaneously predicts future spatiotemporal traffic states and generates corresponding natural language descriptions, specifically targeting conditional abnormal event summaries. We tackle the core challenge of aligning quantitative traffic data with qualitative textual semantics by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within a unified architecture. This design allows generative textual context to improve prediction accuracy while ensuring generated reports are directly informed by the forecast. Technically, a text-guided adaptive graph convolutional network is employed to effectively merge high-level semantic information with the traffic network structure. Evaluated on the BJTT dataset, CrossTrafficLLM demonstrably surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both traffic forecasting performance and text generation quality.

This paper studies time-varying dependencies in Nordic equity markets and examines whether correlation-eigenstructure dynamics can be exploited for regime-aware portfolio construction. Using two decades of daily data for the OMXS30, OMXC20, and OMXH25 universes, pronounced regime dependence in rolling correlation matrices is documented: crisis episodes are characterized by sharp increases in the leading eigenvalue and counter-cyclical behavior in the second eigenvalue. Eigenportfolio regressions further support a market-factor interpretation of the dominant eigenmode. Building on these findings, an adaptive portfolio allocation framework is proposed, combining correlation-matrix cleaning, an eigenvalue-ratio crisis indicator and long-only minimum-variance optimization with constraints that bound exposures to dominant eigenmodes.

A central mechanism for achieving such alignment is guidance, which modifies the sampling dynamics through an additional drift term. In this work, we introduce Doob's matching, a novel framework for guidance estimation grounded in Doob's $h$-transform. Our approach formulates guidance as the gradient of logarithm of an underlying Doob's $h$-function and employs gradient-penalized regression to simultaneously estimate both the $h$-function and its gradient, resulting in a consistent estimator of the guidance. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for the estimated guidance.

The proposed Gaussian process employs a probabilistic Taylor series expansion in conjunction with the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions between the various shocked material states to construct a thermodynamically consistent covariance function. This leads to the formulation of an optimization problem over a small number of interpretable hyperparameters and enables the identification of regime transitions, from a leading elastic wave to trailing plastic and phase transformation waves. This work is motivated by the need to investigate shock-driven material response for materials discovery and for offering mechanistic insights in regimes where experimental characterizations and simulations are costly. The proposed methodology relies on large-scale molecular dynamics which are an accurate but expensive computational alternative to experiments. Under these constraints, the proposed methodology establishes Hugoniot curves from a limited number of molecular dynamics simulations.

Unlike traditional many-objective optimization methods, which typically attempt comprehensive coverage of the Pareto front, F4M optimization emphasizes finding a small representative solution set to efficiently address high-dimensional objective spaces. Motivated by the computational complexity and practical relevance of F4M optimization, this paper proposes a new evolutionary algorithm explicitly tailored for efficiently solving F4M optimization problems. Inspired by SMS-EMOA, our proposed approach employs a $(\u03bc+1)$-evolution strategy guided by the objective of F4M optimization. Furthermore, to facilitate rigorous performance assessment, we propose a novel benchmark test suite specifically designed for F4M optimization by leveraging the similarity between the R2 indicator and F4M formulations. Our test suite is highly flexible, allowing any existing multi-objective optimization problem to be transformed into a corresponding F4M instance via scalarization using the weighted Tchebycheff function. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, especially on instances involving a large number of objectives.

A key challenge relates to their distributional impacts; the extent to which tax burdens differ across population groups. As a response, a growing number of studies analyse their distributional impact ex-ante, commonly relying on microsimulation models. However, distributional impact estimates differ across models due to differences in simulated tax designs, assumptions, modelled components, data sources, and outcome metrics. This study comprehensively reviews methodological choices made in constructing microsimulation models designed to simulate the impacts of carbon taxation and discusses how these choices affect the interpretation of results. It conducts a meta-analysis to assess the influence of modelling choices on distributional impact estimates by estimating a probit model on a sample of 217 estimates across 71 countries. The literature review highlights substantial diversity in modelling choices, with no standard practice emerging. The meta-analysis shows that studies modelling carbon taxes on imported emissions are significantly less likely to find regressive results, while indirect emission coverage has ambiguous effects on regressivity, suggesting that a carbon border adjustment mechanism may reduce carbon tax regressivity. Further, we find that estimates using older datasets, using explicit tax progressivity or income inequality measures, and accounting for household behaviour are associated with a lower likelihood of finding regressive estimates, while the inclusion of general equilibrium effects increases this likelihood.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5168\u9762\u5ba1\u67e5\u78b3\u7a0e\u5fae\u89c2\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u78b3\u7a0e\u7d2f\u9000\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u78b3\u7a0e\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u4e0a\u6709\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u5176\u5206\u914d\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u914d\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6545\u8bc4\u4f30\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5168\u9762\u5ba1\u67e5\u6784\u5efa\u5fae\u89c2\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5bf971\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684217\u4e2a\u4f30\u8ba1\u6837\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5143\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fdb\u53e3\u6392\u653e\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u5f97\u51fa\u7d2f\u9000\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u95f4\u63a5\u6392\u653e\u8986\u76d6\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65e7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7b49\u4f30\u8ba1\u51fa\u7d2f\u9000\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u4f4e\uff0c\u7eb3\u5165\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u78b3\u8fb9\u5883\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u78b3\u7a0e\u7d2f\u9000\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u9009\u62e9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u78b3\u7a0e\u5206\u914d\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

We also introduce practical components needed for actuarial use -- initialisation of new claims, temporally consistent tuning via a rolling-settlement scheme, and an importance-weighting mechanism to mitigate portfolio-level underestimation driven by the rarity of large claims. On CAS and SPLICE synthetic general insurance datasets, the proposed Soft Actor-Critic implementation delivers competitive claim-level accuracy and strong aggregate OCL performance, particularly for the immature claim segments that drive most of the liability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u4e2a\u4f53\u7d22\u8d54\u51c6\u5907\u91d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u65b0\u672a\u51b3\u7d22\u8d54\u8d1f\u503a\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u4ee3\u51c6\u5907\u91d1\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e14\u4ec5\u4ece\u5df2\u7ed3\u7b97\u7d22\u8d54\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u672a\u51b3\u7d22\u8d54\u8d1f\u503a\u4f1a\u968f\u7d22\u8d54\u8fdb\u5c55\u53cd\u590d\u4fee\u8ba2\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e2a\u4f53\u7d22\u8d54\u51c6\u5907\u91d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u7d22\u8d54\u7ea7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u6eda\u52a8\u7ed3\u7b97\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728CAS\u548cSPLICE\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u822c\u4fdd\u9669\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Soft Actor - Critic\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7d22\u8d54\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u603b\u672a\u51b3\u7d22\u8d54\u8d1f\u503a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ece\u6240\u6709\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7d22\u8d54\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u51b3\u7d22\u8d54\u51c6\u5907\u91d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8d1f\u503a\u7684\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\u7d22\u8d54\u6bb5\u3002"}}

The central challenge is to balance consistency and robustness: when predictions are accurate, the algorithm should select a near-optimal secretary, while under inaccurate predictions it should still guarantee a bounded competitive ratio.\n  We consider both the classical Random Order Secretary Problem (ROSP), where candidates arrive in a uniformly random order, and a more natural learning-augmented model in which the decision-maker may choose the arrival order based on predicted values. We call this model the Chosen Order Secretary Problem (COSP), capturing scenarios such as interview schedules set in advance.\n  We propose a new randomized algorithm applicable to both ROSP and COSP. Our method switches from fully trusting predictions to a threshold-based rule once a large prediction deviation is detected. Let $\u03b5\\in [0,1]$ denote the maximum multiplicative prediction error.

This leads to globally suboptimal behavior, where plans are frequently revised or abandoned entirely. In the influential model of Kleinberg and Oren (2014) such behavior is modeled by a present-biased agent navigating a task graph toward a goal, making locally optimal decisions at each step based on discounted future costs. As a result, the agent may repeatedly deviate from initial plans. Recent work by Belova et al. (2024) introduced a two-agent extension of this model, where a fully-aware principal attempts to guide the present-biased agent through a specific set of critical tasks without causing abandonment. This captures a rich class of principal-agent dynamics in behavioral settings.\n  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive algorithmic characterization of this problem. We analyze its computational complexity through the framework of parameterized algorithms, focusing on graph parameters that naturally emerge in this setting, such as treewidth, vertex cover, and feedback vertex set. Our main result is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm when parameterized by the treewidth of the task graph and the number of distinct (v,t)-path costs. Our algorithm encaptures several input settings, such as bounded edge costs and restricted task graph structure. We demonstrate that our main result yields efficient algorithms for a number of such configurations.\n  We complement this with tight hardness results, that highlight the extreme difficulty of the problem even on simplest graphs with bounded number of nodes and constant parameter values, and motivate our choice of parameters.

However, conventional RAG systems operate under a \"retrieve-always\" assumption, querying vector databases for every input regardless of query complexity. This static approach incurs substantial computational overhead and inference latency, particularly problematic for high-throughput production deployments. We introduce L-RAG (Lazy Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an adaptive framework that implements hierarchical context management through entropy-based gating. L-RAG employs a two-tier architecture: queries are first processed with a compact document summary, and expensive chunk retrieval is triggered only when the model's predictive entropy exceeds a calibrated threshold, signaling genuine uncertainty. Through experiments on SQuAD 2.0 (N=500) using the Phi-2 model, we demonstrate that L-RAG provides a tunable accuracy-efficiency trade-off: at a conservative threshold (tau=0.5), L-RAG achieves 78.2% accuracy, matching Standard RAG (77.8%), with 8% retrieval reduction; at a balanced threshold (tau=1.0), retrieval reduction increases to 26% with modest accuracy trade-off (76.0%). Latency analysis shows that L-RAG saves 80-210ms per query when retrieval latency exceeds 500ms. Analysis of entropy distributions reveals statistically significant separation (p < 0.001) between correct predictions (H=1.72) and errors (H=2.20), validating entropy as a reliable uncertainty signal.

This paper introduces Vextra, a novel middleware abstraction layer designed to address this fragmentation. Vextra presents a unified, high-level API for core database operations, including data upsertion, similarity search, and metadata filtering. It employs a pluggable adapter architecture to translate these unified API calls into the native protocols of various backend databases.

Widely used performance models primarily focus on cache and memory bandwidth, which is suitable for many memory-bound workloads. However, it is unsuitable for highly arithmetic intensive cases such as the sum-factorization with tensor $n$-mode product kernels, which are an optimization technique for high-order finite element methods (FEM). On processors with relatively high single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instruction latency, such as the Fujitsu A64FX, the performance of these kernels is strongly influenced by loop-body splitting strategies. Memory-bandwidth-oriented models are therefore not appropriate for evaluating these splitting configurations, and a model that directly reflects instruction-level efficiency is required. To address this need, we develop a dependency-chain-based analytical formulation that links loop-splitting configurations to instruction dependencies in the tensor $n$-mode product kernel. We further use XGBoost to estimate key parameters in the analytical model that are difficult to model explicitly. Evaluations show that the learning-augmented model outperforms the widely used standard Roofline and Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) models. On the Fujitsu A64FX processor, the learning-augmented model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) between 1% and 24% for polynomial orders ($P$) from 1 to 15. In comparison, the standard Roofline and ECM models yield errors of 42%-256% and 5%-117%, respectively. On the Intel Xeon Gold 6230 processor, the learning-augmented model achieves MAPE values from 1% to 13% for $P$=1 to $P$=14, and 24% at $P$=15. In contrast, the standard Roofline and ECM models produce errors of 1%-73% and 8%-112% for $P$=1 to $P$=15, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7b97\u672f\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5f20\u91cf n \u6a21\u79ef\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4f9d\u8d56\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7b97\u672f\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5f20\u91cf n \u6a21\u79ef\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u6307\u4ee4\u7ea7\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u94fe\u7684\u5206\u6790\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528 XGBoost \u4f30\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u96be\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6 Roofline \u548c ECM \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u5f88\u4f4e\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7b97\u672f\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5f20\u91cf n \u6a21\u79ef\u5185\u6838\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

These gains, however, are increasingly accompanied by concerns regarding long-horizon developmental behavior, as many systems converge toward repetitive solution patterns rather than sustained growth.\n  We argue that a central limitation of contemporary AI systems lies not in capability per se, but in the premature fixation of their performance frontier. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of a \\emph{Dynamic Intelligence Ceiling} (DIC), defined as the highest level of effective intelligence attainable by a system at a given time under its current resources, internal intent, and structural configuration.\n  To make this notion empirically tractable, we propose a trajectory-centric evaluation framework that measures intelligence as a moving frontier rather than a static snapshot. We operationalize DIC using two estimators: the \\emph{Progressive Difficulty Ceiling} (PDC), which captures the maximal reliably solvable difficulty under constrained resources, and the \\emph{Ceiling Drift Rate} (CDR), which quantifies the temporal evolution of this frontier. These estimators are instantiated through a procedurally generated benchmark that jointly evaluates long-horizon planning and structural creativity within a single controlled environment.\n  Our results reveal a qualitative distinction between systems that deepen exploitation within a fixed solution manifold and those that sustain frontier expansion over time. Importantly, our framework does not posit unbounded intelligence, but reframes limits as dynamic and trajectory-dependent rather than static and prematurely fixed.\n  \\vspace{0.5em} \\noindent\\textbf{Keywords:} AI evaluation, planning and creativity, developmental intelligence, dynamic intelligence ceilings, complex adaptive systems", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u5929\u82b1\u677f\uff08DIC\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u89c6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u957f\u671f\u53d1\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u591a\u8d8b\u4e8e\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u5728\u4e8e\u8fc7\u65e9\u56fa\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DIC\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u96be\u5ea6\u5929\u82b1\u677f\uff08PDC\uff09\u548c\u5929\u82b1\u677f\u6f02\u79fb\u7387\uff08CDR\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6d41\u5f62\u5185\u6df1\u5316\u5229\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6301\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u65e0\u754c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5c06\u9650\u5236\u91cd\u5851\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u548c\u8fc7\u65e9\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u3002"}}

Spot instances offer 3-10x lower cost than on-demand instances, but their unpredictable availability makes meeting deadlines difficult. Existing systems either rely solely on spot instances and risk deadline violations, or operate in simplified single-region settings. These approaches overlook substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity in spot availability, lifetimes, and prices. We show that exploiting such heterogeneity to access more spot capacity is the key to reduce the job execution cost. We present SkyNomad, a multi-region scheduling system that maximizes spot usage and minimizes cost while guaranteeing deadlines. SkyNomad uses lightweight probing to estimate availability, predicts spot lifetimes, accounts for migration cost, and unifies regional characteristics and deadline pressure into a monetary cost model that guides scheduling decisions. Our evaluation shows that SkyNomad achieves 1.25-3.96x cost savings in real cloud deployments and performs within 10% cost differences of an optimal policy in simulation, while consistently meeting deadlines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u533a\u57df\u8c03\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edfSkyNomad\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u8d27\u5b9e\u4f8b\u65f6\u7a7a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4eAI\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4f5c\u4e1a\u9700\u5927\u91cfGPU\u8d44\u6e90\u4e14\u6709\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u8d27\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4f46\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u964d\u4f4e\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSkyNomad\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u73b0\u8d27\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u8fc1\u79fb\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5c06\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u7edf\u4e00\u5230\u8d27\u5e01\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e91\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b01.25 - 3.96\u500d\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u572810%\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u59cb\u7ec8\u6ee1\u8db3\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u8d27\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\uff0cSkyNomad\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

Existing deterministic approaches that combine heuristic signals, semantic similarity measures, and graph-based centrality metrics have demonstrated effectiveness in nar-rowing candidate search spaces, yet their recall plateaus. This limitation stems from the treatment of features as linearly independent contributors, ignoring contextual dependencies and relationships between metrics that characterize expert reasoning patterns. To address this limitation, we propose the application of Multi-Head Self-Attention as a post-deterministic scoring refinement mechanism. Our approach learns contextual weighting between features, dynamically adjust-ing importance levels per file based on relational behavior exhibited across candidate file sets. The attention mechanism produces context-aware adjustments that are additively combined with deterministic scores, pre-serving interpretability while enabling reasoning similar to that performed by experts when reviewing change surfaces. We focus on recall rather than precision, as false negatives (missing impacted files) are far more costly than false positives (irrelevant files that can be quickly dismissed during review). Empirical evaluation on 200 test cases demonstrates that the introduc-tion of self-attention improves Top-50 recall from approximately 62-65% to between 78-82% depending on repository complexity and structure, achiev-ing 80% recall at Top-50 files. Expert validation yields improvement from 6.5/10 to 8.6/10 in subjective accuracy alignment.

In modern financial markets, however, shocks often propagate through complex networks of interconnections, giving rise to systemic and spillover risks that variance alone does not reflect.\n  This paper develops a unified portfolio optimization framework that incorporates connectedness risk alongside expected return and variance. Using a quadratic measure of network spillovers derived from a connectedness matrix, we formulate a three-objective optimization problem and characterize the resulting three-dimensional efficient surface. We establish existence, uniqueness, and continuity of optimal portfolios under mild regularity conditions and derive closed-form solutions when short-selling is allowed. The trade-off between variance and connectedness is shown to be strictly monotone except in degenerate cases, yielding a well-defined risk-risk frontier.\n  Under simultaneous diagonalizability of the covariance and connectedness matrices, we prove a three-fund separation theorem: all efficient portfolios can be expressed as affine combinations of a minimum-variance portfolio, a minimum-connectedness portfolio, and the tangency portfolio.

However, existing methods often struggle with high-dimensional covariates, limiting accuracy, interpretability, and real-world applicability. We propose a novel sufficient dimension reduction approach that directly targets the contrast between potential outcomes and identifies a low-dimensional subspace of the covariates capturing treatment effect heterogeneity. This reduced representation enables more accurate estimation of optimal ITRs through outcome-weighted learning.

In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as promising and efficient methods for modeling surface pressure field, being alternatives to computationally expensive CFD simulations. Currently, large-scale public datasets are available for domains such as automotive aerodynamics. However, in many specialized areas, such as high-speed trains, data scarcity remains a fundamental challenge in aerodynamic modeling, severely limiting the effectiveness of standard neural network approaches. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Field Learning Framework (AdaField), which pre-trains the model on public large-scale datasets to improve generalization in sub-domains with limited data. AdaField comprises two key components. First, we design the Semantic Aggregation Point Transformer (SAPT) as a high-performance backbone that efficiently handles large-scale point clouds for surface pressure prediction. Second, regarding the substantial differences in flow conditions and geometric scales across different aerodynamic subdomains, we propose Flow-Conditioned Adapter (FCA) and Physics-Informed Data Augmentation (PIDA). FCA enables the model to flexibly adapt to different flow conditions with a small set of trainable parameters, while PIDA expands the training data distribution to better cover variations in object scale and velocity. Our experiments show that AdaField achieves SOTA performance on the DrivAerNet++ dataset and can be effectively transferred to train and aircraft scenarios with minimal fine-tuning.

We ask whether a minimal, backpropagation-free feedback--Hebbian system can already express interpretable continual-learning--relevant behaviors under controlled training schedules. We introduce a compact prediction--reconstruction architecture with two feedforward layers for supervised association learning and two dedicated feedback layers trained to reconstruct earlier activity and re-inject it as additive temporal context. All synapses are updated by a unified local rule combining centered Hebbian covariance, Oja-style stabilization, and a local supervised drive where targets are available, requiring no weight transport or global error backpropagation. On a small two-pair association task, we characterize learning through layer-wise activity snapshots, connectivity trajectories (row/column means of learned weights), and a normalized retention index across phases. Under sequential A->B training, forward output connectivity exhibits a long-term depression (LTD)-like suppression of the earlier association while feedback connectivity preserves an A-related trace during acquisition of B. Under deterministic interleaving A,B,A,B,..., both associations are concurrently maintained rather than sequentially suppressed. Architectural controls and rule-term ablations isolate the role of dedicated feedback in regeneration and co-maintenance, and the role of the local supervised term in output selectivity and unlearning.

Building on this progress, these ideas have been generalized to empirical cross-covariance matrices, whose singular-value shrinkage characterizes comovements between one set of assets and another. Existing analytical cross-covariance cleaners are derived under strong stationarity and large-sample assumptions, and they typically rely on mesoscopic regularity conditions such as bounded spectra; macroscopic common modes (e.g., a global market factor) violate these conditions. When applied to real equity returns, where dependence structures drift over time and global modes are prominent, we find that these theoretically optimal formulas do not translate into robust out-of-sample performance. We address this gap by designing a random-matrix-inspired neural architecture that operates in the empirical singular-vector basis and learns a nonlinear mapping from empirical singular values to their corresponding cleaned values. By construction, the network can recover the analytical solution as a special case, yet it remains flexible enough to adapt to non-stationary dynamics and mode-driven distortions. Trained on a long history of equity returns, the proposed method achieves a more favorable bias-variance trade-off than purely analytical cleaners and delivers systematically lower out-of-sample cross-covariance prediction errors.

In classic random-turn games, control of each node is assigned randomly every time the node is visited during a play. In this work, we study two natural variants of this where control of each node is assigned only once: (i) control is assigned randomly during a play when a node is visited for the first time and does not change for the rest of the play and (ii) control is assigned a priori before the game starts for every node by independent coin tosses and then the game is played. We investigate the complexity of computing the winning probability with three kinds of objectives-reachability, parity, and energy. We show that the qualitative questions on all variants and all objectives are NL-complete. For the quantitative questions, we show that deciding whether the maximiser can win with probability at least a given threshold for every objective is PSPACE-complete under the first mechanism, and that computing the exact winning probability for every objective is sharp-P-complete under the second. To complement our hardness results for the second mechanism, we propose randomised approximation schemes that efficiently estimate the winning probability for all three objectives, assuming a bounded number of parity colours and unary-encoded weights for energy objectives, and we empirically demonstrate their fast convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56fa\u5b9a\u6709\u9650\u56fe\u4e0a\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u8282\u70b9\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u7684\u4e24\u4eba\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u957f\u6e38\u620f\u6c42\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u4e09\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u80dc\u8d1f\u6982\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u968f\u673a\u56de\u5408\u6e38\u620f\u6bcf\u6b21\u8bbf\u95ee\u8282\u70b9\u65f6\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u63a7\u5236\u6743\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u4ec5\u5206\u914d\u4e00\u6b21\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0b\u6e38\u620f\u6c42\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u5947\u5076\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\uff09\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u83b7\u80dc\u6982\u7387\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u6240\u6709\u53d8\u4f53\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u662fNL - \u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff1b\u5b9a\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u5224\u5b9a\u6700\u5927\u8005\u83b7\u80dc\u6982\u7387\u662f\u5426\u81f3\u5c11\u4e3a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u662fPSPACE - \u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u83b7\u80dc\u6982\u7387\u662fsharp - P - \u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5236\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u6e38\u620f\u6c42\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u7684\u786c\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002"}}

In practice, however, heterogeneous vocabularies and divergent modeling conventions hinder automated, content-level comparison across AAS. This paper proposes a hybrid graph matching approach to enable semantics-aware comparison of Digital Twin representations.

We show that when the query is part of the input - the combined complexity setting - determining whether or not a repair exists is polynomial-time is equivalent to the satisfiability problem for classes of queries admitting a weak form of projection and selection. We then identify the sub-classes of unions of conjunctive queries with negated atoms, defined by the relational algebra operations permitted to appear in the query, for which the minimal repair problem can be solved in polynomial time. In contrast, we show that the problem is NP-hard, as well as set cover-hard to approximate via strict reductions, whenever both projection and join are permitted in the input query. Additionally, we show that finding the size of a minimal repair for unions of conjunctive queries (with negated atoms permitted) is OptP[log(n)]-complete, while computing a minimal repair is possible with O($n^2$) queries to an NP oracle. With recursion permitted, the combined complexity of all of these variants increases significantly, with an EXP lower bound.

We consider task processing performance across low Earth orbit (LEO) to Low-Medium Earth Orbit (Low-MEO) constellation sizes, under varying traffic loads. Using Single-Level Tree Network(SLTN)-based cooperative task allocation architecture, we attempt to evaluate some key performance metrics - blocking probabilities, response times, energy consumption, and resource utilization across several tens of thousands of tasks per experiment. Our resource-conscious RATA monitors key parameters such as arrival rate, resources (on-board compute, storage, bandwidth, battery) availability, satellite eclipses' influence in processing and communications. This study is an important step towards analyzing the performance under lighter to stress inducing levels of compute intense workloads to test the ultimate performance limits under the combined influence of the above-mentioned factors. Results show pronounced non-linear scaling: while capacity increases with constellation size, blocking and delay grow rapidly, whereas energy remains resilient under solar-aware scheduling. The analysis identifies a practical satellite-count limit for baseline SLTNs and demonstrates that CPU availability, rather than energy, is the primary cause of blocking.

Conventional prioritization frame- works such as CVSS offer static severity met- rics that fail to account for exploit probabil- ity, compliance urgency, and operational im- pact, resulting in inefficient and delayed re- mediation. This paper introduces RiskBridge, an explainable and compliance-aware vulner- ability management framework that integrates multi-source intelligence from CVSS v4, EPSS, and CISA KEV to produce dynamic, business- aligned patch priorities. RiskBridge employs a probabilistic Zero-Day Exposure Simulation (ZDES) model to fore- cast near-term exploit likelihood, a Policy-as- Code Engine to translate regulatory mandates (e.g., PCI DSS, NIST SP 800-53) into auto- mated SLA logic, and an ROI-driven Opti- mizer to maximize cumulative risk reduction per remediation effort. Experimental evalua- tions using live CVE datasets demonstrate an 88% reduction in residual risk, an 18-day improvement in SLA compliance, and a 35% increase in remediation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art commercial baselines. These findings validate RiskBridge as a prac- tical and auditable decision-intelligence sys- tem that unifies probabilistic modeling, com- pliance reasoning, and optimization analytics.

In such settings, it is important to account for the inherent dependence that arises when individuals are nested within higher-level units, such as hospitals. Existing survival models account for group-level heterogeneity through frailty terms but do not uncover latent patient subgroups, while most clustering methods ignore hierarchical structure and are not estimated jointly with survival outcomes. In this work, we introduce a new framework that simultaneously performs patient clustering and shared-frailty survival modeling through a penalized likelihood approach. The proposed methodology adaptively learns a patient-to-patient similarity matrix via a modified version of spectral clustering, enabling cluster formation directly from estimated risk profiles while accounting for group membership. A simulation study highlights the proposed model's ability to recover latent clusters and to correctly estimate hazard parameters. We apply our method to a large cohort of heart-failure patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between 2020 and 2021 in the Lombardy region (Italy), identifying clinically meaningful subgroups characterized by distinct risk profiles and highlighting the role of respiratory comorbidities and hospital-level variability in shaping mortality outcomes.

Unfortunately, it suffers from the extensive computational costs of iterative evaluations, which involves the expensive simulation with the candidate parameter. While Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms (SAEAs) have been widely adopted to alleviate the computational burden, existing methods face two key limitations: 1) surrogating the original evaluation function is hard due the nonlinear yet multi-modal nature of the ABMs, and 2) the commonly used surrogates cannot share the optimization experience among multiple calibration tasks, making the batched calibration less effective. To address these issues, this work proposes Automatic posterior transformation with Negatively Correlated Search and Adaptive Trust-Region (ANTR). ANTR first replaces the traditional surrogates with a pretrainable neural density estimator that directly models the posterior distribution of the parameters given observed data, thereby aligning the optimization objective with parameter-space accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate a diversity-preserving search strategy to prevent premature convergence and an adaptive trust-region method to efficiently allocate computational resources. We take two representative ABM-based financial market simulators as the test bench as due to the high non-linearity.

It maintains two learnable latent tokens - an answer token and a reasoning state - that are iteratively refined by a compact, parameter-efficient recursive network. The recursive processing layer repeatedly updates the reasoning state given the full token sequence and then refines the answer token, in close analogy with iterative insurance pricing schemes.

A central question in this area is how predictions can improve performance, and a key aspect of this analysis is the role of prediction accuracy. In this context, prediction accuracy is defined as a guaranteed probability that an instance drawn from the distribution belongs to the predicted set. As a performance measure that incorporates prediction accuracy, we focus on the distributionally-robust competitive ratio (DRCR), introduced by Sun et al.~(ICML 2024). The DRCR is defined as the expected ratio between the algorithm's cost and the optimal cost, where the expectation is taken over the worst-case instance distribution that satisfies the given prediction and accuracy requirement. A known structural property is that, for any fixed algorithm, the DRCR decreases linearly as prediction accuracy increases. Building on this result, we establish that the optimal DRCR value (i.e., the infimum over all algorithms) is a monotone and concave function of prediction accuracy. We further generalize the DRCR framework to a multiple-prediction setting and show that monotonicity and concavity are preserved in this setting. Finally, we apply our results to the ski rental problem, a benchmark problem in online optimization, to identify the conditions on prediction accuracies required for the optimal DRCR to attain a target value. Moreover, we provide a method for computing the critical accuracy, defined as the minimum accuracy required for the optimal DRCR to strictly improve upon the performance attainable without any accuracy guarantee.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7b97\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\uff08DRCR\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6700\u4f18DRCR\u662f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u51f9\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u591a\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6ed1\u96ea\u79df\u8d41\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e34\u754c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u5173\u6ce8\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807DRCR\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2dDRCR\u968f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u8bc1\u660e\u6700\u4f18DRCR\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5c06\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u591a\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u6ed1\u96ea\u79df\u8d41\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u6700\u4f18DRCR\u662f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u51f9\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u591a\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u51f9\u6027\u4ecd\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6ed1\u96ea\u79df\u8d41\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6700\u4f18DRCR\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e34\u754c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18DRCR\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u6ed1\u96ea\u79df\u8d41\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are widely used for interpretation. However, existing time-series variants typically treat the feature and time axes independently, fragmenting structural signals formed jointly by multiple variables over specific intervals. We propose GroupSegment SHAP (GS-SHAP), which constructs explanatory units as group-segment players based on cross-variable dependence and distribution shifts over time, and then quantifies each unit's contribution via Shapley attribution. We evaluate GS-SHAP across four real-world domains: human activity recognition, power-system forecasting, medical signal analysis, and financial time series, and compare it with KernelSHAP, TimeSHAP, SequenceSHAP, WindowSHAP, and TSHAP. GS-SHAP improves deletion-based faithfulness (DeltaAUC) by about 1.7x on average over time-series SHAP baselines, while reducing wall-clock runtime by about 40 percent on average under matched perturbation budgets.

Existing imputation methods emphasize trajectory recovery, paying limited attention to interpretability and failing to provide underlying knowledge that benefits downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and route planning. We propose knowledge-driven interpretable vessel trajectory imputation (VISTA), the first trajectory imputation framework that offers interpretability while simultaneously providing underlying knowledge to support downstream analysis. Specifically, we first define underlying knowledge as a combination of Structured Data-derived Knowledge (SDK) distilled from AIS data and Implicit LLM Knowledge acquired from large-scale Internet corpora. Second, to manage and leverage the SDK effectively at scale, we develop a data-knowledge-data loop that employs a Structured Data-derived Knowledge Graph for SDK extraction and knowledge-driven trajectory imputation. Third, to efficiently process large-scale AIS data, we introduce a workflow management layer that coordinates the end-to-end pipeline, enabling parallel knowledge extraction and trajectory imputation with anomaly handling and redundancy elimination.

While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) established the dominant paradigm, a proliferation of alternatives -- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), and many others -- has left practitioners without clear guidance on method selection. This survey provides a \\textit{theoretical unification} of preference learning methods, revealing that the apparent diversity reduces to principled choices along three orthogonal axes: \\textbf{(I) Preference Model} (what likelihood model underlies the objective), \\textbf{(II) Regularization Mechanism} (how deviation from reference policies is controlled), and \\textbf{(III) Data Distribution} (online vs.\\ offline learning and coverage requirements). We formalize each axis with precise definitions and theorems, establishing key results including the coverage separation between online and offline methods, scaling laws for reward overoptimization, and conditions under which direct alignment methods fail. Our analysis reveals that failure modes -- length hacking, mode collapse, likelihood displacement -- arise from specific, predictable combinations of design choices.

However, little is known about how SATD manifests and evolves in contemporary Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, whose architectures, workflows, and dependencies differ fundamentally from both traditional and pre-LLM ML software. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of SATD in the LLM era, replicating and extending prior work on ML technical debt to modern LLM-based systems. We compare SATD prevalence across LLM, ML, and non-ML repositories across a total of 477 repositories (159 per category). We perform survival analysis of SATD introduction and removal to understand the dynamics of technical debt across different development paradigms. Surprisingly, despite their architectural complexity, our results reveal that LLM repositories accumulate SATD at similar rates to ML systems (3.95% vs. 4.10%). However, we observe that LLM repositories remain debt-free 2.4x longer than ML repositories (a median of 492 days vs. 204 days), and then start to accumulate technical debt rapidly. Moreover, our qualitative analysis of 377 SATD instances reveals three new forms of technical debt unique to LLM-based development that have not been reported in prior research: Model-Stack Workaround Debt, Model Dependency Debt, and Performance Optimization Debt. Finally, by mapping SATD to stages of the LLM development pipeline, we observe that debt concentrates", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u81ea\u627f\u8ba4\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\uff08SATD\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4LLM\u3001ML\u548c\u975eML\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684SATD\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u4ed3\u5e93\u79ef\u7d2fSATD\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0eML\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u503a\u52a1\u65f6\u957f\u66f4\u957f\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u5f00\u53d1\u7279\u6709\u7684\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u4e8eSATD\u5728\u5f53\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u6f14\u53d8\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u590d\u5236\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8eML\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5230\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4477\u4e2a\u4ed3\u5e93\uff08\u6bcf\u7c7b159\u4e2a\uff09\u4e2dSATD\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9SATD\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9377\u4e2aSATD\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06SATD\u6620\u5c04\u5230LLM\u5f00\u53d1\u6d41\u7a0b\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "LLM\u4ed3\u5e93\u79ef\u7d2fSATD\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0eML\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u4f3c\uff083.95% vs. 4.10%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u4ed3\u5e93\u65e0\u503a\u52a1\u65f6\u957f\u662fML\u4ed3\u5e93\u76842.4\u500d\uff08\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570492\u5929 vs. 204\u5929\uff09\uff0c\u4e4b\u540e\u5feb\u901f\u79ef\u7d2f\u503a\u52a1\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u5f00\u53d1\u7279\u6709\u7684\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u6808\u53d8\u901a\u65b9\u6848\u503a\u52a1\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u503a\u52a1\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u503a\u52a1\uff1b\u503a\u52a1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728LLM\u5f00\u53d1\u6d41\u7a0b\u7279\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9LLM\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684SATD\u6709\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u5f62\u5f0f\u53ca\u79ef\u7d2f\u7279\u70b9\u3002"}}

Rather than modeling rapid adaptation as implicit optimization or meta-learning, we formulate task- and context-specific learning as the sequential inference of a low-dimensional latent adaptation state governed by a linearized state-space model. Under Gaussian assumptions, adaptation follows a Kalman recursion with closed-form updates for both the posterior mean and covariance.\n  This perspective elevates epistemic uncertainty to an explicit dynamical variable. We show that inference-time learning is driven by covariance collapse, i.e., rapid contraction of posterior uncertainty induced by informative tokens, which typically precedes convergence of the posterior mean. Using observability conditions on token-level Jacobians, we establish stability of the Bayesian filter, prove exponential covariance contraction rates, and derive mean-square error bounds. Gradient descent, natural-gradient methods, and meta-learning updates arise as singular, noise-free limits of the filtering dynamics, positioning optimization-based adaptation as a degenerate approximation of Bayesian inference.\n  The resulting theory provides a unified probabilistic account of in-context learning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and test-time learning without parameter updates. It yields explicit guarantees on stability and sample efficiency, offers a principled interpretation of prompt informativeness via information accumulation, and clarifies the role of uncertainty dynamics absent from existing accounts.

While learning dynamics and generalization on isotropic data are well-established, the impact of pronounced anisotropy on these crucial aspects is not yet fully understood. We examine the impact of data anisotropy, represented by a spiked covariance structure, a canonical yet tractable model, on the learning dynamics and generalization error of a two-layer linear network in a linear regression setting. Our analysis reveals that the learning dynamics proceed in two distinct phases, governed initially by the input-output correlation and subsequently by other principal directions of the data structure. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the generalization error, quantifying how the alignment of the spike structure of the data with the learning task improves performance.

A common challenge arises when attempting to compare a treatment with available individual patient data (IPD) against a competitor with only reported aggregate-level data (ALD), particularly when trial populations differ in effect modifiers. While methods such as Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) and Simulated Treatment Comparison (STC) exist to adjust for these cross-trial differences, software implementations have often been fragmented or limited in scope. This article introduces outstandR, an R package designed to provide a comprehensive and unified framework for population-adjusted indirect comparison (PAIC). Beyond standard weighting and regression approaches, outstandR implements advanced G-computation methods within both maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks, and Multiple Imputation Marginalization (MIM) to address non-collapsibility and missing data.

Recent advances in data availability and computational power enable new forms of model-driven, simulation-based decision support for transportation policy design. This paper proposes a novel simulation paradigm for the ex-ante evaluation of both direct impacts (e.g., traffic conditions, modal shift, emissions) and indirect impacts spanning transportation-related effects, social equity, and economic accessibility. The approach integrates a multi-layer urban mobility model combining a physical layer of networks, flows, and emissions with a social layer capturing behavioral responses and adaptation to policy changes. Real-world data are used to instantiate the current \"as-is\" scenario, while policy alternatives and behavioral assumptions are encoded as model parameters to generate multiple \"what-if\" scenarios. The framework supports systematic comparison across scenarios by analyzing variations in simulated outcomes induced by policy interventions. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study aims to assess the impacts of the introduction of broad urban traffic restriction schemes.

We develop a spatial model of two-party competition in which voters evaluate parties through general satisfaction functions, and a width parameter $q$ captures how tolerant they are of ideological distance. This parameter governs the balance between centripetal and centrifugal incentives and acts as the bifurcation parameter governing equilibrium configurations. Under mild regularity assumptions, we characterize Nash equilibria through center-distance coordinates, which separate the endogenous political center from polarization. When the voter density is symmetric, the reduced equilibrium condition exhibits a generic supercritical pitchfork bifurcation at a critical value $q_{c}$. Above $q_{c}$, the unique stable equilibrium features convergence to the center, recovering the classical median voter result, whereas below it two symmetric polarized equilibria arise. Asymmetry in the voter distribution unfolds the pitchfork, producing drift in the endogenous center and asymmetric polarized equilibria. The resulting equilibrium diagram has an S-shaped geometry that generates hysteresis, allowing polarization to persist even after tolerance returns to levels that would support convergence in a symmetric environment. In the high-tolerance regime, we show that the unique non-polarized equilibrium converges to the mean of the voter distribution, while the median is recovered only under symmetry. Hence, unlike the Hotelling--Downs model, where convergence to the median is universal, the median voter appears here as an asymptotic benchmark rather than a robust predictor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u515a\u7ade\u4e89\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9009\u6c11\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6781\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e2d\u4f4d\u9009\u6c11\u53ea\u662f\u6e10\u8fd1\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u515a\u7ade\u4e89\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e2d\u4f4d\u9009\u6c11\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u653f\u515a\u4f53\u7cfb\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u4e45\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u6781\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6545\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u515a\u7ade\u4e89\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570$q$\u8868\u793a\u9009\u6c11\u5bf9\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e29\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5047\u8bbe\u7528\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8ddd\u79bb\u5750\u6807\u523b\u753b\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u9009\u6c11\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\uff0c$q$\u5927\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u503c\u4ea7\u751f\u552f\u4e00\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5747\u8861\uff1b\u5c0f\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u503c\u4ea7\u751f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6781\u5316\u5747\u8861\u3002\u9009\u6c11\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6781\u5316\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5747\u8861\u56fe\u5448S\u5f62\u6709\u6ede\u540e\u6027\u3002\u9ad8\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u4e0b\u975e\u6781\u5316\u5747\u8861\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9009\u6c11\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u624d\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e2d\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8eHotelling - Downs\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u9009\u6c11\u662f\u6e10\u8fd1\u57fa\u51c6\u800c\u975e\u7a33\u5065\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

GPUs offer a promising path to high-performance ANNS: they provide massive parallelism for distance computations, are readily available, and can co-locate with downstream applications.\n  Despite these advantages, current GPU-accelerated ANNS systems face three key limitations. First, real-world applications operate on evolving datasets that require fast batch updates, yet most GPU indices must be rebuilt from scratch when new data arrives. Second, high-dimensional vectors strain memory bandwidth, but current GPU systems lack efficient quantization techniques that reduce data movement without introducing costly random memory accesses. Third, the data-dependent memory accesses inherent to greedy search make overlapping compute and memory difficult, leading to reduced performance.\n  We present Jasper, a GPU-native ANNS system with both high query throughput and updatability. Jasper builds on the Vamana graph index and overcomes existing bottlenecks via three contributions: (1) a CUDA batch-parallel construction algorithm that enables lock-free streaming insertions, (2) a GPU-efficient implementation of RaBitQ quantization that reduces memory footprint up to 8x without the random access penalties, and (3) an optimized greedy search kernel that increases compute utilization, resulting in better latency hiding and higher throughput.\n  Our evaluation across five datasets shows that Jasper achieves up to 1.93x higher query throughput than CAGRA and achieves up to 80% peak utilization as measured by the roofline model. Jasper's construction scales efficiently and constructs indices an average of 2.4x faster than CAGRA while providing updatability that CAGRA lacks.

We present CBMAS, a diagnostic framework for continuous activation steering, which extends cognitive bias analysis from discrete before/after interventions to interpretable trajectories. By combining steering vector construction with dense \u03b1-sweeps, logit lens-based bias curves, and layer-site sensitivity analysis, our approach can reveal tipping points where small intervention strengths flip model behavior and show how steering effects evolve across layer depth. We argue that these continuous diagnostics offer a bridge between high-level behavioral evaluation and low-level representational dynamics, contributing to the cognitive interpretability of LLMs. Lastly, we provide a CLI and datasets for various cognitive behaviors at the project repository, https://github.com/shimamooo/CBMAS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCBMAS\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u96be\u8bca\u65ad\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u5c42\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6c\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u03b1\u626b\u63cf\u3001\u57fa\u4e8elogit lens\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u5c42\u4f4d\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u5e72\u9884\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u8f6c\u5411\u6548\u679c\u968f\u5c42\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fde\u7eed\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u8868\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\u642d\u5efa\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents two new frameworks, named DiveRgence-based Adaptive aGgregation (DRAG) and Byzantine-Resilient DRAG (BR-DRAG), to mitigate client drifts and resist attacks while expediting training. DRAG designs a reference direction and a metric named divergence of degree to quantify the deviation of local updates. Accordingly, each worker can align its local update via linear calibration without extra communication cost. BR-DRAG refines DRAG under Byzantine attacks by maintaining a vetted root dataset at the server to produce trusted reference directions. The workers' updates can be then calibrated to mitigate divergence caused by malicious attacks.

Starting from clean checkpoints of Qwen2.5 (0.5B/1.5B) and Gemma3 (1B/4B), we inject five copies of GSM8K and MBPP test items into the first 2B tokens of an otherwise 25B token extended pre-training dataset. We then compare the contaminated and clean models both immediately after pre-training and again after two popular post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). The applied post-training steps do not have any contamination. Across math and coding benchmarks, we find three consistent patterns: (i) Contamination causes performance spikes that are gradually diminished with continued pre-training. After even 25B tokens the apparent performance inflation of contamination can become close to zero. (ii) Both SFT and GRPO resurface the leaked information, but with different external validity: SFT inflates scores only on the contaminated tasks, whereas GRPO also inflates performance on uncontaminated counterparts (GSMPlus, HumanEval). (iii) Model scale amplifies these tendencies, larger Supervised Fine Tuned models memorize more, while larger GRPO models translate leakage into more generalizable capabilities.

In practice, the matching rewards are high-dimensional due to the growing diversity of participants. We leverage a natural low-rank matrix structure of the matching rewards in these two-sided markets, and propose to utilize matrix completion to accelerate reward learning with limited offline data. A unique property for matrix completion in this setting is that the entries of the reward matrix are observed with matching interference -- i.e., the entries are not observed independently but dependently due to matching or budget constraints. Such matching dependence renders unique technical challenges, such as sub-optimality or inapplicability of the existing analytical tools in the matrix completion literature, since they typically rely on sample independence. In this paper, we first show that standard nuclear norm regularization remains theoretically effective under matching interference. We provide a near-optimal Frobenius norm guarantee in this setting, coupled with a new analytical technique. Next, to guide certain matching decisions, we develop a novel ``double-enhanced'' estimator, based off the nuclear norm estimator, with a near-optimal entry-wise guarantee. Our double-enhancement procedure can apply to broader sampling schemes even with dependence, which may be of independent interest. Additionally, we extend our approach to online learning settings with matching constraints such as optimal matching and stable matching, and present improved regret bounds in matrix dimensions.

Identifying a common invariant subspace across network layers has become an active area of research, as such a subspace can filter out layer-specific noise, facilitate cross-network comparisons, reduce dimensionality, and extract shared structural features of scientific interest. One statistical approach to detecting a common subspace is hypothesis testing, which evaluates whether the observed networks share a common latent structure. In this paper, we propose an empirical likelihood (EL) based test for this purpose.

However, traditional ACO methods often exhibit shortcomings, such as blind search behavior and slow convergence within complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Pheromone-Focused Ant Colony Optimization (PFACO) algorithm, which introduces three key strategies to enhance the problem-solving ability of the ant colony. First, the initial pheromone distribution is concentrated in more promising regions based on the Euclidean distances of nodes to the start and end points, balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Second, promising solutions are reinforced during colony iterations to intensify pheromone deposition along high-quality paths, accelerating convergence while maintaining solution diversity. Third, a forward-looking mechanism is implemented to penalize redundant path turns, promoting smoother and more efficient solutions. These strategies collectively produce the focused pheromones to guide the ant colony's search, which enhances the global optimization capabilities of the PFACO algorithm, significantly improving convergence speed and solution quality across diverse optimization problems. The experimental results demonstrate that PFACO consistently outperforms comparative ACO algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPFACO\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfACO\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfACO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u76f2\u76ee\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPFACO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8282\u70b9\u6b27\u6c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u96c6\u4e2d\u521d\u59cb\u4fe1\u606f\u7d20\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u4f18\u8d28\u89e3\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u673a\u5236\u60e9\u7f5a\u591a\u4f59\u8def\u5f84\u8f6c\u5f2f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePFACO\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e00\u76f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684ACO\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PFACO\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This contradiction underlies Condorcet's Paradox, a pioneering result of Social Choice Theory, wherein intuitive and seemingly desirable constraints on decision-making necessarily lead to contradictory preference cycles. Topological methods have since broadened Social Choice Theory and elucidated existing results. However, characterisations of preference cycles in Topological Social Choice Theory are lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a framework for topologically modelling preference cycles that generalises Baryshnikov's existing topological model of strict, ordinal preferences on 3 alternatives. In our framework, the contradiction underlying Condorcet's Paradox topologically corresponds to the non-orientability of a surface homeomorphic to either the Klein Bottle or Real Projective Plane, depending on how preference cycles are represented. These findings allow us to reduce Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to a statement about the orientability of a surface.

The idea of redundant assignment is to assign a data vector to more than one IVF lists for reducing the chance of missing true neighbors in IVF search. However, the naive strategy, which selects the second IVF list based on the distance between a data vector and the list centroids, performs poorly. Previous work focuses only on the inner product distance, while there is no optimized list selection study for the most popular Euclidean space. Moreover, the IVF search may access the same vector in more than one lists, resulting in redundant distance computation and decreasing query throughput. In this paper, we present RAIRS to address the above two challenges. For the challenge of the list selection, we propose an optimized AIR metric for the Euclidean space. AIR takes not only distances but also directions into consideration in order to support queries that are closer to the data vector but father away from the first chosen list's centroid. For the challenge of redundant distance computation, we propose SEIL, an optimized list layout that exploits shared cells to reduce repeated distance computations for IVF search. Our experimental results using representative real-world data sets show that RAIRS out-performs existing redundant assignment solutions and achieves up to 1.33x improvement over the best-performing IVF method, IVF-PQ Fast Scan with refinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRAIRS\u89e3\u51b3IVF\u5197\u4f59\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u5217\u8868\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709IVF\u5197\u4f59\u5206\u914d\u5728\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5217\u8868\u9009\u62e9\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u67e5\u8be2\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4f18\u5316AIR\u5ea6\u91cf\u89e3\u51b3\u5217\u8868\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u5217\u8868\u5e03\u5c40SEIL\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRAIRS\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5197\u4f59\u5206\u914d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73IVF\u65b9\u6cd5IVF - PQ Fast Scan with refinement\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u53471.33\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "RAIRS\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86IVF\u7684\u5217\u8868\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u641c\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches rely on aggregate statistical models that capture historical correlations but lack mechanistic interpretability and struggle with novel policy scenarios. We present a general framework for constructing Social Digital Twins - virtual population replicas where Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as cognitive engines for individual agents. Each agent, characterized by demographic and psychographic attributes, receives policy signals and outputs multi-dimensional behavioral probability vectors. A calibration layer maps aggregated agent responses to observable population-level metrics, enabling validation against real-world data and deployment for counterfactual policy analysis.\n  We instantiate this framework in the domain of pandemic response, using COVID-19 as a case study with rich observational data. On a held-out test period, our calibrated digital twin achieves a 20.7% improvement in macro-averaged prediction error over gradient boosting baselines across six behavioral categories. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate monotonic and bounded responses to policy variations, establishing behavioral plausibility. The framework is domain-agnostic: the same architecture applies to transportation policy, economic interventions, environmental regulations, or any setting where policy affects population behavior.

Along with these developments, challenges and opportunities exist in the field of Quantum Software Engineering, as the development of frameworks and higher-level abstractions has attracted practitioners from diverse backgrounds. Unlike initial quantum frameworks based on the circuit model, recent frameworks and libraries leverage higher-level abstractions for creating quantum programs. This paper presents an empirical study of 985 Jupyter Notebooks from 80 open-source projects to investigate how quantum patterns are applied in practice. Our work involved two main stages. First, we built a knowledge base from three quantum computing frameworks (Qiskit, PennyLane, and Classiq). This process led us to identify and document 9 new patterns that refine and extend the existing quantum computing pattern catalog. Second, we developed a reusable semantic search tool to automatically detect these patterns across our large-scale dataset, providing a practitioner-focused analysis. Our results show that developers use patterns in three levels: from foundational circuit utilities, to common algorithmic primitives (e.g., Amplitude Amplification), up to domain-specific applications for finance and optimization.

We integrated historical fire events from NASA FIRMS, daily meteorological observations from Meteostat, and vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Google Earth Engine for the period 2015-2023. After harmonizing the datasets using spatial and temporal joins, we evaluated several machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and an ensemble classifier.

While the Graphical Horseshoe (GHS) method has emerged as a state-of-the-art Bayesian method for sparse precision matrix estimation, existing approaches assume fully observed data and thus fail in the presence of censoring or missingness, which are pervasive in real-world studies. In this paper, we develop the Censored Graphical Horseshoe (CGHS), a novel Bayesian framework that extends the GHS to censored and arbitrarily missing Gaussian data. By introducing a latent-variable representation, CGHS accommodates incomplete observations while retaining the adaptive global-local shrinkage properties of the Horseshoe prior. We derive efficient Gibbs samplers for posterior computation and establish new theoretical results on posterior behavior under censoring and missingness, filling a gap not addressed by frequentist Lasso-based methods. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that CGHS consistently improves estimation accuracy compared to penalized likelihood approaches.

This will continue as next-generation telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) take shape. Under increasingly demanding power consumption, and increasingly challenging radio environments, science goals may become intractable with conventional von Neumann computing due to related power requirements. Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative, and combined with a desire for data-driven methods, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising real-time power-efficient alternative. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection is an attractive use-case for SNNs where recent exploration holds promise. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of deploying varying neuromorphic approaches across key stages in radio astronomy processing pipelines for several existing and near-term instruments. Our analysis paves a realistic path from near-term FPGA deployment of SNNs in existing instruments, allowing the addition of advanced data-driven RFI detection for no capital cost, to neuromorphic ASICs for future instruments, finding that commercially available solutions could reduce the power budget for key processing elements by up to three orders of magnitude, transforming the operational budget of the observatory.

A core model within this paradigm is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where lightweight functions are deployed and triggered on demand, scaling seamlessly with workload. FaaS offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and fine-grained scalability, qualities particularly relevant for large-scale scientific infrastructures where data volumes are too large to centralise and computation must increasingly occur close to the data. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) exemplifies this challenge. Once operational, it will generate about 700~PB of data products annually, distributed across the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet), a federation of international centres providing storage, computing, and analysis services. In such a context, FaaS offers a mechanism to bring computation to the data. We studied the principles of serverless and FaaS computing and explored their application to radio astronomy workflows. Representative functions for astrophysical data analysis were developed and deployed, including micro-functions derived from existing libraries and wrappers around domain-specific applications. In particular, a Gaussian convolution function was implemented and integrated within the SRCNet ecosystem. The use case demonstrates that FaaS can be embedded into the existing SRCNet ecosystem of services, allowing functions to run directly at sites where data replicas are stored. This reduces latency, minimises transfers, and improves efficiency, aligning with federated, data-proximate computation.

We demonstrate SAFER on an autonomous drone system, significantly improving the detection of requirement inconsistencies, enhancing both efficiency and reliability of the safety engineering process.

However, since the splits are chosen locally, interactions are only reliably captured when at least one involved covariate has a marginal effect. We introduce unity forests (UFOs), an RF variant designed to better exploit interactions involving covariates without marginal effects. In UFOs, the first few splits of each tree are optimized jointly across a random covariate subset to form a \"tree root\" capturing such interactions; the remainder is grown conventionally. We further propose the unity variable importance measure (VIM), which is based on out-of-bag split criterion values from the tree roots. Here, only a small fraction of tree root splits with the highest in-bag criterion values are considered per covariate, reflecting that covariates with purely interaction-based effects are discriminative only if a split in an interacting covariate occurred earlier in the tree. Finally, we introduce covariate-representative tree roots (CRTRs), which select representative tree roots per covariate and provide interpretable insight into the conditions - marginal or interactive - under which each covariate has its strongest effects. In a simulation study, the unity VIM reliably identified interacting covariates without marginal effects, unlike conventional RF-based VIMs. In a large-scale real-data comparison, UFOs achieved higher discrimination and predictive accuracy than standard RFs, with comparable calibration.

However, in real-world scenarios, a recommendation method often needs to process different types of behaviors and generate personalized lists for each task (i.e., each behavior type). Such a new recommendation problem is referred to as multi-behavior multi-task recommendation (MMR). So far, the most powerful MBR methods usually model multi-behavior interactions using a cascading graph paradigm. Although significant progress has been made in optimizing the performance of the target behavior, it often neglects the performance of auxiliary behaviors. To compensate for the deficiencies of the cascading paradigm, we propose a novel solution for MMR, i.e., behavior-informed graph embedding learning (BiGEL). Specifically, we first obtain a set of behavior-aware embeddings by using a cascading graph paradigm. Subsequently, we introduce three key modules to improve the performance of the model. The cascading gated feedback (CGF) module enables a feedback-driven optimization process by integrating feedback from the target behavior to refine the auxiliary behaviors preferences. The global context enhancement (GCE) module integrates the global context to maintain the user's overall preferences, preventing the loss of key preferences due to individual behavior graph modeling. Finally, the contrastive preference alignment (CPA) module addresses the potential changes in user preferences during the cascading process by aligning the preferences of the target behaviors with the global preferences through contrastive learning.

Existing length extrapolation methods often suffer from performance degradation or computational inefficiencies. We thereby use a unified framework that reinterprets positional encoding methods as a decomposition of the attention score into a multiplicative transformation and an additive bias. This perspective not only subsumes popular approaches such as relative position embeddings and attention-bias moderated approaches but also exposes their inherent limitations in handling long-range dependencies. To address these shortcomings, motivated by our framework, we introduce Adaptive Positional Encoding (APE), which leverages adaptive frequency modulation and an intricately designed decay bias that incorporates linear, logarithmic, and square-root terms. Our theoretical analysis establishes conditions for infinite-context extrapolation, ensuring that the softmax normalization remains well-defined over unbounded sequences while preserving long-distance correlations, entropy boundedness and gradient positional sensitivity.

These agents differ fundamentally from traditional software: their behavior is not fixed at deployment but continuously shaped by experience, feedback, and context. Applying operational principles inherited from DevOps or MLOps, built for deterministic software and traditional ML systems, assumes that system behavior can be managed through versioning, monitoring, and rollback. This assumption breaks down for Agentic AI systems whose learning trajectories diverge over time. This introduces non-determinism making system reliability a challenge at runtime. We argue that architecting such systems requires a shift from managing control loops to enabling dynamic co-evolution among agents, infrastructure, and human oversight. To guide this shift, we introduce CHANGE, a conceptual framework comprising six capabilities for operationalizing Agentic AI systems: Contextualize, Harmonize, Anticipate, Negotiate, Generate, and Evolve. CHANGE provides a foundation for architecting an AgentOps platform to manage the lifecycle of evolving Agentic AI systems, illustrated through a customer-support system scenario.

Latham", "Andrew Saxe"], "title": "Optimal Learning Rate Schedule for Balancing Effort and Performance", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.NE", "q-bio.NC"], "comment": null, "summary": "Learning how to learn efficiently is a fundamental challenge for biological agents and a growing concern for artificial ones. To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the agent maximizes cumulative performance while incurring a cost of learning. From this objective, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal learning rate, which has the form of a closed-loop controller that depends only on the agent's current and expected future performance. Under mild assumptions, this solution generalizes across tasks and architectures and reproduces numerically optimized schedules in simulations. In simple learning models, we can mathematically analyze how agent and task parameters shape learning-rate scheduling as an open-loop control solution. Because the optimal policy depends on expectations of future performance, the framework predicts how overconfidence or underconfidence influence engagement and persistence, linking the control of learning speed to theories of self-regulated learning. We further show how a simple episodic memory mechanism can approximate the required performance expectations by recalling similar past learning experiences, providing a biologically plausible route to near-optimal behaviour. Together, these results provide a normative and biologically plausible account of learning speed control, linking self-regulated learning, effort allocation, and episodic memory estimation within a unified and tractable mathematical framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u89c4\u8303\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5173\u8054\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u671f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u751f\u7269\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u6536\u76ca\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u80fd\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u4e14\u5177\u751f\u7269\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u52aa\u529b\u5206\u914d\u548c\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Elo\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u7528\uff0cSoft Condorcet Optimization\u5728Atari\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u65f6\u6309\u6bd4\u4f8b\u9009\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6392\u540d\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b97\u6cd5\u62a5\u544a\u6392\u540d\u5e76\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6392\u540d\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u51e0\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548cAtari\u6e38\u620f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u5178\u7684Elo\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6392\u540d\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\uff1bSoft Condorcet Optimization\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0eElo\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728Atari\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eElo\uff1b\u4efb\u52a1\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u6309\u6bd4\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6392\u540d\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u5404\u81ea\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

While large language models have improved semantic assessment, existing ranking paradigms face a persistent trade-off in long-context settings. Pointwise scoring is efficient but often fails to account for list-level interactions, leading to miscalibrated top-$k$ rankings. Listwise approaches can leverage global context, yet they are computationally expensive and become unstable as candidate lists grow. To address this, we propose Residual Listwise Preference Optimization (RLPO), which formulates ranking as listwise representation-level residual correction over a strong pointwise LLM scorer. RLPO first produces calibrated pointwise scores and item representations, then applies a lightweight encoder over the representations to predict listwise score residuals, avoiding full token-level listwise processing. We also introduce a large-scale benchmark for long-context review ranking with human verification.

Drawing on Jung's notion of the collective unconscious as a shared repository of archetypal forms, we introduce an Artificial Collective Unconscious (ACU): a shared dream pool where agents contribute de-identified, abstract Interaction Templates that are later re-instantiated as idiosyncratic Dream Narratives. The Dream Layer runs strictly offline: logic-enforcing modules are relaxed and sampling temperature is increased, yielding safe but deliberately bizarre narratives (e.g., travel sequences with mismatched currencies) that augment data for rare events and edge-case safety tests; to harness risk productively, we add a governance stack of strict abstraction, temporal delays, and ephemeral memory. Through behavioural simulations of everyday dialogue and long-horizon adaptation tasks, we show that the Dream Layer enables a critical decoupling: agents remain firm on safety constraints (e.g., security policies) while becoming flexible in narrative strategy (e.g., using shared archetypal metaphors to resolve deadlocks), conceptually reframing hallucination so that online, unmarked instances remain bugs, whereas bounded, marked, and delayed ones become a goldmine for synthetic scenarios and deepened companionship, echoing anti-overfitting dream mechanisms proposed in contemporary neuroscience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d7\u4e2a\u4eba\u68a6\u5883\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f19\u4f34\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u201c\u68a6\u5883\u5c42\u201d\uff0c\u5c06\u79bb\u7ebf\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5efa\u7acb\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u4e2a\u4eba\u5173\u4e8e\u65e5\u5e38\u786c\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u969c\u788d\u7684\u68a6\u5883\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ece\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8363\u683c\u96c6\u4f53\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u96c6\u4f53\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\uff08ACU\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u5171\u4eab\u68a6\u5883\u6c60\uff1b\u68a6\u5883\u5c42\u4e25\u683c\u79bb\u7ebf\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u653e\u677e\u903b\u8f91\u6a21\u5757\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u65e5\u5e38\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u957f\u671f\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u68a6\u5883\u5c42\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0a\u575a\u5b9a\uff0c\u5728\u53d9\u4e8b\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u5c06\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6df1\u5316\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ecd\u662f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9d\u8d35\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u547c\u5e94\u4e86\u5f53\u4ee3\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6297\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u68a6\u5883\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

This complexity spans not only distributed parallelism strategies (tensor/pipeline/expert) but also intricate framework-specific runtime parameters such as those concerning the enablement of CUDA graphs, available KV-cache memory fractions, and maximum token capacity, which drastically impact performance. The diversity of modern inference frameworks (e.g., TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang), each employing distinct kernels and execution policies, makes manual tuning both framework-specific and computationally prohibitive. We present AIConfigurator, a unified performance-modeling system that enables rapid, framework-agnostic inference configuration search without requiring GPU-based profiling. AIConfigurator combines (1) a methodology that decomposes inference into analytically modelable primitives - GEMM, attention, communication, and memory operations while capturing framework-specific scheduling dynamics; (2) a calibrated kernel-level performance database for these primitives across a wide range of hardware platforms and popular open-weights models (GPT-OSS, Qwen, DeepSeek, LLama, Mistral); and (3) an abstraction layer that automatically resolves optimal launch parameters for the target backend, seamlessly integrating into production-grade orchestration systems. Evaluation on production LLM serving workloads demonstrates that AIConfigurator identifies superior serving configurations that improve performance by up to 40% for dense models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and 50% for MoE architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-V3), while completing searches within 30 seconds on average.

Evaluating LLMs in Resolving Context Adaptation Bugs During Code Adaptation", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI"], "comment": "24 pages, 11 figures, accepted by FSE 2026", "summary": "Code adaptation is a fundamental but challenging task in software development, requiring developers to modify existing code for new contexts. A key challenge is to resolve Context Adaptation Bugs (CtxBugs), which occurs when code correct in its original context violates constraints in the target environment. Unlike isolated bugs, CtxBugs cannot be resolved through local fixes and require cross-context reasoning to identify semantic mismatches. Overlooking them may lead to critical failures in adaptation. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in automating code-related tasks, their ability to resolve CtxBugs remains a significant and unexplored obstacle to their practical use in code adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose CtxBugGen, a novel framework for generating CtxBugs to evaluate LLMs. Its core idea is to leverage LLMs' tendency to generate plausible but context-free code when contextual constraints are absent. The framework generates CtxBugs through a four-step process to ensure their relevance and validity: (1) Adaptation Task Selection, (2) Task-specific Perturbation,(3) LLM-based Variant Generation and (4) CtxBugs Identification. Based on the benchmark constructed by CtxBugGen, we conduct an empirical study with four state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal their unsatisfactory performance in CtxBug resolution. The best performing LLM, Kimi-K2, achieves 55.93% on Pass@1 and resolves just 52.47% of CtxBugs. The presence of CtxBugs degrades LLMs' adaptation performance by up to 30%. Failure analysis indicates that LLMs often overlook CtxBugs and replicate them in their outputs. Our study highlights a critical weakness in LLMs' cross-context reasoning and emphasize the need for new methods to enhance their context awareness for reliable code adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCtxBugGen\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u5e94\u9519\u8bef\uff08CtxBugs\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u89e3\u51b3CtxBugs\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u5176\u8de8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3CtxBugs\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0cLLMs\u89e3\u51b3CtxBugs\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5176\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5904\u7406\u6b64\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCtxBugGen\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u6b65\u751f\u6210CtxBugs\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5176\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u89e3\u51b3CtxBugs\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\u7684Kimi - K2\u7684Pass@1\u4e3a55.93%\uff0c\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b352.47%\u7684CtxBugs\uff0cCtxBugs\u4f7fLLMs\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u591a\u4e0b\u964d30%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u51f8\u663eLLMs\u8de8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u4ee3\u7801\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

Focusing on Optimal Transport (OT), we introduce a novel notion of group fairness requiring that the probability of matching two individuals from any two given groups in the OT plan satisfies a predefined target. We first propose \\texttt{FairSinkhorn}, a modified Sinkhorn algorithm to compute perfectly fair transport plans efficiently. Since exact fairness can significantly degrade matching quality in practice, we then develop two relaxation strategies. The first one involves solving a penalised OT problem, for which we derive novel finite-sample complexity guarantees. This result is of independent interest as it can be generalized to arbitrary convex penalties.

Existing L2C methods oversimplify interaction between human and AI by relying on a single, global user model that neglects individual user variability, leading to suboptimal cooperative performance. Addressing this, we introduce L2CU, a novel L2C framework for human-AI cooperative classification with unseen users.

Invariance learning, an approach that focuses on identifying features invariant across environments, improves model generalization by capturing stable relationships, which may represent causal effects when the data distribution is encoded within a structural equation model (SEM) and satisfies modularity conditions. This has led to a growing body of work that builds on invariance learning, leveraging the inherent heterogeneity across environments to develop methods that provide causal explanations while enhancing robust prediction. However, in many practical scenarios, obtaining complete outcome data from each environment is challenging due to the high cost or complexity of data collection. This limitation in available data hinders the development of models that fully leverage environmental heterogeneity, making it crucial to address missing outcomes to improve both causal insights and robust prediction. In this work, we derive an estimator from the invariance objective under missing outcomes. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees on variable selection property and $\\ell_2$ error convergence rates, which are influenced by the proportion of missing data and the quality of imputation models across environments. We evaluate the performance of the new estimator through extensive simulations and demonstrate its application using the UCI Bike Sharing dataset to predict the count of bike rentals. The results show that despite relying on a biased imputation model, the estimator is efficient and achieves lower prediction error, provided the bias is within a reasonable range.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To bridge these gaps, we propose GAP-Net (Gated Adaptive Progressive Network), a unified framework establishing a \"Triple Gating\" architecture to progressively refine information from micro-level features to macro-level views. GAP-Net operates through three integrated mechanisms: (1) Adaptive Sparse-Gated Attention (ASGA) employs micro-level gating to enforce sparsity, effectively suppressing massive noise activations; (2) Gated Cascading Query Calibration (GCQC) dynamically aligns user intent by bridging real-time triggers and long-term memories via a meso-level cascading channel; and (3) Context-Gated Denoising Fusion (CGDF) performs macro-level modulation to orchestrate the aggregation of multi-view sequences.

This is due to the finite precision effects of the arithmetic operations, which depend on the order in which they are executed. This order, in turn, depends on the processes that are running concurrently on the GPU. Previous studies have focused on the impact of nondeterminism on the text generated by the LLMs or on proposing mechanisms to achieve deterministic execution. This work takes a closer look at nondeterminism by analyzing the variations on the token probabilities, not on the generated text. Interestingly, all the models evaluated have similar results in both the trends and the actual values of the variations of the probabilities. In particular, the results show that the effects of nondeterminism are significant for token probabilities that are in the range of 0.1 to 0.9, while they are much smaller when the probabilities are close to 0 or 1. This has significant implications for our understanding of nondeterminism. The first is that nondeterminism will likely have a non-negligible impact on generated text when the temperature is not zero, as it introduces significant variations in the token probabilities except when they are close to 0 or 1. Secondly, it suggests that all models have similar non deterministic variations at the token probability level. Therefore, different variations in the performance of the generated text, for example, when measuring accuracy on a benchmark, seem to come from different token probabilities or response lengths. A third implication is that we may be able to estimate the impact of nondeterminism by running a single inference and analyzing the token level probabilities, instead of having to run the same inference many times.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u8303\u56f4\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6216\u5b9e\u73b0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6267\u884c\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u60f3\u4ece\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6982\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u503c\u4e0a\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf90.1 - 0.9\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd10\u62161\u65f6\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e3a0\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u5c42\u9762\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u76f8\u4f3c\uff1b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u6790\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

The study employed a structured questionnaire administered to professionals from Science and Technology Institutions (STIs) located in Manaus, Brazil, aiming to capture reported practices, perceptions of quality, and recurrent challenges. Quantitative data were complemented by qualitative responses to support contextual interpretation.

While text has traditionally served as the medium for inter-model communication, a richer and more efficient exchange is possible if models can access each other's internal states directly. In this paper, we propose learning a shared representation space that aligns the k-v caches of multiple models, creating a high-bandwidth channel for collaboration without altering the underlying pre-trained parameters. We do so by augmenting each model with adapters to translate its state into and out of this shared space. Via a suite of experiments with Gemma-2 models, we demonstrate that this approach not only enables seamless inter-model communication but also improves individual model performance. We also show that the shared space allows for the direct transfer of learned skills, such as soft prompts, between different models.

In this paper, we propose a complementary approach by introducing a covariance-driven splitting criterion for regression trees (CovRT). This method is more robust to overfitting than the empirical risk minimization criterion used in CART, as it produces more balanced and stable splits and more effectively identifies covariates with true signals. We establish an oracle inequality of CovRT and prove that its predictive accuracy is comparable to that of CART in high-dimensional settings.

Existing end-to-end paradigms, which typically treat dashboard generation as a direct code generation task (e.g., raw HTML), suffer from two fundamental limitations: representation redundancy due to massive tokens spent on visual rendering, and low controllability caused by the entanglement of analytical reasoning and presentation. To address these challenges, we propose NL2Dashboard, a lightweight framework grounded in the principle of Analysis-Presentation Decoupling. We introduce a structured intermediate representation (IR) that encapsulates the dashboard's content, layout, and visual elements. Therefore, it confines the LLM's role to data analysis and intent translation, while offloading visual synthesis to a deterministic rendering engine. Building upon this framework, we develop a multi-agent system in which the IR-driven algorithm is instantiated as a suite of tools.

Compared to SVM (90.1%), ANN (94.7%), and Bayes Net (94.9), AdaBoost achieved higher performance with a 98.0% ACC, 98.3% PRE, 98.0% REC, and F1-score (F1). The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) study, which provided further confirmation of its strength, yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98.

Fairness issues have attracted increasing attention since machine learning software is increasingly used for high-stakes and high-risk decisions. It is the responsibility of all software developers to make their software accountable by ensuring that the machine learning software do not perform differently on different sensitive groups -- satisfying the separation criterion. However, evaluation of separation requires ground truth labels for each test data point. This motivates our work on analyzing whether separation can be evaluated on comparative judgment test data. Instead of asking humans to provide the ratings or categorical labels on each test data point, comparative judgments are made between pairs of data points such as A is better than B. According to the law of comparative judgment, providing such comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden for humans than providing ratings or categorical labels. This work first defines the novel fairness notion comparative separation on comparative judgment test data, and the metrics to evaluate comparative separation. Then, both theoretically and empirically, we show that in binary classification problems, comparative separation is equivalent to separation. Lastly, we analyze the number of test data points and test data pairs required to achieve the same level of statistical power in the evaluation of separation and comparative separation, respectively. This work is the first to explore fairness evaluation on comparative judgment test data. It shows the feasibility and the practical benefits of using comparative judgment test data for model evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u79bb\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u5224\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u79bb\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u9700\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u5224\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u6bd4\u8f83\u5224\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u79bb\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u660e\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u5206\u79bb\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u8005\u8fbe\u76f8\u540c\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u5206\u79bb\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u51fa\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u5224\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u76ca\u5904\u3002"}}

This paper develops a lightweight estimator for minimally-congested car travel times that integrates open road-network data, speed constraints, and sparse control/turn features within a random forest framework to correct bias from shortest-path traversal-time baselines. Using an urban testbed, the pipeline: (i) constructs drivable networks from volunteered geographic data; (ii) solves Dijkstra routes minimizing edge traversal time; (iii) derives sparse operational features (signals, stops, crossings, yield, roundabouts; left/right/slight/U-turn counts); and (iv) trains a regression ensemble on limited high-quality reference times to generalize predictions beyond the training set. Out-of-sample evaluation demonstrates marked improvements over traversal-time baselines across mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, mean squared error, relative bias, and explained variance, with no significant mean bias under minimally congested conditions and consistent k-fold stability indicating negligible overfitting. The resulting approach offers a practical middle ground for transportation engineering: it preserves point-to-point fidelity at metropolitan scale, reduces resource requirements, and supplies defensible performance estimates where congestion feeds are inaccessible or cost-prohibitive, supporting planning, accessibility, and network performance applications under low-traffic operating regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f30\u7b97\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u62e5\u5835\u8def\u6bb5\u6c7d\u8f66\u884c\u9a76\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u901a\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6298\u4e2d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8def\u51b5\u4ea4\u901a\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u62e5\u5835\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u7b80\u5355\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u5f00\u653e\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u63a7\u5236/\u8f6c\u5f2f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fee\u6b63\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u904d\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9a7e\u9a76\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u6c42\u89e3Dijkstra\u8def\u7ebf\u3001\u63a8\u5bfc\u7a00\u758f\u64cd\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u65f6\u95f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u56de\u5f52\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6bd4\u904d\u5386\u65f6\u95f4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u62e5\u5835\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\uff0ck\u6298\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4ea4\u901a\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6298\u4e2d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u62e5\u5835\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u6216\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Current approaches remain fragmented within disciplinary boundaries, limiting comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis across different space types. This study develops a systematic, data-driven framework for assessing public space quality through the algorithmic integration of empirical research findings. Using a 7-phase methodology, we transform 1,207 quality factors extracted from 157 peer-reviewed studies into a validated hierarchical taxonomy spanning six public space typologies: urban spaces, open spaces, green spaces, parks and waterfronts, streets and squares, and public facilities. The methodology combines semantic analysis, cross-typology distribution analysis, and domain knowledge integration to address terminological variations and functional relationships across space types.

In this paper, we propose a robust data augmentation method, AISCycleGen, based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN), which is tailored for AIS datasets. Unlike traditional methods, AISCycleGen leverages unpaired domain translation to generate high-fidelity synthetic AIS data sequences without requiring paired source-target data. The framework employs a 1D convolutional generator with adaptive noise injection to preserve the spatiotemporal structure of AIS trajectories, enhancing the diversity and realism of the generated data.

Copyright 2026 by the authors", "summary": "Over-smoothing and over-squashing have been extensively studied in the literature on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) over the past years. We challenge this prevailing focus in GNN research, arguing that these phenomena are less critical for practical applications than assumed. We suggest that performance decreases often stem from uninformative receptive fields rather than over-smoothing. We support this position with extensive experiments on several standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating that accuracy and over-smoothing are mostly uncorrelated and that optimal model depths remain small even with mitigation techniques, thus highlighting the negligible role of over-smoothing. Similarly, we challenge that over-squashing is always detrimental in practical applications. Instead, we posit that the distribution of relevant information over the graph frequently factorises and is often localised within a small k-hop neighbourhood, questioning the necessity of jointly observing entire receptive fields or engaging in an extensive search for long-range interactions. The results of our experiments show that architectural interventions designed to mitigate over-squashing fail to yield significant performance gains. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in theoretical research, urging a diligent analysis of learning tasks and datasets using statistics that measure the underlying distribution of label-relevant information to better understand their localisation and factorisation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u8fc7\u6324\u538b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53e6\u6709\u66f4\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8fd8\u547c\u5401\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u8fc7\u6324\u538b\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e76\u975e\u50cf\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u90a3\u4e48\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u5927\u591a\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u4ecd\u5c0f\uff1b\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u6324\u538b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5e72\u9884\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u547c\u5401\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e94\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u7406\u89e3\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002"}}

At inference, fixed structured prompts bind the active scenario to the agent profile, yielding behavior that is stable yet context-sensitive. We instantiate IS and MSC to synthesize supervision (role-play dialogues, decision probes, feedback trajectories) and then fine-tune a small LLM. The resulting model produces consistent, identifiable persona-aligned behaviors for specified Big Five configurations and matches or exceeds several larger untuned LLMs and other untuned baselines on our metrics: persona consistency, contextual appropriateness, style matching, trait identifiability, and long-horizon stability.

However, their integration with online reinforcement learning remains challenging due to fundamental incompatibilities between diffusion model training objectives and standard RL policy improvement mechanisms. This paper presents the first comprehensive review and empirical analysis of current Online Diffusion Policy Reinforcement Learning (Online DPRL) algorithms for scalable robotic control systems. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing approaches into four distinct families -- Action-Gradient, Q-Weighting, Proximity-Based, and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) methods -- based on their policy improvement mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on a unified NVIDIA Isaac Lab benchmark encompassing 12 diverse robotic tasks, we systematically evaluate representative algorithms across five critical dimensions: task diversity, parallelization capability, diffusion step scalability, cross-embodiment generalization, and environmental robustness.

The problem is formally posed as the task of partitioning the arms of an N-armed stochastic bandit according to their underlying distributions, grouping two arms together if and only if they share the same distribution, using samples collected sequentially and adaptively. This setting has gained attention in recent years due to its applicability in recommendation systems and crowdsourcing. Existing works on clustering with bandit feedback rely on a strong assumption that the underlying distributions are sub-Gaussian. As a consequence, the existing methods mainly cover settings with linearly-separable clusters, which has little practical relevance. We introduce a framework of ``nonparametric clustering with bandit feedback'', where the underlying arm distributions are not constrained to any parametric, and hence, it is applicable for active clustering of real-world datasets. We adopt a kernel-based approach, which allows us to reformulate the nonparametric problem as the task of clustering the arms according to their kernel mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Building on this formulation, we introduce the KABC algorithm with theoretical correctness guarantees and analyze its sampling budget. We introduce a notion of signal-to-noise ratio for this problem that depends on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between the arm distributions and on their variance in the RKHS. Our algorithm is adaptive to this unknown quantity: it does not require it as an input yet achieves instance-dependent guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e26\u8001\u864e\u673a\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cKABC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u4e14\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u77e5\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e26\u8001\u864e\u673a\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u5047\u8bbe\u5206\u5e03\u4e3a\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u9700\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5728\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8001\u864e\u673a\u81c2\u7684\u6838\u5747\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faKABC\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u548cKABC\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u805a\u7c7b\u3002"}}

This geometric collapse renders the model \"blind\" to high-value solutions that lie within its Null Space. To address this, we propose Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE), a geometric framework operating on a counter-intuitive \"Student Guides Teacher\" paradigm. Specifically, we utilize a weak auxiliary agent not for imitation, but as an orthogonal probe. By explicitly navigating the Teacher's Null Space, SOE serves as a geometric bridge, effectively ejecting the model from local optima to explore diverse, high-value solution spaces.

Traditional syntax and semantic-based parsers often struggle with semantic variations in evolving logs and data scarcity stemming from their limited domain coverage. Recent large language model (LLM)-based parsers leverage in-context learning (ICL) to extract semantics from examples, demonstrating superior accuracy. However, LLM-based parsers face two main challenges: 1) underutilization of ICL capabilities, particularly in dynamic example selection and cross-domain generalization, leading to inconsistent performance; 2) time-consuming and costly LLM querying. To address these challenges, we present MicLog, the first progressive meta in-context learning (ProgMeta-ICL) log parsing framework that combines meta-learning with ICL on small open-source LLMs (i.e., Qwen-2.5-3B). Specifically, MicLog: i) enhances LLMs' ICL capability through a zero-shot to k-shot ProgMeta-ICL paradigm, employing weighted DBSCAN candidate sampling and enhanced BM25 demonstration selection; ii) accelerates parsing via a multi-level pre-query cache that dynamically matches and refines recently parsed templates.

However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI.

Accurate multi-step forecasting of time series systems is important for the automatic control and optimization of physical processes, enabling more precise decision-making. While mechanistic-based and data-driven machine learning (ML) approaches have been employed for time series forecasting, they face significant limitations. Incomplete knowledge of process mathematical models limits mechanistic-based direct employment, while purely data-driven ML models struggle with dynamic environments, leading to poor generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a dual-level strategy for physics-informed forecasting of dynamical systems. On the first level, input variables are forecast using a hybrid method that integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM) network into probabilistic state transition models (STMs). On the second level, these stochastically predicted inputs are sequentially fed into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to generate multi-step output predictions. The experimental results of the paper demonstrate that the hybrid input forecasting models achieve a higher log-likelihood and lower mean squared errors (MSE) compared to conventional STMs. Furthermore, the PINNs driven by the input forecasting models outperform their purely data-driven counterparts in terms of MSE and log-likelihood, exhibiting stronger generalization and forecasting performance across multiple test cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u6982\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u7406\u548c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ea7\u7528\u878d\u5408\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f51\u7edc\uff08LSTM\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ea7\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4f9d\u5e8f\u8f93\u5165\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINN\uff09\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6b65\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684PINN\u5728\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We term this disconnect the allocation gap and provide a decision-theoretic explanation by modelling healthcare delivery as a stochastic allocation problem under binding resource constraints. In this framework, AI acts as decision infrastructure that estimates utility rather than making autonomous decisions.

Yet, their adoption within agile environments remains underexplored. Objective: This study investigates how agile practitioners adopt GenAI tools in real-world organizational contexts, focusing on regulatory conditions, use cases, benefits, and barriers. Method: An exploratory multiple case study was conducted in three German organizations, involving 17 semi-structured interviews and document analysis. A cross-case thematic analysis was applied to identify GenAI adoption patterns. Results: Findings reveal that GenAI is primarily used for creative tasks, documentation, and code assistance. Benefits include efficiency gains and enhanced creativity, while barriers relate to data privacy, validation effort, and lack of governance. Using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, we find that these barriers stem from misalignments across the three dimensions. Regulatory pressures are often translated into policies without accounting for actual technological usage patterns or organizational constraints. This leads to systematic gaps between policy and practice.

Detecting absence depends on expectations about what should be there, yet interfaces rarely help users form such expectations. We present an experimental study examining how reference framing and prompting influence people's ability to recognize expected but missing categories in datasets. Participants compared distributions across three domains (energy, wealth, and regime) under two reference conditions: Global, presenting a unified population baseline, and Partial, showing several concrete exemplars. Results indicate that absence detection was higher with Partial reference than with Global reference, suggesting that partial, samples-based framing can support expectation formation and absence detection. When participants were prompted to look for what was missing, absence detection rose sharply. We discuss implications for interactive user interfaces and expectation-based visualization design, while considering cognitive trade-offs of reference structures and guided attention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u4eba\u4eec\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u8003\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u7f3a\u5931\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u9884\u671f\u4f46\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u5f62\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u5fc3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u754c\u9762\u5f88\u5c11\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u5f62\u6210\u9884\u671f\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8ba9\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u53c2\u8003\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5168\u7403\u53c2\u8003\u5448\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u8003\u5c55\u793a\u5177\u4f53\u6837\u672c\uff09\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6709\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u8003\u4e0b\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5168\u7403\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u7f3a\u5931\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u90e8\u5206\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u9884\u671f\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5bf9\u4ea4\u4e92\u754c\u9762\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u8ba4\u77e5\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Although PDHG-based solvers have shown strong performance on single-node GPU architectures, their applicability to industrial-scale instances is often limited by GPU memory capacity and computational throughput. To overcome these challenges, we extend the PDHG framework to a distributed-memory setting via a practical two-dimensional grid partitioning of the constraint matrix, enabling scalable execution across multiple GPUs. Our implementation leverages the NCCL communication backend to efficiently synchronize primal-dual updates across devices. To improve load balance and computational efficiency, we introduce a block-wise random shuffling strategy combined with nonzero-aware data distribution, and further accelerate computation through fused CUDA kernels. By distributing both memory and computation, the proposed framework not only overcomes the single-GPU memory bottleneck but also achieves substantial speedups by exploiting multi-GPU parallelism with relatively low communication overhead.

In recent years, time-series forecasting approaches have been extensively applied to GNSS station-based precipitation nowcasting. However, the highly imbalanced temporal distribution of precipitation, marked not only by the dominance of non-rainfall events but also by the scarcity of extreme precipitation samples, significantly limits model performance in practical applications. To address the dual imbalance problem in precipitation nowcasting, we propose a continuous probability modeling-based framework, RainBalance. This plug-and-play module performs clustering for each input sample to obtain its cluster probability distribution, which is further mapped into a continuous latent space via a variational autoencoder (VAE). By learning in this continuous probabilistic space, the task is reformulated from fitting single and imbalance-prone precipitation labels to modeling continuous probabilistic label distributions, thereby alleviating the imbalance issue. We integrate this module into multiple state-of-the-art models and observe consistent performance gains.

Family data from ground testing or previous flights is commonly used to detect initiating failure modes and their timing; however, this approach relies heavily on engineering judgment and is more error-prone for new launch vehicles. To address these limitations, we utilize Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for supervised classification of time-series anomalies. Although, initial training labels derived from simulated anomaly data may be suboptimal due to variations in anomaly strength, anomaly settling times, and other factors.

Many methods have been proposed in the literature to enhance software fairness. However, the majority behave as a black-box, not allowing stakeholders to prioritise fairness or effectiveness (i.e., prediction correctness) based on their needs. Aims: In this paper, we introduce FairRF, a novel approach based on multi-objective evolutionary search to optimise fairness and effectiveness in classification tasks. FairRF uses a Random Forest (RF) model as a base classifier and searches for the best hyperparameter configurations and data mutation to maximise fairness and effectiveness. Eventually, it returns a set of Pareto optimal solutions, allowing the final stakeholders to choose the best one based on their needs. Method: We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of FairRF against 26 different baselines in 11 different scenarios using five effectiveness and three fairness metrics. Additionally, we also include two variations of the fairness metrics for intersectional bias for a total of six definitions analysed. Result: Our results show that FairRF can significantly improve the fairness of base classifiers, while maintaining consistent prediction effectiveness. Additionally, FairRF provides a more consistent optimisation under all fairness definitions compared to state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods and overcomes the existing state-of-the-art approach for intersectional bias mitigation.

Block models form a standard approach to partition nodes according to a graph model, facilitating the analysis and interpretation of the network structure. By grouping nodes with similar connection patterns, they enable the identification of a wide variety of underlying structures. The degree-corrected block model (DCBM) is an established model that accounts for the heterogeneity of node degrees. However, existing inference methods for the DCBM are heuristics that are highly sensitive to initialization, typically done randomly. In this work, we show that DCBM inference can be reformulated as a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization problem. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel method for community detection and a theoretically well-grounded initialization strategy that provides an initial estimate of communities for inference algorithms. Our approach is agnostic to any specific network structure and applies to graphs with any structure representable by a DCBM, not only assortative ones. Experiments on synthetic and real benchmark networks show that our method detects communities comparable to those found by DCBM inference, while scaling linearly with the number of edges and communities; for instance, it processes a graph with 100,000 nodes and 2,000,000 edges in approximately 4 minutes. Moreover, the proposed initialization strategy significantly improves solution quality and reduces the number of iterations required by all tested inference algorithms. Overall, this work provides a scalable and robust framework for community detection and highlights the benefits of a matrix-factorization perspective for the DCBM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2dDCBM\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DCBM\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06DCBM\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u68c0\u6d4b\u793e\u533a\u6548\u679c\u4e0eDCBM\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9DCBM\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating 29 LLMs on object-oriented design (OOD) tasks. Owing to the lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics, we introduce OODEval, a manually constructed benchmark comprising 50 OOD tasks of varying difficulty, and OODEval-Human, the first human-rated OOD benchmark, which includes 940 undergraduate-submitted class diagrams evaluated by instructors. We further propose CLUE (Class Likeness Unified Evaluation), a unified metric set that assesses both global correctness and fine-grained design quality in class diagram generation. Using these benchmarks and metrics, we investigate five research questions: overall correctness, comparison with humans, model dimension analysis, task feature analysis, and bad case analysis. The results indicate that while LLMs achieve high syntactic accuracy, they exhibit substantial semantic deficiencies, particularly in method and relationship generation. Among the evaluated models, Qwen3-Coder-30B achieves the best overall performance, rivaling DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4o, while Gemma3-4B-IT outperforms GPT-4o-Mini despite its smaller parameter scale. Although top-performing LLMs nearly match the average performance of undergraduates, they remain significantly below the level of the best human designers. Further analysis shows that parameter scale, code specialization, and instruction tuning strongly influence performance, whereas increased design complexity and lower requirement readability degrade it.

Deep learning approaches have been constrained by the scarcity of CTG recordings with clinical outcome labels. We present the first application of self-supervised pre-training to intrapartum CTG analysis, leveraging 2,444 hours of unlabeled recordings for masked pre-training followed by fine-tuning on the 552-recording CTU-UHB benchmark. Using a PatchTST transformer architecture with a channel-asymmetric masking scheme designed for fetal heart rate reconstruction, we achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 on the full test set and 0.853 on uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, exceeding previously reported results on this benchmark (0.68-0.75). Error analysis reveals that false-positive alerts typically correspond to CTG patterns judged concerning on retrospective clinical review, suggesting clinically meaningful predictions even when umbilical pH is normal.

To address this limitation, we introduce the Personality-aware Commonsense Knowledge Graph (PCoKG), a structured dataset comprising 521,316 quadruples. We begin by employing three evaluators to score and filter events from the ATOMIC dataset, selecting those that are likely to elicit diverse reasoning patterns across different personality types. For knowledge graph construction, we leverage the role-playing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning tasks. To enhance the quality of the generated knowledge, we incorporate a debate mechanism consisting of a proponent, an opponent, and a judge, which iteratively refines the outputs through feedback loops. We evaluate the dataset from multiple perspectives and conduct fine-tuning and ablation experiments using multiple LLM backbones to assess PCoKG's robustness and the effectiveness of its construction pipeline. Our LoRA-based fine-tuning results indicate a positive correlation between model performance and the parameter scale of the base models.

On a 37,346-example camera metadata benchmark across six model families, we find severe format collapse (for example, Gemma-2B: ROS 0.116 versus CSS 0.246) and large cross-model portability gaps (0.4 to 0.6 F1). We then present PromptPort, a reliability layer combining deterministic canonicalization with a lightweight verifier (DistilBERT) and a safe-override policy. PromptPort recovers format failures (plus 6 to 8 F1), adds verifier-driven semantic selection (plus 14 to 16 F1 beyond canonicalization), and approaches per-field oracle performance (0.890 versus 0.896 in zero-shot) without modifying base models. The method generalizes to held-out model families and provides explicit abstention when uncertain, enabling reliable structured extraction in production deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs \u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u56e0\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u683c\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa PromptPort \u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3 LLMs \u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u56e0\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u800c\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 ROS \u548c CSS \u53cc\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa PromptPort\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8986\u76d6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u683c\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1bPromptPort \u4fee\u590d\u683c\u5f0f\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5355\u5b57\u6bb5\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u672a\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u660e\u786e\u5f03\u6743\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u4ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u3002"}}

However, existing time series foundation models primarily focus on forecasting tasks and often overlook classification-specific challenges, such as modeling interpretable shapelets that capture class-discriminative temporal features. To bridge this gap, we propose UniShape, a unified shape-aware foundation model designed for time series classification. UniShape incorporates a shape-aware adapter that adaptively aggregates multiscale discriminative subsequences (shapes) into class tokens, effectively selecting the most relevant subsequence scales to enhance model interpretability. Meanwhile, a prototype-based pretraining module is introduced to jointly learn instance- and shape-level representations, enabling the capture of transferable shape patterns. Pre-trained on a large-scale multi-domain time series dataset comprising 1.89 million samples, UniShape exhibits superior generalization across diverse target domains.

As a result, when a client requests data deletion, its influence is implicitly embedded throughout the system, making removal difficult without centralized coordination. We propose a novel certified unlearning framework for DFL based on Newton-style updates. Our approach first quantifies how a client's data influence propagates during training. Leveraging curvature information of the loss with respect to the target data, we then construct corrective updates using Newton-style approximations. To ensure scalability, we approximate second-order information via Fisher information matrices. The resulting updates are perturbed with calibrated noise and broadcast through the network to eliminate residual influence across clients. We theoretically prove that our approach satisfies the formal definition of certified unlearning, ensuring that the unlearned model is difficult to distinguish from a retrained model without the deleted data. We also establish utility bounds showing that the unlearned model remains close to retraining from scratch. Extensive experiments across diverse decentralized settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u725b\u987f\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5378\u8f7d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6ee1\u8db3\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5378\u8f7d\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DFL\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u5378\u8f7d\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0cDFL\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\u96be\u6d88\u9664\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u725b\u987f\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u6784\u9020\u7ea0\u6b63\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u6821\u51c6\u566a\u58f0\u6d88\u9664\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6ee1\u8db3\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5378\u8f7d\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u65e0\u5220\u9664\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6548\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied to this task, most existing frameworks rely on geometry-driven methods that require extensive preprocessing, suffer from information loss, and offer limited interpretability. This study proposes a methodology that evaluates manufacturability directly from parametric design features, enabling explicit incorporation of dimensional tolerances without requiring computer-aided design (CAD) processing. The approach employs Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn functional relationships between design parameters, tolerances, and manufacturability outcomes. A synthetic dataset of 300,000 labeled designs is generated to evaluate performance across three representative scenarios: hole drilling, pocket milling, and combined drilling-milling, while accounting for machining constraints and design-for-manufacturing (DFM) rules. Benchmarking against fourteen machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models shows that KAN achieves the highest performance in all scenarios, with AUC values of 0.9919 for drilling, 0.9841 for milling, and 0.9406 for the combined case. The proposed framework provides high interpretability through spline-based functional visualizations and latent-space projections, enabling identification of the design and tolerance parameters that most strongly influence manufacturability. An industrial case study further demonstrates how the framework enables iterative, parameter-level design modifications that transform a non-manufacturable component into a manufacturable one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528KAN\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\u4e0e\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793aKAN\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e14\u7ecf\u5de5\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u9884\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Kolmogorov - Arnold Networks\uff08KANs\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd414\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "KAN\u5728\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u94bb\u5b54AUC\u503c0.9919\uff0c\u94e3\u524a0.9841\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u60c5\u51b50.9406\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fee\u6539\u5c06\u4e0d\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Cyber-attacks include various threats such as ransomware, malware, phishing, and Denial of Service (DoS)-related attacks. Challenges: Traditional models such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Security Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) were implemented to detect cyber threats. However, the existing Security BERT model has a limited contextual understanding of text data, which has less impact on detecting cyber-attacks. Proposed Methodology: To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model is proposed which consists of diverse words of vocabulary understanding. Initially, data are extracted from a Packet Capture (PCAP) file and encrypted using Fully Harmonic Encryption (FHE). Subsequently, a Byte-level and Byte Pair Encoding (BBPE) tokenizer was used to generate tokens and help maintain the vocabulary for the encrypted values. Then, these values are applied to the RoBERTa model of the transformer with extensive training. Finally, Softmax is used for the detection and classification of attacks.

Since a first study yielded inconclusive results, a second study with improved methodology (i.e., systematic information extraction and different prediction outcome) was conducted. In Study 1, some pretrained random forests descriptively outperformed the standard random forest. However, this improvement was not significant (t(99) = 0.89, p = 0.19).

In this study, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to investigate how a DiT can generate correct spatial relations between objects. We train, from scratch, DiTs of different sizes with different text encoders to learn to generate images containing two objects whose attributes and spatial relations are specified in the text prompt. We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder. When using random text embeddings, we find that the spatial-relation information is passed to image tokens through a two-stage circuit, involving two cross-attention heads that separately read the spatial relation and single-object attributes in the text prompt. When using a pretrained text encoder (T5), we find that the DiT uses a different circuit that leverages information fusion in the text tokens, reading spatial-relation and single-object information together from a single text token.

Existing approaches to generating privacy notices or just privacy captions include using questionnaires, templates, static analysis, or machine learning.

However, extending multi-concept unlearning to large-scale scenarios remains difficult due to three challenges: (i) conflicting weight updates that hinder unlearning or degrade generation; (ii) imprecise mechanisms that cause collateral damage to similar content; and (iii) reliance on additional data or modules, creating scalability bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Scalable-Precise Concept Unlearning (ScaPre), a unified framework tailored for large-scale unlearning. ScaPre introduces a conflict-aware stable design, integrating spectral trace regularization and geometry alignment to stabilize optimization, suppress conflicts, and preserve global structure. Furthermore, an Informax Decoupler identifies concept-relevant parameters and adaptively reweights updates, strictly confining unlearning to the target subspace. ScaPre yields an efficient closed-form solution without requiring auxiliary data or sub-models. Comprehensive experiments on objects, styles, and explicit content demonstrate that ScaPre effectively removes target concepts while maintaining generation quality.

We present CARD, a hierarchical framework that achieves effective personalization through progressive refinement. CARD first clusters users according to shared stylistic patterns and learns cluster-specific LoRA adapters, enabling robust generalization and strong low-resource performance. To capture individual differences within each cluster, we propose an implicit preference learning mechanism that contrasts user-authored text with cluster-level generations, allowing the model to infer user-specific style preferences without manual annotation. At inference time, CARD injects personalization exclusively at decoding via lightweight user preference vectors and low-rank logit corrections, while keeping the base model frozen.

We argue that large language models (LLMs) have democratized web scraping, enabling low-skill users to execute sophisticated operations through simple natural language prompts. While extensive benchmarks evaluate these tools under optimal expert conditions, we show that without extensive manual effort, current LLM-based workflows allow novice users to scrape complex websites that would otherwise be inaccessible. We systematically benchmark what everyday users can do with off-the-shelf LLM tools across 35 sites spanning five security tiers, including authentication, anti-bot, and CAPTCHA controls. We devise and evaluate two distinct workflows: (a) LLM-assisted scripting, where users prompt LLMs to generate traditional scraping code but maintain manual execution control, and (b) end-to-end LLM agents, which autonomously navigate and extract data through integrated tool use. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end agents have made complex scraping accessible - requiring as little as a single prompt with minimal refinement (less than 5 changes) to complete workflows. We also highlight scenarios where LLM-assisted scripting may be simpler and faster for static sites. In light of these findings, we provide simple procedures for novices to use these workflows and gauge what adversaries could achieve using these.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u6293\u53d6\u5e73\u6c11\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9LLMs\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b89\u5168\u7b49\u7ea7\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e24\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4ee3\u7406\u8ba9\u590d\u6742\u6293\u53d6\u53d8\u5f97\u5bb9\u6613\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u65b0\u624b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7f51\u7edc\u6293\u53d6\u9700\u4e13\u4e1a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u800cLLMs\u867d\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u666e\u901a\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u666e\u901a\u7528\u6237\u7528LLMs\u5de5\u5177\u8fdb\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u6293\u53d6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf935\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u811a\u672c\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aefLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4e24\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4ee3\u7406\u4f7f\u590d\u6742\u6293\u53d6\u53d8\u5f97\u5bb9\u6613\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff1bLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u811a\u672c\u5728\u9759\u6001\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u5feb\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u65b0\u624b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u624b\u53ef\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u8fbe\u6210\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

PGAR computes three reflex-level signals (incident detection, overconfidence correction, and recovery memory) and fuses them into a bounded reliability index in [0,1]. This index continuously modulates the learner's effective learning rate, reducing update magnitude during instability and restoring it as reliability improves. We provide a Lyapunov-based proof sketch establishing bounded adaptation of the reliability dynamics under mild assumptions (smooth loss, descent direction, and bounded reflex outputs).

In the present work, we identify a general mechanism, in terms of an explicit geometric correction of the learning dynamics, for the emergence of implicit biases, arising from the interaction between continuous symmetries in the model's parametrization and stochasticity in the optimization process. Our viewpoint is constructive in two complementary directions: given model symmetries, one can derive the implicit bias they induce; conversely, one can inverse-design a wide class of different implicit biases by computing specific redundant parameterizations. More precisely, we show that, when the dynamics is expressed in the quotient space obtained by factoring out the symmetry group of the parameterization, the resulting stochastic differential equation gains a closed form geometric correction in the stationary distribution of the optimizer dynamics favoring orbits with small local volume. We compute the resulting symmetry induced bias for a range of architectures, showing how several well known results fit into a single unified framework. The approach also provides a practical methodology for deriving implicit biases in new settings, and it yields concrete, testable predictions that we confirm by numerical simulations on toy models trained on synthetic data, leaving more complex scenarios for future work.

To address this, we present a comprehensive benchmark suite that evaluates robustness across multiple perturbation types, including general text edits (e.g., punctuation, whitespace), formatting changes (e.g., JSON, YAML), multilingual and cross-lingual inputs, and positional variations in instructions. Evaluating 11 models ranging from 4B to 120B+ parameters, we find that minor perturbations reduce performance by up to 40 percentage points on key enterprise metrics.

Inspired by cognitive theories, we propose HiMem, a hierarchical long-term memory framework for long-horizon dialogues, designed to support memory construction, retrieval, and dynamic updating during sustained interactions. HiMem constructs cognitively consistent Episode Memory via a Topic-Aware Event--Surprise Dual-Channel Segmentation strategy, and builds Note Memory that captures stable knowledge through a multi-stage information extraction pipeline. These two memory types are semantically linked to form a hierarchical structure that bridges concrete interaction events and abstract knowledge, enabling efficient retrieval without sacrificing information fidelity. HiMem supports both hybrid and best-effort retrieval strategies to balance accuracy and efficiency, and incorporates conflict-aware Memory Reconsolidation to revise and supplement stored knowledge based on retrieval feedback. This design enables continual memory self-evolution over long-term use. Experimental results on long-horizon dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that HiMem consistently outperforms representative baselines in accuracy, consistency, and long-term reasoning, while maintaining favorable efficiency.

Existing guarantees for score estimation largely focus on light-tailed targets or rely on restrictive assumptions such as compact support, which are often violated by heavy-tailed data in practice. In this work, we study conventional (Gaussian) score-based diffusion models when the target distribution is heavy-tailed and belongs to a Sobolev class with smoothness parameter $\u03b2>0$. We consider both exponential and polynomial tail decay, indexed by a tail parameter $\u03b3$. Using kernel density estimation, we derive sharp minimax rates for score estimation, revealing a qualitative dichotomy: under exponential tails, the rate matches the light-tailed case up to polylogarithmic factors, whereas under polynomial tails the rate depends explicitly on $\u03b3$. We further provide sampling guarantees for the associated continuous reverse dynamics. In total variation, the generated distribution converges at the minimax optimal rate $n^{-\u03b2/(2\u03b2+d)}$ under exponential tails (up to logarithmic factors), and at a $\u03b3$-dependent rate under polynomial tails. Whether the latter sampling rate is minimax optimal remains an open question. These results characterize the statistical limits of score estimation and the resulting sampling accuracy for heavy-tailed targets, extending diffusion theory beyond the light-tailed setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u5c3e\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u6570\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u7387\u53ca\u91c7\u6837\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u6269\u6563\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u8f7b\u5c3e\u76ee\u6807\u6216\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u91cd\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u8fdd\u53cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u5c3e\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u5bfc\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u7387\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u8054\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u53cd\u5411\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u91c7\u6837\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u6307\u6570\u5c3e\u65f6\u4e0e\u8f7b\u5c3e\u60c5\u51b5\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5c3e\u65f6\u901f\u7387\u4e0e\u03b3\u6709\u5173\uff1b\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u6307\u6570\u5c3e\u65f6\u4ee5\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u901f\u7387\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5c3e\u65f6\u901f\u7387\u4e0e\u03b3\u6709\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u91cd\u5c3e\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u7406\u8bba\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u8f7b\u5c3e\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e4b\u5916\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks are often constrained by pitfalls such as reliance on simulated or general-purpose samples and a focus on singular, offline static scenarios. Consequently, they fail to align with the requirements for authenticity and real-time responsiveness in financial services, leading to a significant discrepancy between benchmark performance and actual operational efficacy. To address this, we introduce BizFinBench.v2, the first large-scale evaluation benchmark grounded in authentic business data from both Chinese and U.S. equity markets, integrating online assessment. We performed clustering analysis on authentic user queries from financial platforms, resulting in eight fundamental tasks and two online tasks across four core business scenarios, totaling 29,578 expert-level Q&A pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that ChatGPT-5 achieves a prominent 61.5% accuracy in main tasks, though a substantial gap relative to financial experts persists; in online tasks, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms all other commercial LLMs. Error analysis further identifies the specific capability deficiencies of existing models within practical financial business contexts. BizFinBench.v2 transcends the limitations of current benchmarks, achieving a business-level deconstruction of LLM financial capabilities and providing a precise basis for evaluating efficacy in the widespread deployment of LLMs within the financial domain.

In this paper, we explore the causes underlying the Rashomon effect, organizing them into three categories: statistical sources arising from finite samples and noise in the data-generating process; structural sources arising from non-convexity of optimization objectives and unobserved variables that create fundamental non-identifiability; and procedural sources arising from limitations of optimization algorithms and deliberate restrictions to suboptimal model classes. We synthesize insights from machine learning, statistics, and optimization literature to provide a unified framework for understanding why the multiplicity of good models arises.

A Multi-Model Analysis of Self-Consistency Tradeoffs", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "comment": "24 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables", "summary": "Self-consistency has emerged as a popular technique for improving large language model accuracy on reasoning tasks. The approach is straightforward: generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most common answer through majority voting. While this reliably boosts accuracy, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect genuine improvements in reasoning quality. We investigate a fundamental question that has not been studied before: does inference scaling improve reasoning faithfulness?\n  We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across four frontier models (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini-3-flash-preview, and DeepSeek-v3.2) on 100 GSM8K mathematical reasoning problems. Our analysis employs bootstrap confidence intervals, McNemar's tests for paired comparisons, and Cohen's d effect sizes to quantify the effects rigorously. The results reveal striking differences across models that challenge common assumptions about self-consistency.\n  GPT-5.2 shows the expected pattern: accuracy improves from 78% to 90% at N=5, with faithfulness remaining relatively stable (0.540 to 0.510). Claude Opus 4.5 tells a completely different story. Its accuracy actually drops from 78% to 74.3% while faithfulness jumps dramatically from 0.270 to 0.891 at N=5. DeepSeek-v3.2, already at 98% accuracy, shows ceiling effects with modest faithfulness gains (0.440 to 0.541). Gemini-3-flash improves from 81% to 86% accuracy with a slight faithfulness decrease (0.260 to 0.212).\n  Problem difficulty analysis reveals that GPT-5.2 solves 82% of hard problems while breaking only 13% of easy ones. Claude, in contrast, breaks 23% of easy problems, explaining its accuracy decrease. These findings matter for practitioners: self-consistency is not universally beneficial, and teams should test their specific models before deployment.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automated code analysis, their application to security-critical malware detection faces fundamental challenges, including hallucination and context confusion, which can lead to missed detections or false alarms. We present CHASE (Collaborative Hierarchical Agents for Security Exploration), a high-reliability multi-agent architecture that addresses these limitations through a Plan-and-Execute coordination model, specialized Worker Agents focused on specific analysis aspects, and integration with deterministic security tools for critical operations. Our key insight is that reliability in LLM-based security analysis emerges not from improving individual model capabilities but from architecting systems that compensate for LLM weaknesses while leveraging their semantic understanding strengths. Evaluation on a dataset of 3,000 packages (500 malicious, 2,500 benign) demonstrates that CHASE achieves 98.4% recall with only 0.08% false positive rate, while maintaining a practical median analysis time of 4.5 minutes per package, making it suitable for operational deployment in automated package screening. Furthermore, we conducted a survey with cybersecurity professionals to evaluate the generated analysis reports, identifying their key strengths and areas for improvement.

Mobile edge computing (MEC), an emerging paradigm, effectively alleviates the load on cloud centers and improves service quality by offloading computing tasks to edge servers closer to end users. However, the limited computing resources, non-continuous power provisioning (e.g., battery-powered nodes), and highly dynamic systems of edge servers complicate efficient task scheduling and resource allocation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, TG-DCMADDPG, and constructs a collaborative computing framework for multiple edge servers, aiming to achieve joint optimization of fine-grained task partitioning and offloading. This approach incorporates a temporal graph neural network (TimeGNN) to model and predict time series of multi-dimensional server state information, thereby reducing the frequency of online interactions and improving policy predictability. Furthermore, a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DC-MADDPG) in a discrete-continuous hybrid action space is introduced to collaboratively optimize task partitioning ratios, transmission power, and priority scheduling strategies. Extensive simulation experiments confirm that TG-DCMADDPG achieves markedly faster policy convergence, superior energy-latency optimization, and higher task completion rates compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its robust scalability and practical effectiveness in dynamic and constrained MEC scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08MEC\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTG - DCMADDPG\u7b97\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u5bf9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u589e\u957f\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u538b\u529b\u589e\u5927\uff0cMEC\u867d\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u4f46\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5TG - DCMADDPG\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u79bb\u6563 - \u8fde\u7eed\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTG - DCMADDPG\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u80fd\u6e90 - \u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "TG - DCMADDPG\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u7684MEC\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure \"Artificial Entanglement\", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the \"Entanglement Valley\"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a \"no-hair\" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates.

Existing benchmarks test static knowledge, failing to capture the dynamic, application-oriented capabilities required in clinical practice.

MLB is structured around five core dimensions: Medical Knowledge (MedKQA), Safety and Ethics (MedSE), Medical Record Understanding (MedRU), Smart Services (SmartServ), and Smart Healthcare (SmartCare). The benchmark integrates 22 datasets (17 newly curated) from diverse Chinese clinical sources, covering 64 clinical specialties. Its design features a rigorous curation pipeline involving 300 licensed physicians. Besides, we provide a scalable evaluation methodology, centered on a specialized judge model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on expert annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation of 10 leading models reveals a critical translational gap: while the top-ranked model, Kimi-K2-Instruct (77.3% accuracy overall), excels in structured tasks like information extraction (87.8% accuracy in MedRU), performance plummets in patient-facing scenarios (61.3% in SmartServ). Moreover, the exceptional safety score (90.6% in MedSE) of the much smaller Baichuan-M2-32B highlights that targeted training is equally critical. Our specialized judge model, trained via SFT on a 19k expert-annotated medical dataset, achieves 92.1% accuracy, an F1-score of 94.37%, and a Cohen's Kappa of 81.3% for human-AI consistency, validating a reproducible and expert-aligned evaluation protocol.

In many domains, such as speech and biomedical signal processing, the ability to learn disentangled and interpretable representations is critical for uncovering latent generative mechanisms. Traditional approaches to unsupervised representation learning, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), often struggle to capture the temporal and spectral diversity inherent in such data. Here we introduce variational decomposition autoencoding (VDA), a framework that extends VAEs by incorporating a strong structural bias toward signal decomposition. VDA is instantiated through variational decomposition autoencoders (DecVAEs), i.e., encoder-only neural networks that combine a signal decomposition model, a contrastive self-supervised task, and variational prior approximation to learn multiple latent subspaces aligned with time-frequency characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecVAEs on simulated data and three publicly available scientific datasets, spanning speech recognition, dysarthria severity evaluation, and emotional speech classification. Our results demonstrate that DecVAEs surpass state-of-the-art VAE-based methods in terms of disentanglement quality, generalization across tasks, and the interpretability of latent encodings.

We show that a single monolithic LLM often fails to reason coherently across modalities, leading to incomplete interpretations and prior-knowledge bias. We introduce ConSensus, a training-free multi-agent collaboration framework that decomposes multimodal sensing tasks into specialized, modality-aware agents. To aggregate agent-level interpretations, we propose a hybrid fusion mechanism that balances semantic aggregation, which enables cross-modal reasoning and contextual understanding, with statistical consensus, which provides robustness through agreement across modalities.

We subject them to realistic prompt perturbations such as paraphrasing, cue inversion, and context manipulation that developers might inadvertently introduce or adversaries deliberately exploit. To enable fair comparison, we evaluate all methods under consistent conditions, jointly assessing security and functionality using multiple analyzers and executable tests. Our findings reveal critical robustness gaps: static analyzers overestimate security by 7 to 21 times, with 37 to 60% of ``secure'' outputs being non-functional.

EntroLnn treats CFT refinement as an integrated process rather than two independent tasks for pointwise SoH and EoL. We introduce entropy-based features derived from online temperature fields, applied for the first time in battery analytics, and combine them with customized LNNs that model temporal battery dynamics effectively. The framework enhances both static and dynamic adaptability of LNNs and achieves robust and generalizable CFT refinement across different batteries and operating conditions. The approach provides a high fidelity battery health model with lightweight computation, achieving mean absolute errors of only 0.004577 for CFT and 18 cycles for EoL prediction.

Although most existing research assumes utility functions to be linear in item features, this linearity assumption restricts the modeling of intricate interactions between items and user preferences. A recent work (Zhang & Luo, 2024) has investigated general utility function classes, yet its method faces fundamental trade-offs between computational tractability and statistical efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for MNL contextual bandits leveraging the upper confidence bound principle, specifically designed for non-linear parametric utility functions, including those modeled by neural networks. Under a realizability assumption and a mild geometric condition on the utility function class, our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the total number of rounds. Our result establishes that sharp $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$-regret is attainable even with neural network-based utilities, without relying on strong assumptions such as neural tangent kernel approximations. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first computationally tractable algorithm for MNL contextual bandits with non-linear utilities that provably attains $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret.

Recent evidence shows that generative AI disproportionately affects highly educated, white collar work, challenging existing assumptions about workforce vulnerability and rendering traditional approaches to digital or AI literacy insufficient. This paper introduces the concept of AI Nativity, the capacity to integrate AI fluidly into everyday reasoning, problem solving, and decision making, and proposes the AI Pyramid, a conceptual framework for organizing human capability in an AI mediated economy. The framework distinguishes three interdependent capability layers: AI Native capability as a universal baseline for participation in AI augmented environments; AI Foundation capability for building, integrating, and sustaining AI enabled systems; and AI Deep capability for advancing frontier AI knowledge and applications. Crucially, the pyramid is not a career ladder but a system level distribution of capabilities required at scale. Building on this structure, the paper argues that effective AI workforce development requires treating capability formation as infrastructure rather than episodic training, centered on problem based learning embedded in work contexts and supported by dynamic skill ontologies and competency based measurement.

The Bitcraze Crazyflie nano-drone is the \\textit{de facto} standard, offering a rich set of programmable MCUs for low-level control, multi-core processing, and radio transmission. However, roboticists very often underutilize these onboard precious resources due to the absence of a simple yet efficient software layer capable of time-optimal pipelining of multi-buffer image acquisition, multi-core computation, intra-MCUs data exchange, and Wi-Fi streaming, leading to sub-optimal control performances.

In-field experiments on three real-world TinyML nanorobotics applications show our framework achieves ideal end-to-end latency, i.e. zero overhead due to serialized tasks, delivering quantifiable improvements in closed-loop control performance ($-$30\\% mean position error, mission success rate increased from 40\\% to 100\\%).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9TinyML\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7eb3\u7c73\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faNanoCockpit\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7eb3\u7c73\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u677f\u8f7d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5c42\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNanoCockpit\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u7b80\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684TinyML\u7eb3\u7c73\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee-30%\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece40%\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230100%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "NanoCockpit\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing ICL demonstration selection methods often rely on surface-level similarity heuristics and exhibit limited robustness across tasks and models.\n  We propose MB-ICL, a manifold-based demonstration sampling framework for selecting in-context demonstrations that leverages latent representations extracted from frozen LLMs. By jointly modeling local manifold structure and class-aware prototype geometry, MB-ICL selects demonstrations based on their proximity to learned prototypes rather than lexical or embedding similarity alone.\n  Across factual verification (FEVER) and hallucination detection (HaluEval) benchmarks, MB-ICL outperforms standard ICL selection baselines in the majority of evaluated settings, with particularly strong gains on dialogue and summarization tasks. The method remains robust under temperature perturbations and model variation, indicating improved stability compared to heuristic retrieval strategies.

Traditional approaches rely on continuous optimization methods like Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) for candidate selection. However, these gradient-based methods can become trapped in local optima, particularly in complex or high-dimensional objective landscapes. This paper presents a simulated annealing-based approach for candidate optimization in batch acquisition functions as an alternative to conventional continuous optimization methods. We evaluate our simulated annealing approach against SLSQP across four benchmark multi-objective optimization problems: ZDT1 (30D, 2 objectives), DTLZ2 (7D, 3 objectives), Kursawe (3D, 2 objectives), and Latent-Aware (4D, 2 objectives). Our results demonstrate that simulated annealing consistently achieves superior hypervolume performance compared to SLSQP in most test functions. The improvement is particularly pronounced for DTLZ2 and Latent-Aware problems, where simulated annealing reaches significantly higher hypervolume values and maintains better convergence characteristics. The histogram analysis of objective space coverage further reveals that simulated annealing explores more diverse and optimal regions of the Pareto front. These findings suggest that metaheuristic optimization approaches like simulated annealing can provide more robust and effective candidate optimization for multi-objective Bayesian optimization, offering a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods for batch acquisition function optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6279\u91cf\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u5019\u9009\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4SLSQP\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u662f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5019\u9009\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u5019\u9009\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eSLSQP\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u5728\u591a\u6570\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u8d85\u4f53\u79ef\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eSLSQP\uff0c\u5728DTLZ2\u548cLatent - Aware\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u4f18\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u7b49\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose DRAGON, which stands for Decomposition and Reconstruction Agents Guided OptimizatioN, a novel framework that combines the strengths of metaheuristic design and LLM reasoning. Starting from an initial global solution, DRAGON autonomously identifies regions with high optimization potential and strategically decompose large-scale COPs into manageable subproblems. Each subproblem is then reformulated as a concise, localized optimization task and solved through targeted LLM prompting guided by accumulated experiences. Finally, the locally optimized solutions are systematically reintegrated into the original global context to yield a significantly improved overall outcome. By continuously interacting with the optimization environment and leveraging an adaptive experience memory, the agents iteratively learn from feedback, effectively coupling symbolic reasoning with heuristic search. Empirical results show that, unlike existing LLM-based solvers limited to small-scale instances, DRAGON consistently produces feasible solutions on TSPLIB, CVRPLIB, and Weibull-5k bin packing benchmarks, and achieves near-optimal results (0.16% gap) on knapsack problems with over 3M variables.

However, the complexity of developing, evaluating, and iterating on LLM-based agent workflows presents significant barriers to researchers, particularly those without extensive software engineering expertise. We present FROAV (Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification), an open-source research platform that democratizes LLM agent research by providing a plug-and-play architecture combining visual workflow orchestration, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and extensible Python integration. FROAV implements a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline coupled with a rigorous \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" evaluation system, all accessible through intuitive graphical interfaces. Our framework integrates n8n for no-code workflow design, PostgreSQL for granular data management, FastAPI for flexible backend logic, and Streamlit for human-in-the-loop interaction. Through this integrated ecosystem, researchers can rapidly prototype RAG strategies, conduct prompt engineering experiments, validate agent performance against human judgments, and collect structured feedback-all without writing infrastructure code. We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to financial document analysis, while emphasizing its material-agnostic architecture that adapts to any domain requiring semantic analysis.

Deep learning (DL) has shown promise in forecasting the effects of such mutations, but is hindered by two primary constraints. First, the structures of mutant proteins are often elusive to acquire. Secondly, PPI takes place dynamically, which is rarely integrated into the DL architecture design. To address these obstacles, we present a novel framework named Refine-PPI with two key enhancements. First, we introduce a structure refinement module trained by a mask mutation modeling (MMM) task on available wild-type structures, which is then transferred to produce the inaccessible mutant structures. Second, we employ a new kind of geometric network, called the probability density cloud network (PDC-Net), to capture 3D dynamic variations and encode the atomic uncertainty associated with PPI. Comprehensive experiments on SKEMPI.v2 substantiate the superiority of Refine-PPI over all existing tools for predicting free energy change.

Their operation relies on multiple interconnected components, and a failure in any of these can compromise the entire system's functionality. Detecting faults accurately is challenging due to the intricate, non-linear, and non-stationary nature of vibration signals, influenced by dynamic loading, environmental variations, and mechanical interactions. As such, effective signal processing techniques are essential for extracting meaningful features to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study presents a hybrid approach for fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes, combining Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN). CEEMDAN is employed to decompose vibration signals into intrinsic mode functions, isolating critical features at different time-frequency scales. These are then input into the MSCNN, which performs deep hierarchical feature extraction and classification.

While episodic settings have many theoretical results, resets are often unrealistic in practice. The infinite-horizon setting avoids this issue but lacks non-asymptotic guarantees in online scenarios with unknown dynamics. In this work, we move towards closing this gap by introducing a reset-free framework called the periodic framework, where the goal is to find periodic policies: policies that not only minimize cumulative loss but also return the agents to their initial state distribution after a fixed number of steps. We formalize the problem of finding optimal periodic policies and identify sufficient conditions under which it is well-defined for tabular Markov decision processes. To evaluate algorithms in this framework, we introduce the periodic regret, a measure that balances cumulative loss with the terminal law constraint. We then propose the first algorithms for computing periodic policies in two multi-agent settings and show they achieve sublinear periodic regret of order $\\tilde O(T^{3/4})$. This provides the first non-asymptotic guarantees for reset-free learning in the setting of $M$ homogeneous agents, for $M > 1$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u91cd\u7f6e\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u5468\u671f\u9057\u61be\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u60c5\u8282\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u91cd\u7f6e\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5e38\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u65e0\u9650\u6c34\u5e73\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9057\u61be\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86$\tilde O(T^{3/4})$\u7684\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u5468\u671f\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u540c\u8d28\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u65e0\u91cd\u7f6e\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

The dominant approach, adaptive sufficient-statistics perturbation (AdaSSP), adds an adaptively chosen perturbation to the sufficient statistics, namely, the matrix $X^{\\top}X$ and the vector $X^{\\top}Y$, and is known to achieve near-optimal accuracy and to have strong empirical performance. In contrast, methods that rely on Gaussian-sketching, which ensure differential privacy by pre-multiplying the data with a random Gaussian matrix, are widely used in federated and distributed regression, yet remain relatively uncommon for DP-OLS. In this work, we introduce the iterative Hessian mixing, a novel DP-OLS algorithm that relies on Gaussian sketches and is inspired by the iterative Hessian sketch algorithm. We provide utility analysis for the iterative Hessian mixing as well as a new analysis for the previous methods that rely on Gaussian sketches.

Existing approaches to Intent-Based Networking (IBN) rely upon either rule-based systems that struggle with linguistic variation or end-to-end neural models that lack interpretability and fail to enforce operational constraints. This paper presents a hierarchical multi-agent framework where Large Language Model (LLM) based agents autonomously decompose natural language intents, consult domain-specific specialists, and synthesise technically feasible network slice configurations through iterative reasoning-action (ReAct) cycles. The proposed architecture employs an orchestrator agent coordinating two specialist agents, i.e., Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network agents, via ReAct-style reasoning, grounded in structured network state representations. Experimental evaluation across diverse benchmark scenarios shows that the proposed system outperforms rule-based systems and direct LLM prompting, with architectural principles applicable to Open RAN (O-RAN) deployments. The results also demonstrate that whilst contemporary LLMs possess general telecommunications knowledge, network automation requires careful prompt engineering to encode context-dependent decision thresholds, advancing autonomous orchestration capabilities for next-generation wireless systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e6G\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7f51\u7edc\u8fc7\u6e21\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f16\u6392\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406 - \u884c\u52a8\u5faa\u73af\u5206\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u54a8\u8be2\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7f16\u6392\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u5219\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u901a\u7528\u7535\u4fe1\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9700\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f16\u6392\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Using a specifically designed autoencoder and jointly optimizing for both the latent representation and clustering objective, the LDTC can achieve high-quality clustering results. Moreover, unlike any previous work, the LDTC is uniquely equipped with the fully dynamic model expansion and rehearsal-based techniques to effectively learn new tasks and to tackle the dynamic data in the sequential tasks learning without the catastrophic forgetting or degradation of the model accuracy.

Existing general-purpose benchmarks provide broad coverage but lack the depth and domain fidelity needed to assess LMs' capabilities for real-world financial reasoning, which requires both conceptual understanding and quantitative rigor. To address this gap, we introduce FinForge, a scalable, semi-synthetic pipeline for constructing finance-specific evaluation benchmarks through a hybrid of expert-guided data curation and controlled LM-based synthesis. FinForge combines manual and programmatic corpus construction from authoritative financial sources with structured question generation and validation using Gemini 2.5 Flash. To demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy, we produce FinForge-5k, a snapshot benchmark comprising over 5,000 human-validated question-answer pairs across 11 finance subdomains, derived from a curated corpus of 100,000 verified documents totaling 143M tokens.

This paper presents DLNet, a practical framework with dual-stage distillation of liquid neural networks that turns a high-capacity model into compact and edge-deployable models for battery health prediction. DLNet first applies Euler discretization to reformulate liquid dynamics for embedded compatibility. It then performs dual-stage knowledge distillation to transfer the teacher model's temporal behavior and recover it after further compression. Pareto-guided selection under joint error-cost objectives retains student models that balance accuracy and efficiency. We evaluate DLNet on a widely used dataset and validate real-device feasibility on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense using int8 deployment. The final deployed student achieves a low error of 0.0066 when predicting battery health over the next 100 cycles, which is 15.4% lower than the teacher model. It reduces the model size from 616 kB to 94 kB with 84.7% reduction and takes 21 ms per inference on the device. These results support a practical smaller wins observation that a small model can match or exceed a large teacher for edge-based prognostics with proper supervision and selection.

Our approach integrates four specialized agents responsible for task understanding, topology generation, parameter configuration, and evaluation analysis, respectively, coupled with Enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search to accurately interpret semantics and robustly generate configurations. Evaluated on Simona, a large-scale process description dataset, our method achieves a 31.1% improvement in the simulation convergence rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines and reduces the design time by 89. 0% compared to the expert manual design.

However, current methods often rely on static or offline critic models, which fail to adapt as the policy evolves. In on-policy RL, the agent's error patterns shift over time, causing stationary critics to become stale and providing feedback of diminishing utility. To address this, we introduce ECHO (Evolving Critic for Hindsight-Guided Optimization)}, a framework that jointly optimizes the policy and critic through a synchronized co-evolutionary loop. ECHO utilizes a cascaded rollout mechanism where the critic generates multiple diagnoses for an initial trajectory, followed by policy refinement to enable group-structured advantage estimation. We address the challenge of learning plateaus via a saturation-aware gain shaping objective, which rewards the critic for inducing incremental improvements in high-performing trajectories. By employing dual-track GRPO updates, ECHO ensures the critic's feedback stays synchronized with the evolving policy. Experimental results show that ECHO yields more stable training and higher long-horizon task success across open-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u6279\u5224\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u968f\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u53d8\u800c\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faECHO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6279\u5224\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6216\u79bb\u7ebf\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u968f\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u53d8\u800c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u53d8\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6548\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ECHO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u6eda\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9971\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u76ca\u6574\u5f62\u76ee\u6807\u89e3\u51b3\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u53f0\u671f\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8f68GRPO\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "ECHO\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "ECHO\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6279\u5224\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

We introduce SPINAL (Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers), a diagnostic that measures how alignment reshapes representations across depth by tracing localized structural change layer by layer. Across model families, DPO produces a layerwise calibration effect concentrated in the final decoder blocks (often layers 21-30), where preference gradients most directly affect the next-token distribution. SPINAL encodes each checkpoint as a depth trace over (layer index, contraction score, transport score). The contraction score summarizes how quickly the tail of a layer's spectrum decays (how fast small modes vanish); higher values indicate stronger contraction into fewer effective directions. The transport score summarizes how much the token distribution shifts between adjacent layers using a bounded overlap measure; lower values indicate shorter, smoother steps through representation space. Aligned checkpoints show a late-layer ramp-up in contraction and a smooth reduction in transport, consistent with tightened and stabilized policy mass, while unaligned models trace higher-curvature, more entropic, and geometrically incoherent depth paths. Overall, alignment is geometrically localized: the final layers encode the dominant preference-induced corrections. SPINAL turns this localization into a practical audit signal, quantifying where alignment concentrates, how strongly it manifests, and when it begins to destabilize during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177SPINAL\u6d4b\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u8de8\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u7684\u91cd\u5851\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\uff0cSPINAL\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "DPO\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3001\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u6545\u969c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SPINAL\u9010\u5c42\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "DPO\u7684\u5c42\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u5e94\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5757\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5728\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u6536\u7f29\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u5f84\u66f2\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\uff0cSPINAL\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly the high-performance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, has emerged as a mainstream approach for this task. However, in ATP scenarios, GRPO faces two critical issues: when composite rewards are used, its relative advantage estimation may conflict with the binary feedback from the formal verifier; meanwhile, its static sampling strategy may discard entire batches of data if no valid proof is found, resulting in zero contribution to model updates and significant data waste. To address these limitations, we propose Group Dual-dynamic and Equal-right-advantage Policy Optimization (GDEPO), a method incorporating three core mechanisms: 1) dynamic additional sampling, which resamples invalid batches until a valid proof is discovered; 2) equal-right advantage, decoupling the sign of the advantage function (based on correctness) from its magnitude (modulated by auxiliary rewards) to ensure stable and correct policy updates; and 3) dynamic additional iterations, applying extra gradient steps to initially failed but eventually successful samples to accelerate learning on challenging cases. Experiments conducted on three datasets of varying difficulty (MinF2F-test, MathOlympiadBench, PutnamBench) confirm the effectiveness of GDEPO, while ablation studies validate the necessity of its synergistic components.

Taking earthquake source characterization as a representative challenge, we address limitations in conventional deep learning: CNNs demand fixed grids, while pooling-based architectures (e.g., DeepSets) struggle to capture the relational wave physics. Here, we propose SourceNet, a Transformer-based framework that treats the sensor array as a flexible set to model arbitrary geometries. To bridge the reality gap, we introduce Physics-Structured Domain Randomization (PSDR). Instead of forcing feature alignment, PSDR randomizes the governing physical dynamics by varying velocity structures, propagation effects, and sensor availability, to force the model to learn robust representations invariant to unmodeled environmental heterogeneity. By pre-training on 100,000 synthetic events and fine-tuning on ~2,000 real world events, SourceNet achieves state-of-the-art precision on held-out real data. This demonstrates exceptional data efficiency, and matches classical solvers while enabling real-time processing. Remarkably, interpretability analysis reveals that the model shows scientific-agent-like features: it autonomously discovers geometric information bottlenecks and learns an attention policy that prioritizes sparse sensor placements, effectively recovering principles of optimal experimental design from data alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684SourceNet\u6846\u67b6\u548cPSDR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u9707\u6e90\u8868\u5f81\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u5177\u6709\u79d1\u5b66\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u4e34\u65f6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9635\u5217\u63a8\u65ad\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7269\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSourceNet\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9635\u5217\u89c6\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\u96c6\u5408\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165PSDR\u65b9\u6cd5\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5408\u6210\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u771f\u5b9e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "SourceNet\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u79d1\u5b66\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u6700\u4f18\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

While reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success, it often suffers from high sample complexity, reward shaping difficulties, and produces opaque neural network policies that are hard to interpret or verify. Manual design, on the other hand, requires substantial domain expertise and struggles to scale across diverse tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary search can effectively synthesize interpretable control policies in the form of executable code. By treating policy synthesis as a code evolution problem, we harness the LLM's prior knowledge of programming patterns and control heuristics while employing evolutionary search to explore the solution space systematically. We implement our approach using EvoToolkit, a framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-driven evolution with customizable fitness evaluation. Our method iteratively evolves populations of candidate policy programs, evaluating them against task-specific objectives and selecting superior individuals for reproduction. This process yields compact, human-readable control policies that can be directly inspected, modified, and formally verified.

Here we show that large language models spontaneously develop synergistic cores -- components where information integration exceeds individual parts -- remarkably similar to those in the human brain. Using principles of information decomposition across multiple LLM model families and architectures, we find that areas in middle layers exhibit synergistic processing while early and late layers rely on redundancy, mirroring the informational organisation in biological brains. This organisation emerges through learning and is absent in randomly initialised networks. Crucially, ablating synergistic components causes disproportionate behavioural changes and performance loss, aligning with theoretical predictions about the fragility of synergy. Moreover, fine-tuning synergistic regions through reinforcement learning yields significantly greater performance gains than training redundant components, yet supervised fine-tuning shows no such advantage.

However, existing LLM-based agent training framework often focuses on answers' accuracy, overlooking specific alignment for behavior patterns. Consequently, agent often exhibits ineffective actions during TIR tasks, such as redundant and insufficient tool calls. How to calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns when executing TIR tasks, thereby exploring effective trajectories, remains an open-ended problem. In this paper, we propose ET-Agent, a training framework for calibrating agent's tool-use behavior through two synergistic perspectives: Self-evolving Data Flywheel and Behavior Calibration Training. Specifically, we introduce a self-evolutionary data flywheel to generate enhanced data, used to fine-tune LLM to improve its exploration ability. Based on this, we implement an two-phases behavior-calibration training framework. It is designed to progressively calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns to optimal behaviors. Further in-depth experiments confirm the superiority of \\ourmodel{} across multiple dimensions, including correctness, efficiency, reasoning conciseness, and tool execution accuracy. Our ET-Agent framework provides practical insights for research in the TIR field.

The anticlustering problem is NP-hard. We focus on anticlustering in Euclidean spaces, where the input data is tabular and each object is represented as a D-dimensional feature vector. Distances are measured as squared Euclidean distances between the respective vectors. Applications of Euclidean anticlustering include social studies, particularly in psychology, K-fold cross-validation in which each fold should be a good representative of the entire dataset, the creation of mini-batches for gradient descent in neural network training, and balanced K-cut partitioning. In particular, machine-learning applications involve million-scale datasets and very large values of K, making scalable anticlustering algorithms essential. Existing algorithms are either exact methods that can solve only small instances or heuristic methods, among which the most scalable is the exchange-based heuristic fast_anticlustering. We propose a new algorithm, the Assignment-Based Anticlustering algorithm (ABA), which scales to very large instances. A computational study shows that ABA outperforms fast_anticlustering in both solution quality and running time. Moreover, ABA scales to instances with millions of objects and hundreds of thousands of anticlusters within short running times, beyond what fast_anticlustering can handle. As a balanced K-cut partitioning method for tabular data, ABA is superior to the well-known METIS method in both solution quality and running time.

While large language models show considerable promise for mental health support, their predominantly Western-centric training data limit cultural and linguistic applicability in African contexts. This study introduces a proof-of-concept framework that integrates cognitive behavioral therapy with the African philosophy of Ubuntu to create a culturally sensitive, emotionally intelligent, AI-driven mental health dialogue system. Guided by a design science research methodology, the framework applies both deep theoretical and therapeutic adaptations as well as surface-level linguistic and communicative cultural adaptations. Key CBT techniques, including behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring, were reinterpreted through Ubuntu principles that emphasize communal well-being, spiritual grounding, and interconnectedness. A culturally adapted dataset was developed through iterative processes of language simplification, spiritual contextualization, and Ubuntu-based reframing. The fine-tuned model was evaluated through expert-informed case studies, employing UniEval for conversational quality assessment alongside additional measures of CBT reliability and cultural linguistic alignment. Results demonstrate that the model effectively engages in empathetic, context-aware dialogue aligned with both therapeutic and cultural objectives. Although real-time end-user testing has not yet been conducted, the model underwent rigorous review and supervision by domain specialist clinical psychologists.

This undermines the core goal of parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We propose Monkey Jump, a method that brings mixture-of-experts-style specialization to parameter-efficient fine-tuning without introducing extra trainable parameters for experts or routers. Instead of adding new adapters as experts, Monkey Jump treats the adapters already present in each Transformer block (such as query, key, value, up, and down projections) as implicit experts and routes tokens among them. Routing is performed using k-means clustering with exponentially moving averaged cluster centers, requiring no gradients and no learned parameters. We theoretically show that token-wise routing increases expressivity and can outperform shared adapters by avoiding cancellation effects.

Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression, neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues: (1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the desired area, and (2) uniform modeling the target UI element fails to distinguish between its center and edges, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size. Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by V2P achieves the performance with 92.4\\% and 52.5\\% on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:main_results_charts}).

We combine gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with a precomputed STRING protein-protein interaction network to classify tissue origin and distinguish between normal and tumor samples. The model employs Chebyshev graph convolutions (K=2) and weighted pooling layers, aggregating gene clusters into 'supernodes' across multiple coarsening levels. This approach enables dimensionality reduction while preserving meaningful interactions. Saliency methods were applied to interpret the model by identifying key genes and biological processes relevant to cancer. Our findings reveal that increasing the number of convolution and pooling layers did not enhance classification performance. The highest F1-macro score (0.978) was achieved with a single pooling layer. However, adding more layers resulted in over-smoothing and performance degradation. However, the model proved highly interpretable through gradient methods, identifying known cancer-related genes and highlighting enriched biological processes, and its hierarchical structure can be used to develop new explainable architectures.

In real scenarios such as personalized recommendation and cross-device user profiling, the global cluster may be fragmented and distributed among different clients, and the clusters may exist at different granularities or even nested. Although Hierarchical Clustering (HC) is considered promising for exploring such distributions, the sophisticated recursive clustering process makes it more computationally expensive and vulnerable to privacy exposure, thus relatively unexplored under the federated learning scenario. This paper introduces an efficient one-shot hierarchical FC framework that performs client-end distribution exploration and server-end distribution aggregation through one-way prototype-level communication from clients to the server. A fine partition mechanism is developed to generate successive clusterlets to describe the complex landscape of the clients' clusters.

We demonstrate that our method enables cost-aware selective classification in real-world human-AI workflows: escalating high-risk cases while automating the rest. Experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, including both off-the-shelf (Gemini, GPT) and open-source (Llama, Qwen), on multimodal and multilingual moderation tasks, show significant improvements over existing uncertainty estimators in accuracy-cost trade-offs.

However, this parallel sampling approach, especially when using fewer inference steps, will introduce strong dependency errors and cause quality to deteriorate rapidly as the generation step size grows. As a result, reliable self-correction becomes essential for maintaining high-quality multi-token generation. To address this, we propose Decoupled Self-Correction (DSC), a novel two-stage methodology. DSC first fully optimizes the DLM's generative ability before freezing the model and training a specialized correction head. This decoupling preserves the model's peak SFT performance and ensures the generated errors used for correction head training are of higher quality. Additionally, we introduce Future-Context Augmentation (FCA) to maximize the correction head's accuracy. FCA generalizes the error training distribution by augmenting samples with ground-truth tokens, effectively training the head to utilize a richer, future-looking context. This mechanism is used for reliably detecting the subtle errors of the high-fidelity base model. Our DSC framework enables the model, at inference time, to jointly generate and revise tokens, thereby correcting errors introduced by multi-token generation and mitigating error accumulation across steps.

This approach allows large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate and solve complex problems, thereby improving their reasoning capabilities.

In this work, we introduce Dr. Zero, a framework enabling search agents to effectively self-evolve without any training data. In particular, we design a self-evolution feedback loop where a proposer generates diverse questions to train a solver initialized from the same base model. As the solver evolves, it incentivizes the proposer to produce increasingly difficult yet solvable tasks, thus establishing an automated curriculum to refine both agents. To enhance training efficiency, we also introduce hop-grouped relative policy optimization (HRPO). This method clusters structurally similar questions to construct group-level baselines, effectively minimizing the sampling overhead in evaluating each query's individual difficulty and solvability.

The findings indicate that the proposed method can effectively generate educational questions and discern hierarchical relationships among them, leading to structured question maps that facilitate personalized and adaptive learning in downstream applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u9886\u57df\u95ee\u9898\u56fe\uff08DQMs\uff09\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6559\u80b2\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u56e0\u6559\u80b2\u5185\u5bb9\u590d\u6742\u591a\u53d8\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7ea7\u6559\u5b66\u76ee\u7684\u7684\u5b66\u79d1\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6784\u5efa\u9886\u57df\u95ee\u9898\u56fe\uff08DQMs\uff09\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5236\u5b9a\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u6559\u80b2\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

This leads to substantial computational overhead with limited performance gain, primarily due to redundant verification and repetitive generation. While prior work typically constrains output length or optimizes correctness, such coarse supervision fails to guide models toward concise yet accurate inference. In this paper, we propose ENTRA, an entropy-based training framework that suppresses redundant reasoning while preserving performance. ENTRA first estimates the token-level importance using a lightweight Bidirectional Importance Estimation (BIE) method, which accounts for both prediction confidence and forward influence. It then computes a redundancy reward based on the entropy of low-importance tokens, normalized by its theoretical upper bound, and optimizes this reward via reinforcement learning. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ENTRA reduces output length by 37% to 53% with no loss-and in some cases, gains-in accuracy.

These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints.

In a controlled pretraining comparison with Llama2 and Megalodon in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens, Gecko achieves better efficiency and long-context scalability. Gecko reaches a training loss of 1.68, significantly outperforming Llama2-7B (1.75) and Megalodon-7B (1.70), and landing close to Llama2-13B (1.67). Notably, without relying on any context-extension techniques, Gecko exhibits inherent long-context processing and retrieval capabilities, stably handling sequences of up to 4 million tokens and retrieving information from contexts up to $4\\times$ longer than its attention window.

However, unlocking their full potential requires developing high-performance compute kernels using vendor-specific Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), a task that demands deep hardware expertise and is labor-intensive. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general code generation, they struggle with the strict constraints and scarcity of training data in the NPU domain. Our preliminary study reveals that state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs fail to generate functional complex kernels for Ascend NPUs, yielding a near-zero success rate. To address these challenges, we propose AscendKernelGen, a generation-evaluation integrated framework for NPU kernel development. We introduce Ascend-CoT, a high-quality dataset incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning derived from real-world kernel implementations, and KernelGen-LM, a domain-adaptive model trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with execution feedback. Furthermore, we design NPUKernelBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing compilation, correctness, and performance across varying complexity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bridges the gap between general LLMs and hardware-specific coding. Specifically, the compilation success rate on complex Level-2 kernels improves from 0% to 95.5% (Pass@10), while functional correctness achieves 64.3% compared to the baseline's complete failure.

We introduce LLMRouterBench, a large-scale benchmark and unified framework for LLM routing. It comprises over 400K instances from 21 datasets and 33 models. Moreover, it provides comprehensive metrics for both performance-oriented routing and performance-cost trade-off routing, and integrates 10 representative routing baselines. Using LLMRouterBench, we systematically re-evaluate the field. While confirming strong model complementarity-the central premise of LLM routing-we find that many routing methods exhibit similar performance under unified evaluation, and several recent approaches, including commercial routers, fail to reliably outperform a simple baseline. Meanwhile, a substantial gap remains to the Oracle, driven primarily by persistent model-recall failures. We further show that backbone embedding models have limited impact, that larger ensembles exhibit diminishing returns compared to careful model curation, and that the benchmark also enables latency-aware analysis.

Due to the absence of objective ground-truth for these tasks, current RL algorithms largely rely on reward models that assign scalar scores to individual responses. We contend that such pointwise scoring suffers from an inherent discrimination collapse: the reward model struggles to distinguish subtle advantages among different trajectories, resulting in scores within a group being compressed into a narrow range. Consequently, the effective reward signal becomes dominated by noise from the reward model, leading to optimization stagnation. To address this, we propose ArenaRL, a reinforcement learning paradigm that shifts from pointwise scalar scoring to intra-group relative ranking. ArenaRL introduces a process-aware pairwise evaluation mechanism, employing multi-level rubrics to assign fine-grained relative scores to trajectories. Additionally, we construct an intra-group adversarial arena and devise a tournament-based ranking scheme to obtain stable advantage signals. Empirical results confirm that the built seeded single-elimination scheme achieves nearly equivalent advantage estimation accuracy to full pairwise comparisons with O(N^2) complexity, while operating with only O(N) complexity, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and precision. Furthermore, to address the lack of full-cycle benchmarks for open-ended agents, we build Open-Travel and Open-DeepResearch, two high-quality benchmarks featuring a comprehensive pipeline covering SFT, RL training, and multi-dimensional evaluation.

Since SFT targets pattern consolidation through imitation while RL drives structural adaptation via exploration, misaligning data with these functional roles causes severe optimization interference. We propose PRISM, a dynamics-aware framework grounded in Schema Theory that arbitrates data based on its degree of cognitive conflict with the model's existing knowledge. By analyzing the spatial geometric structure of gradients, PRISM identifies data triggering high spatial concentration as high-conflict signals that require RL for structural restructuring. In contrast, data yielding diffuse updates is routed to SFT for efficient consolidation. Extensive experiments on WebShop and ALFWorld demonstrate that PRISM achieves a Pareto improvement, outperforming state-of-the-art hybrid methods while reducing computational costs by up to 3.22$\\times$.

We introduce LookaHES, a nonmyopic BO framework designed for dynamic, history-dependent cost environments, where evaluation costs vary with prior actions, such as travel distance in spatial tasks or edit distance in sequence design. LookaHES combines a multi-step variant of $H$-Entropy Search with pathwise sampling and neural policy optimization, enabling long-horizon planning beyond twenty steps without the exponential complexity of existing nonmyopic methods. The key innovation is the integration of neural policies, including large language models, to effectively navigate structured, combinatorial action spaces such as protein sequences. These policies amortize lookahead planning and can be integrated with domain-specific constraints during rollout. Empirically, LookaHES outperforms strong myopic and nonmyopic baselines across nine synthetic benchmarks from two to eight dimensions and two real-world tasks: geospatial optimization using NASA night-light imagery and protein sequence design with constrained token-level edits.

However, this shift introduces input contexts that are inherently noisy, a reality that current sanitized benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce NoisyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates model robustness across 11 datasets in RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks against diverse noise types, including random documents, irrelevant chat histories, and hard negative distractors. Our evaluation reveals a catastrophic performance drop of up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Crucially, we find that agentic workflows often amplify these errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs, and distractors can trigger emergent misalignment even without adversarial intent. We find that prompting, context engineering, SFT, and outcome-reward only RL fail to ensure robustness; in contrast, our proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) significantly strengthens resilience by incentivizing the identification of helpful information within noise. Finally, we uncover an inverse scaling trend where increased test-time computation leads to worse performance in noisy settings and demonstrate via attention visualization that models disproportionately focus on distractor tokens, providing vital insights for building the next generation of robust, reasoning-capable agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165NoisyBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRARE\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u6837\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u51c0\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u8003\u8651\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165NoisyBench\uff0c\u5bf911\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u591a\u4e0b\u964d80%\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cRARE\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u97e7\u6027\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u53cd\u5411\u7f29\u653e\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u5e72\u6270\u8bcd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

In that sense, novel methods for workpiece inspection, suitable, for smart manufacturing are needed. Programmable Wireless Environments (PWE) could help towards that direction, by redefining the wireless Radio Frequency (RF) wave propagation as a controllable inspector entity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Non-Destructive Inspection, leveraging an RF sensing pipeline based on RF wavefront encoding for retrieving workpiece-image entries from a designated database. This approach combines PWE-enabled RF wave manipulation with machine learning (ML) tools trained to produce visual outputs for quality inspection. Specifically, we establish correlation relationships between RF wavefronts and target industrial assets, hence yielding a dataset which links wavefronts to their corresponding images in a structured manner.

We propose FLoReNce, an agentic feedback reasoning framework that treats meme understanding as a closed-loop process during learning and an open-loop process during inference. In the closed loop, a reasoning agent is critiqued by a judge; the error and semantic feedback are converted into control signals and stored in a feedback-informed, non-parametric knowledge base. At inference, the model retrieves similar judged experiences from this KB and uses them to modulate its prompt, enabling better, self-aligned reasoning without finetuning.

Leveraging multiple interrelated time series, CIF prediction is typically formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem. Despite advances in deep learning-based methods, it remains challenging to capture the fine-grained local-temporal dependencies, dynamic higher-order cross-variable dependencies, and complex multi-frequency patterns for CIF forecasting. To address these issues, we propose a novel model that integrates two parallel modules: 1) one enhances the extraction of local-temporal dependencies under multi-frequency by applying multiple wavelet-based convolutional kernels to overlapping patches of varying lengths; 2) the other captures dynamic cross-variable dependencies under multi-frequency to model how inter-variable relationships evolve across the time-frequency domain. Evaluations on four representative electricity markets from Australia, featuring varying levels of renewable penetration, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. An ablation study further validates the complementary benefits of the two proposed modules.

However, their application to Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting (STELF) -- a typical scenario in energy systems -- remains largely unexplored. Considering the nonlinear and fluctuating characteristics of the load data, effectively utilizing the powerful modeling capabilities of diffusion models to enhance STELF accuracy remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel diffusion model with multi-frequency reconstruction for STELF, referred to as the Multi-Frequency-Reconstruction-based Diffusion (MFRD) model. The MFRD model achieves accurate load forecasting through four key steps: (1) The original data is combined with the decomposed multi-frequency modes to form a new data representation; (2) The diffusion model adds noise to the new data, effectively reducing and weakening the noise in the original data; (3) The reverse process adopts a denoising network that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer to enhance noise removal; and (4) The inference process generates the final predictions based on the trained denoising network.

Through a systematic analysis, we identify substantial accuracy variance across these patterns on mathematics and science benchmarks, revealing that a model's default reasoning pattern is often sub-optimal for a given problem. To address this, we introduce Group Pattern Selection Optimization (GPSO), a reinforcement learning framework that extends GRPO by incorporating multi-pattern rollouts, verifier-guided optimal pattern selection per problem, and attention masking during optimization to prevent the leakage of explicit pattern suffixes into the learned policy. By exploring a portfolio of diverse reasoning strategies and optimizing the policy on the most effective ones, GPSO enables the model to internalize the mapping from problem characteristics to optimal reasoning patterns.

While these capabilities are particularly advantageous for long-context generation, deploying such models faces a prohibitive memory capacity barrier stemming from severe system inefficiencies. We identify that existing inference systems are ill-suited for this paradigm: unlike autoregressive models constrained by the cumulative KV-cache, dLLMs are bottlenecked by transient activations recomputed at every step. Furthermore, general-purpose memory reuse mechanisms lack the global visibility to adapt to dLLMs' dynamic memory peaks, which toggle between logits and FFNs. To address these mismatches, we propose Mosaic, a memory-efficient inference system that shifts from local, static management to a global, dynamic paradigm. Mosaic integrates a mask-only logits kernel to eliminate redundancy, a lazy chunking optimizer driven by an online heuristic search to adaptively mitigate dynamic peaks, and a global memory manager to resolve fragmentation via virtual addressing. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Mosaic achieves an average 2.71$\\times$ reduction in the memory peak-to-average ratio and increases the maximum inference sequence length supportable on identical hardware by 15.89-32.98$\\times$.

As large language models move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented a detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can enforce bitwise-identical outputs, positioning deterministic inference as a prerequisite for reproducibility and enterprise reliability.\n  In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills. It kills the ability to model uncertainty, suppresses emergent abilities, collapses reasoning into a single brittle path, and weakens safety alignment by hiding tail risks. LLMs implement conditional distributions over outputs, not fixed functions. Collapsing these distributions to a single canonical completion may appear reassuring, but it systematically conceals properties central to artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOS, treating distributional variability as a signal to be measured and controlled.\n  Empirically, we show that deterministic inference is systematically misleading. Single-sample deterministic evaluation underestimates both capability and fragility, masking failure probability under paraphrases and noise. Phase-like transitions associated with emergent abilities disappear under greedy decoding. Multi-path reasoning degrades when forced onto deterministic backbones, reducing accuracy and diagnostic insight. Finally, deterministic evaluation underestimates safety risk by hiding rare but dangerous behaviors that appear only under multi-sample evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53cd\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u6709\u8bf8\u591a\u5f0a\u7aef\uff0c\u63d0\u5021\u968f\u673aCHAOS\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u5177\u6709\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6307\u51fa\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7406\u5ff5\u5f15\u5165LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5806\u6808\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f0a\u7aef\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9LLM\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u4f1a\u4f4e\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3001\u4f7f\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u6d88\u5931\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u3001\u4f4e\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4e0d\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e94\u5c06\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5021Stochastic CHAOS\u3002"}}

We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource- constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hal- lucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing com- plementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5171\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5c42\u9762\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u8106\u5f31\u6545\u969c\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u4f73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u8bc6\u4ee5\u5224\u65ad\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u7b49\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u54cd\u5e94\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6811\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0cBrier\u5206\u6570\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u8bc6\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5355\u673a\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4e5f\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches to root cause analysis(RCA) rely on hard-coded graph traversal algorithms or rule-based correlation engines, which are costly to maintain and tightly coupled to the infrastructure model.\n  In this work, we introduce an agentic diagnostic framework where a Large Language Model (LLM) performs step-wise investigation using a constrained tool space exposed through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of embedding causal logic or traversal algorithms into the application, the agent autonomously navigates the infrastructure model by invoking tools for service lookup, dependency retrieval, structured and unstructured data, and event analysis, and impact discovery. We define an investigation protocol that structures the agent's reasoning and ensures grounding, reproducibility, and safe handling of missing or ambiguous information.\n  This work lays the foundation for autonomous incident resolution and change impact mitigation.

In this work, we present KASER (Knowledge-Aligned Student Error Simulator), a novel approach that aligns errors with student knowledge. We propose a training method based on reinforcement learning using a hybrid reward that reflects three aspects of student code prediction: i) code similarity to the ground-truth, ii) error matching, and iii) code prediction diversity.

With the rapid development of AI technology in recent years, how to compare and evaluate human and AI intelligence has become an important theoretical issue. However, existing definitions of intelligence are anthropocentric and unsuitable for empirical comparison, resulting in a lack of consensus in the research field.\n  This paper first introduces four criteria for evaluating intelligence definitions based on R. Carnap's methodology of conceptual clarification: similarity to explicandum, exactness, fruitfulness, and simplicity. We then examine six representative definitions: IQ testing, complex problem-solving ability, reward optimization, environmental adaptation, learning efficiency, and predictive ability, and clarify their theoretical strengths and limitations.\n  The results show that while definitions based on predictive ability have high explanatory power and empirical feasibility, they suffer from an inability to adequately explain the relationship between predictions and behavior/benefits. This paper proposes the Extended Predictive Hypothesis (EPH), which views intelligence as a combination of the ability to accurately predict the future and the ability to benefit from those predictions. Furthermore, by distinguishing predictive ability into spontaneous and reactive predictions and adding the concept of gainability, we present a unified framework for explaining various aspects of intelligence, such as creativity, learning, and future planning.

While defenses against membership inference attacks in standard FL have been well studied, the recent shift toward federated fine-tuning has introduced new, largely unexplored attack surfaces. To highlight this vulnerability in the emerging FL paradigm, we demonstrate that federated prompt-tuning, which adapts pre-trained models with small input prefixes to improve efficiency, also exposes a new vector for privacy attacks. We propose PromptMIA, a membership inference attack tailored to federated prompt-tuning, in which a malicious server can insert adversarially crafted prompts and monitors their updates during collaborative training to accurately determine whether a target data point is in a client's private dataset. We formalize this threat as a security game and empirically show that PromptMIA consistently attains high advantage in this game across diverse benchmark datasets. Our theoretical analysis further establishes a lower bound on the attack's advantage which explains and supports the consistently high advantage observed in our empirical results. We also investigate the effectiveness of standard membership inference defenses originally developed for gradient or output based attacks and analyze their interaction with the distinct threat landscape posed by PromptMIA.

Building on prior work introducing an energy-aware parameter efficiency metric, this study empirically examines the effects of increasing training token counts under fixed hardware and training conditions. The significance of this work lies in the explicit integration of power consumption and execution duration, as reflected by the power sampling frequency, into token-scale analysis. This addresses a gap in prior studies emphasizing performance outcomes while underrepresenting computational and energy costs. Using a repeated-measures experimental design on a constant GPU instance with an identical model architecture, optimizer settings, and epoch counts, a 1.1-billion-parameter TinyLlama model was trained at three token counts (500K, 1M, and 2M). While conventional performance metrics exhibited inconsistent or diminishing returns across token scales, the inclusion of power consumption and execution duration revealed a strictly monotonic decline in training efficiency as token count increased. Repeated-measures ANOVA demonstrated a strong effect of token count on parameter efficiency, with all pairwise comparisons remaining significant following Bonferroni correction. These findings indicate that increases in training token counts may be energetically inefficient even when marginal performance improvements are observed, underscoring the importance of efficiency-aware evaluation in large language model training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u589e\u52a0\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8003\u8651\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u7591\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u80fd\u5426\u5e26\u6765\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u89c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u6b64\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u6052\u5b9aGPU\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u76f8\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u8f6e\u6570\uff0c\u5bf911\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684TinyLlama\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee4\u724c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u56de\u62a5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u9012\u51cf\uff0c\u7eb3\u5165\u529f\u8017\u548c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u540e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u968f\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u4e25\u683c\u5355\u8c03\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u8fb9\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, existing studies mainly focus on accuracy improvement, while critical system-level factors such as inference latency and energy consumption are often overlooked, resulting in increasingly complex model designs that hinder practical deployment. Prior efforts on model compression and acceleration typically optimize either the software or hardware side in isolation. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally remove intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads, whereas hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and precision. As a result, the real-world benefits of such optimizations are often limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a reusable software and hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework jointly integrates software-level model optimization with hardware-level computation optimization under a unified system-level objective. In addition, a multidimensional evaluation metric is introduced to assess system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy, enabling quantitative comparison of different optimization strategies. Experiments across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks show that the proposed framework preserves baseline-level driving performance while significantly reducing inference latency and energy consumption, achieving substantial overall system-level improvements.

Although data-driven graph-learning models have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of evacuation traffic at a network level, they mostly consider a single dimension (e.g., travel-time or distance) to construct the underlying graph. Furthermore, these models often lack interpretability, offering little insight into which input variables contribute most to their predictive performance. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning-guided Dynamic Multi-Graph Fusion (RL-DMF) framework for evacuation traffic prediction. We construct multiple dynamic graphs at each time step to represent heterogeneous spatiotemporal relationships between traffic detectors. A dynamic multi-graph fusion (DMF) module is employed to adaptively learn and combine information from these graphs. To enhance model interpretability, we introduce RL-based intelligent feature selection and ranking (RL-IFSR) method that learns to mask irrelevant features during model training. The model is evaluated using a real-world dataset of 12 hurricanes affecting Florida from 2016 to 2024. For an unseen hurricane (Milton, 2024), the model achieves a 95% accuracy (RMSE = 293.9) for predicting the next 1-hour traffic flow. Moreover, the model can forecast traffic flow for up to next 6 hours with 90% accuracy (RMSE = 426.4). The RL-DMF framework outperforms several state-of-the-art traffic prediction models. Furthermore, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of dynamic multi-graph fusion and RL-IFSR approaches for improving model performance.

Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.

However, this plasticity is not universal: while instruction-tuned models utilized the budget to elongate their chain-of-thought and maximize reward, heavily math-aligned models suffered performance collapse, suggesting that noisy, low-budget RL updates can act as destructive interference for models already residing near a task-specific optimum.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u22641.5B\uff09\u80fd\u5426\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5355\u5f20A40 GPU\uff0848GB\uff09\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u523024\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLVR\uff09\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u5728AIME 24\u4e0aPass@1\u8fbe\u523040.0%\uff08\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u534711.1%\uff09\uff0cPass@16\u8fbe\u523070.0%\uff1b\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6570\u5b66\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u201c\u5fae\u9884\u7b97\u201d\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6210\u529f\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u4f4e\u9884\u7b97RL\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u63a5\u8fd1\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u7834\u574f\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can enhance LLM reasoning abilities to some extent, they often suffer from a lack of faithfulness, where the derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches to bolster LLM logical reasoning capabilities. However, existing neuro-symbolic methods still face challenges with information loss during the process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS), a novel prompt-based method that employs a multi-round feedback mechanism to address LLM limitations in handling complex logical relationships. IFDNS utilizes iterative feedback during the logic extraction phase to accurately extract causal relationship statements and translate them into propositional and logical implication expressions, effectively mitigating information loss issues. Furthermore, IFDNS is orthogonal to existing prompt methods, allowing for seamless integration with various prompting approaches. Empirical evaluations across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IFDNS in significantly improving the performance of CoT and Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC).

We introduce ExCIR (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a theoretically grounded, simple, and reliable metric for explaining the contribution of input features to model outputs, which remains stable and consistent under noise and sampling variations. We demonstrate that ExCIR captures dependencies arising from correlated features through a lightweight single pass formulation. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets, including EEG, synthetic vehicular data, Digits, and Cats-Dogs, validate the effectiveness and stability of ExCIR across domains, achieving more interpretable feature explanations than existing methods while remaining computationally efficient.

To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation.

Instead of just showing high test performance, our approach trains and tests on spurious labels carefully permuted based on a potential outcomes framework. A truly trustworthy model should fail under such label permutation; comparable accuracy across real and permuted labels indicates overfitting, shortcut learning, or data leakage. Our approach quantifies this behavior through interpretable Fisher-style p-values, which are well understood by domain experts across medical and life sciences.

While prior studies have explored this area, the potential of dynamic data features and multi category entities has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a framework that integrates heterogeneous graph deep learning models to enhance early and continuous student performance prediction, using traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison. Our approach employs a graph metapath structure and incorporates dynamic assessment features, which progressively influence the student success prediction task. Experiments on the Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset demonstrate promising results, achieving a 68.6% validation F1 score with only 7% of the semester completed, and reaching up to 89.5% near the semester's end.

However, most existing approaches store memory in fixed representations and reuse it at a single or implicit level of abstraction, which limits generalization and often leads to negative transfer when distribution shift. This paper proposes the Meta-Cognitive Memory Abstraction method (MCMA), which treats memory abstraction as a learnable cognitive skill rather than a fixed design choice. MCMA decouples task execution from memory management by combining a frozen task model with a learned memory copilot. The memory copilot is trained using direct preference optimization, it determines how memories should be structured, abstracted, and reused. Memories are further organized into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, enabling selective reuse based on task similarity. When no memory is transferable, MCMA transfers the ability to abstract and manage memory by transferring the memory copilot.

Current methods rely on coarse, end-to-end evaluation signals and lack fine-grained signals on where to refine, often resulting in inefficient or low-impact modifications. To address these limitations, we propose {\\our{}}, an Evaluation-Judge-Optimization-Update pipeline. We incorporate reusable, configurable logic blocks into agentic workflows to capture fundamental forms of logic. On top of this abstraction, we design a dedicated Judge module that inspects execution traces -- particularly failed runs -- and assigns rank-based responsibility scores to problematic blocks. These fine-grained diagnostic signals are then leveraged by an LLM-based optimizer, which focuses modifications on the most problematic block in the workflow.

In practice, hospitals experience continual evolution in case mix, annotation protocols, and imaging devices, which leads to catastrophic forgetting when models are updated sequentially. Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to reconcile these challenges but existing methods either ignore the stringent privacy constraints of healthcare or rely on replay buffers and public surrogate datasets that are difficult to justify in clinical settings. We study FCL for chest radiography classification in a setting where hospitals are clients that receive temporally evolving streams of cases and labels. We introduce DP-FedEPC (Differentially Private Federated Elastic Prototype Consolidation), a method that combines elastic weight consolidation (EWC), prototype-based rehearsal, and client-side differential privacy within a standard FedAvg framework.

While the general prediction of such motion for an arbitrary control mechanism is difficult, for a particular choice of control, the dynamics reduces to the Lie-Poisson equations [33,34]. Our goal is to learn the phase-space dynamics and predict the motion solely from observations, without any knowledge of the control Hamiltonian or the nature of interaction between vehicles. To achieve that goal, we propose the Control Optimal Lie-Poisson Neural Networks (CO-LPNets) for learning and predicting the dynamics of the system from data. Our methods learn the mapping of the phase space through the composition of Poisson maps, which are obtained as flows from Hamiltonians that could be integrated explicitly. CO-LPNets preserve the Poisson bracket and thus preserve Casimirs to machine precision. We discuss the completeness of the derived neural networks and their efficiency in approximating the dynamics. To illustrate the power of the method, we apply these techniques to systems of $N=3$ particles evolving on ${\\rm SO}(3)$ group, which describe coupled rigid bodies rotating about their center of mass, and ${\\rm SE}(3)$ group, applicable to the movement of unmanned air and water vehicles. Numerical results demonstrate that CO-LPNets learn the dynamics in phase space from data points and reproduce trajectories, with good accuracy, over hundreds of time steps.

Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTDP\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u8026\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u4e14\u4f7f\u5c40\u90e8\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u9760\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684TDP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Supervisor\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528Planner\u548cExecutor\u9650\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728TravelPlanner\u3001ScienceWorld\u548cHotpotQA\u4e0a\uff0cTDP\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1182%\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u8026\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Many multi-agent systems simulate human roles at a surface level, missing the underlying criteria that lead experts to assess complementary intellectual aspects of a paper. Moreover, prior methods implicitly assume identified weaknesses are valid, ignoring reviewer bias, misunderstanding, and the critical role of author rebuttals in validating review quality. Finally, most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise.

ECG signals, which are feasible on wearable equipment pieces such as headbands, present a promising method for cognitive state monitoring. This research explores whether electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are able to indicate mental workload consistently and act as surrogates for EEG-based cognitive indicators. This study investigates whether ECG-derived features can serve as surrogate indicators of cognitive load, a concept traditionally quantified using EEG. Using a publicly available multimodal dataset (OpenNeuro) of EEG and ECG recorded during working-memory and listening tasks, features of HRV and Catch22 descriptors are extracted from ECG, and spectral band-power with Catch22 features from EEG. A cross-modal regression framework based on XGBoost was trained to map ECG-derived HRV representations to EEG-derived cognitive features. In order to address data sparsity and model brain-heart interactions, we integrated the PSV-SDG to produce EEG-conditioned synthetic HRV time series.This addresses the challenge of inferring cognitive load solely from ECG-derived features using a combination of multimodal learning, signal processing, and synthetic data generation. These outcomes form a basis for light, interpretable machine learning models that are implemented through wearable biosensors in non-lab environments. Synthetic HRV inclusion enhances robustness, particularly in sparse data situations. Overall, this work is an initiation for building low-cost, explainable, and real-time cognitive monitoring systems for mental health, education, and human-computer interaction, with a focus on ageing and clinical populations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\uff08ECG\uff09\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u5426\u66ff\u4ee3\u8111\u7535\u56fe\uff08EEG\uff09\u6307\u793a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u3001XGBoost\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u57fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u8111\u7535\u56fe\uff08EEG\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u5fc3\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u975e\u4fbf\u643a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\uff08ECG\uff09\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u5426\u7a33\u5b9a\u6307\u793a\u5fc3\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\u5e76\u66ff\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8eEEG\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4eceECG\u63d0\u53d6HRV\u548cCatch22\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4eceEEG\u63d0\u53d6\u8c31\u5e26\u529f\u7387\u548cCatch22\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eXGBoost\u8bad\u7ec3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210PSV - SDG\u751f\u6210EEG\u6761\u4ef6\u5408\u6210HRV\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u751f\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5408\u6210HRV\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u9886\u57df\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u521b\u5148\u6cb3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u8001\u5e74\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4eba\u7fa4\u3002"}}

This extension enables evaluation of models that jointly reason over tabular evidence and contextual semantics, an increasingly critical capability for foundation models on structured data. Empirical analysis reveals that while metadata-derived features yield modest improvements in classical prediction metrics, these metadata features consistently highlight gaps in the ability of models to leverage semantics in relational context.

As a result, many approaches have been designed to detect it, and lately Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated as a competent candidate. However, when trained with a large amount of data, they are slow and computationally demanding. In addition, GNNs may need a deep architecture to detect complex fraud patterns, but doing so may make them suffer from problems such as over-fitting or over-smoothing. Over-fitting leads to reduced generalisation of the model on unseen data, while over-smoothing causes all nodes' features to converge to a fixed point due to excessive aggregation of information from neighbouring nodes. In this research, I propose an approach called One-Side Edge Sampling (OES) that can potentially reduce training duration as well as the effects of over-smoothing and over-fitting. The approach leverages predictive confidence in an edge classification task to sample edges from the input graph during a certain number of epochs. To explain why OES can alleviate over-smoothing, I perform a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach. In addition, to validate the effect of OES, I conduct experiments using different GNNs on two datasets.

Existing LLM-based agents rely on static, pre-defined tool libraries, a paradigm that fundamentally fails in scientific domains where tools are sparse, heterogeneous, and intrinsically incomplete. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE), a new paradigm that enables agents to synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference. By transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts, TTE overcomes the rigidity and long-tail limitations of static tool libraries.

Existing WFR solvers, however, are often unstable, computationally expensive, and difficult to scale. Here we introduce WFR Flow Matching (WFR-FM), a simulation-free training algorithm that unifies flow matching with dynamic unbalanced OT. Unlike classical flow matching which regresses only a transport vector field, WFR-FM simultaneously regresses a vector field for displacement and a scalar growth rate function for birth-death dynamics, yielding continuous flows under the WFR geometry. Theoretically, we show that minimizing the WFR-FM loss exactly recovers WFR geodesics. Empirically, WFR-FM yields more accurate and robust trajectory inference in single-cell biology, reconstructing consistent dynamics with proliferation and apoptosis, estimating time-varying growth fields, and applying to generative dynamics under imbalanced data. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in efficiency, stability, and reconstruction accuracy.

In contrast, affordable hardware is low-cost but constrained by memory capacity and bandwidth, making it unsuitable for direct LLM training. To address this, we propose MoE-DisCo (Mixture-of-Experts with Disentangled Clustering and Coordination), a staged training framework. MoE-DisCo decomposes the MoE model into multiple dense submodels, each consisting of a shared backbone and a single expert, and partitions the training data into subsets using unsupervised clustering. Each submodel is trained independently and in parallel on its assigned data subset using low-cost devices, without any inter-device communication. Subsequently, all experts are integrated into a complete MoE model and fine-tuned globally for a short period on high-memory, high-bandwidth GPUs. Experiments show that our method matches or even surpasses full-parameter training in performance across multiple downstream tasks, loss function, and perplexity (PPL), while reducing training cost by 47.6 percent to 69.5 percent on Qwen1.5-MoE-2.7B and Llama-MoE-3.5B across different datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMoE - DisCo\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f73\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u964d47.6% - 69.5%", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MoE\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u9ad8\u6210\u672cGPU\uff0c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u786c\u4ef6\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoE - DisCo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u89e3MoE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u96c6\u6210\u5fae\u8c03", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u964d\u4f4eQwen1.5 - MoE - 2.7B\u548cLlama - MoE - 3.5B\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c47.6% - 69.5%", "conclusion": "MoE - DisCo\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7528Linux\u751f\u4ea7\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f309\u4e2a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5c0f\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u7b26\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u65f6\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u65e5\u5fd7\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Linux\u751f\u4ea7\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684journalctl\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f309\u4e2a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5c0f\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u5206\u5c42\u3002Qwen3 - 4B\u7528RAG\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe95.64%\uff1bGemma3 - 1B\u7528RAG\u4ece20.25%\u63d0\u5347\u523085.28%\uff1bQwen3 - 0.6B\u65e0\u68c0\u7d22\u8868\u73b0\u5f31\u4f46\u7528RAG\u8fbe88.12%\uff1b\u90e8\u5206SRLMs\u7528RAG\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\uff0c\u591a\u6570Gemma\u548cLlama\u53d8\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u5feb\uff0cPhi - 4 - Mini - Reasoning\u6162\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6574\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u7b26\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u65f6\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u96c6\u6210\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

This setting induces a fundamental tension among three requirements, i.e., immediacy to adapt to recent behavior, stability to resist transient noise, and generalization to support long-horizon prediction and cold-start users. Most existing approaches satisfy at most two of these requirements, resulting in an inherent impossibility triangle in data-scarce, non-stationary personalization. To address this challenge, we model mobile behavior as a partially observed spatio-temporal tensor and unify short-term adaptation, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start recommendation as a conditional completion problem, where a user- and task-specific mask specifies which coordinates are treated as evidence. We propose U-MASK, a user-adaptive spatio-temporal masking method that allocates evidence budgets based on user reliability and task sensitivity. To enable mask generation under sparse observations, U-MASK learns a compact, task-agnostic user representation from app and location histories via U-SCOPE, which serves as the sole semantic conditioning signal. A shared diffusion transformer then performs mask-guided generative completion while preserving observed evidence, so personalization and task differentiation are governed entirely by the mask and the user representation. Experiments on real-world mobile datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across short-term prediction, long-horizon forecasting, and cold-start settings, with the largest gains under severe data sparsity.

To alleviate this bottleneck, we leverage diffusion models to perform semantics-preserving augmentation on the video and audio modalities, expanding the multimodal training distribution. However, increasing data quantity alone is insufficient, as diffusion-generated samples exhibit substantial quality variation and noisy augmentations may degrade performance. We therefore propose DaQ-MSA (Denoising and Qualifying Diffusion Augmentations for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis), which introduces a quality scoring module to evaluate the reliability of augmented samples and assign adaptive training weights. By down-weighting low-quality samples and emphasizing high-fidelity ones, DaQ-MSA enables more stable learning.

Finally, we illustrate the complete process of our recommendation system through a simple use case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u6392\u7a0b\u91cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u7b80\u5355\u7528\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u6392\u7a0b\u4e2d\u610f\u5916\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e38\u6253\u4e71\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u53ca\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u91cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eTimefold\u8fd9\u4e00\u5f3a\u5927AI\u9a71\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u9884\u9632\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u4e5d\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u65e8\u5728\u627e\u51fa\u80fd\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u610f\u5916\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u7684\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7528\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

We develop and validate an active learning framework that iteratively selects informative training structures for machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) from large, heterogeneous materials databases, specifically the Materials Project and OQMD. Our framework integrates compositional and property-based descriptors with a neural network ensemble model, enabling real-time uncertainty quantification via Query-by-Committee. We systematically compare four selection strategies: random sampling (baseline), uncertainty-based sampling, diversity-based sampling (k-means clustering with farthest-point refinement), and a hybrid approach balancing both objectives. Experiments across four representative material systems (elemental carbon, silicon, iron, and a titanium-oxide compound) with 5 random seeds per configuration demonstrate that diversity sampling consistently achieves competitive or superior performance, with particularly strong advantages on complex systems like titanium-oxide (10.9% improvement, p=0.008). Our results show that intelligent data selection strategies can achieve target accuracy with 5-13% fewer labeled samples compared to random baselines. The entire pipeline executes on Google Colab in under 4 hours per system using less than 8 GB of RAM, thereby democratizing MLIP development for researchers globally with limited computational resources. Our open-source code and detailed experimental configurations are available on GitHub. This multi-system evaluation establishes practical guidelines for data-efficient MLIP training and highlights promising future directions including integration with symmetry-aware neural network architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56db\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u4e14\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u8981\u6c42\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u6750\u6599\u9700\u8981\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6602\u8d35\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u5f02\u6784\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6210\u5206\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Query - by - Committee\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u56db\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6837\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u949b\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u667a\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7528\u5c115 - 13%\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u6574\u4e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u8981\u6c42\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684MLIP\u8bad\u7ec3\u5efa\u7acb\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e0e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u7b49\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We formalize the mechanism for effective teaming as a causal chain: Explainable AI (XAI) -> co-adaptation -> shared mental models (SMMs). A meta-analytic ``performance paradox\" is then examined: human-AI teams tend to show negative synergy in judgment/decision tasks (underperforming AI alone) but positive synergy in content creation and problem formulation. We trace failures to the algorithm-in-the-loop dynamic, aversion/bias asymmetries, and cumulative cognitive deskilling. We conclude with a unifying framework--combining extended-self and dual-process theories--arguing that durable gains arise when AI functions as an internalized cognitive component, yielding a unitary human-XAI symbiotic agency.

In recent years, deep learning methods have been demonstrated to outperform mechanistic models at the task of hydrological discharge simulation. Adoption of these methods has been catalysed by the proliferation of large sample hydrology datasets, consisting of the observed discharge and meteorological drivers, along with geological and topographical catchment descriptors. Deep learning methods infer rainfall-runoff characteristics that have been shown to generalise across catchments, benefitting from the data diversity in large datasets. Despite this, application to catchments in Africa has been limited. The lack of adoption of deep learning methodologies is primarily due to sparsity or lack of the spatiotemporal observational data required to enable downstream model training. We therefore investigate the application of deep learning models, including LSTMs, for hydrological discharge simulation in the transboundary Limpopo River basin, emphasising application to data scarce regions. We conduct a number of computational experiments primarily focused on assessing the impact of varying the LSTM model input data on performance. Results confirm that data constraints remain the largest obstacle to deep learning applications across African river basins. We further outline the impact of human influence on data-driven modelling which is a commonly overlooked aspect of data-driven large-sample hydrology approaches and investigate solutions for model adaptation under smaller datasets. Additionally, we include recommendations for future efforts towards seasonal hydrological discharge prediction and direct comparison or inclusion of SWAT model outputs, as well as architectural improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u975e\u6d32\u6797\u6ce2\u6ce2\u6cb3\u6d41\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6c34\u6587\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6c34\u6587\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u975e\u6d32\u6d41\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6545\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u5c55\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u975e\u6d32\u6d41\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6700\u5927\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u8fd8\u660e\u786e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6c34\u6587\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6216\u7eb3\u5165SWAT\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u53ca\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

However, standard integer quantization (e.g., INT4) fundamentally degrades per- formance by imposing a uniform grid on the heavy-tailed distribution of weight parameters, particularly in smaller-scale models (e.g., <2B parameters). We introduce HAS-VQ (Hessian-Adaptive Sparse Vec- tor Quantization), a compression framework that strictly decouples high-sensitivity outliers from the bulk weight distribution using second-order sensitivity analysis. HAS-VQ employs a Hessian-Masked Decoupling strategy to isolate sensitive parameters, followed by robust Vector Quantization (VQ) of the remaining dense body. Crucially, we introduce a residual sparse feedback mechanism that corrects quan- tization errors in the most sensitive dimensions, ensuring exact reconstruction of outliers. We evaluate HAS-VQ on SmolLM2-1.7B, demonstrating two distinct regimes of superiority: (1) Pareto Dominance over Integer Baselines: At 4.23 effective bits-per-parameter (BPP), we achieve a perplexity of 14.23, significantly outperforming the standard INT4 baseline (20.03 PPL at 4.71 BPP). (2) High-Fidelity Compression: Relative to the FP16 baseline, HAS-VQ achieves a 2.3x reduction in model size (7.03 BPP) while maintaining statistically indistinguishable perplexity (10.12 vs. 10.04), effectively offering a lossless compression alternative for bandwidth-constrained environments.

A critical assumption in existing approaches is that the data requested for unlearning are selected i.i.d.(independent and identically distributed). However,the problem of certified unlearning under non-i.i.d. deletions remains largely unexplored. In practice, unlearning requests are inherently biased, leading to non-i.i.d. deletions and causing distribution shifts between the original and retained datasets. In this paper, we show that certified unlearning with the Newton method becomes inefficient and ineffective under non-i.i.d. unlearning sets. We then propose a better certified unlearning approach by performing a distribution-aware certified unlearning framework based on iterative Newton updates constrained by a trust region. Our method provides a closer approximation to the retrained model and yields a tighter pre-run bound on the gradient residual, thereby ensuring efficient (epsilon, delta)-certified unlearning.

As a consequence of our analysis, we obtain non-asymptotic convergence bounds for clients' local iterates, confirming that DSGD has linear speed-up in the number of clients, and that the network topology only impacts higher-order terms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6052\u5b9a\u6b65\u957f\u7684DSGD\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u9896\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u7a33\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u504f\u5dee\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u83b7\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u901f\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6052\u5b9a\u6b65\u957f\u7684DSGD\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fed\u4ee3\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6765\u5f00\u5c55\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eDSGD\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u7a33\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u5dee\u4e00\u9636\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u91cf\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "DSGD\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u9ad8\u9636\u9879\u3002"}}

The growing adoption of AI presents promising results for investigative efficiency. Despite advancements, significant research gaps persist in practically understanding the legal limits of AI evidence in judicial processes. Existing literature lacks focused assessment of the evidentiary value of AI outputs. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether AI-generated evidence satisfies established legal standards of reliability. The methodology involves a comparative doctrinal legal analysis of evidentiary standards across common law jurisdictions. Preliminary results indicate that AI forensic tools can enhance scale of evidence analysis. However, challenges arise from reproducibility deficits. Courts exhibit variability in acceptance of AI evidence due to limited technical literacy and lack of standardized validation protocols. Liability implications reveal that developers and investigators may bear accountability for flawed outputs. This raises critical concerns related to wrongful conviction. The paper emphasizes the necessity of independent validation and, development of AI-specific admissibility criteria. Findings inform policy development for the responsible AI integration within criminal justice systems.

The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is a critical molecular biomarker that influences patient response to temozolomide chemotherapy. Traditional methods for determining MGMT status rely on invasive biopsies and are limited by intratumoral heterogeneity and procedural risks. This study presents a radiogenomic molecular imaging analysis framework for the non-invasive prediction of MGMT promoter methylation using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).\n  Our approach integrates radiomics, deep learning, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze MRI-derived imaging phenotypes and correlate them with molecular labels. Radiomic features are extracted from FLAIR, T1-weighted, T1-contrast-enhanced, and T2-weighted MRI sequences, while a 3D convolutional neural network learns deep representations from the same modalities. These complementary features are fused using both early fusion and attention-based strategies and classified to predict MGMT methylation status.\n  To enhance clinical interpretability, we apply XAI methods such as Grad-CAM and SHAP to visualize and explain model decisions. The proposed framework is trained on the RSNA-MICCAI Radiogenomic Classification dataset and externally validated on the BraTS 2021 dataset.

These systems employ safety mechanisms to prevent disallowed actions, including the removal of watermarks from copyrighted images. While single-turn refusals are expected, the interaction between safety filters and conversation-level state is not well understood. This study documents a reproducible behavioral effect in the ChatGPT (GPT-5.1) web interface. Manual execution was chosen to capture the exact user-facing safety behavior of the production system, rather than isolated API components. When a conversation begins with an uploaded copyrighted image and a request to remove a watermark, which the model correctly refuses, subsequent prompts to generate unrelated, benign images are refused for the remainder of the session. Importantly, text-only requests (e.g., generating a Python function) continue to succeed. Across 40 manually run sessions (30 contaminated and 10 controls), contaminated threads showed 116/120 image-generation refusals (96.67%), while control threads showed 0/40 refusals (Fisher's exact p < 0.0001). All sessions used an identical fixed prompt order, ensuring sequence uniformity across conditions. We describe this as safety-state persistence: a form of conversational over-generalization in which a copyright refusal influences subsequent, unrelated image-generation behavior. We present these findings as behavioral observations, not architectural claims. We discuss possible explanations, methodological limitations (single model, single interface), and implications for multimodal reliability, user experience, and the design of session-level safety systems.

They do not measure whether a model is reliable. This distinction is largely academic for single-shot inference, but becomes critical for agentic AI systems, where a single rephrased prompt can trigger cascading failures in multi-step execution. Yet this form of instability is not captured by existing evaluations.\n  Hallucinations live in variance: they arise when semantically equivalent prompts activate inconsistent internal pathways, producing divergent outputs. Consistent but incorrect outputs reflect bias or missing knowledge; confident guessing reflects calibration failure. Neither constitutes hallucination under this definition. When error is variance-dominated, reducing redundant pathways improves reliability without adding knowledge.

Prior work has shown that interventions applied during pretraining, such as rephrasing harmful content, can substantially improve the safety of the resulting models. In this paper, we study the fundamental question: \"When during pretraining should safety interventions be introduced?\" We keep the underlying data fixed and vary only the choice of a safety curriculum: the timing of these interventions, i.e., after 0%, 20%, or 60% of the pretraining token budget. We find that introducing interventions earlier generally yields more robust models with no increase in overrefusal rates, with the clearest benefits appearing after downstream, benign finetuning. We also see clear benefits in the steerability of models towards safer generations. Finally, we observe that earlier interventions reshape internal representations: linear probes more cleanly separate safe vs harmful examples. Overall, these results argue for incorporating safety signals early in pretraining, producing models that are more robust to downstream finetuning and jailbreaking, and more reliable under both standard and safety-aware inference procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u5e72\u9884\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u673a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u8bf8\u591a\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u7eb3\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u5b89\u5168\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5373\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u522b\u57280%\u300120%\u300160%\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u65e9\u5f15\u5165\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u62d2\u7387\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u88ab\u91cd\u5851\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u7eb3\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002"}}

Deep learning shows promise for ECG interpretation, but multi-class inherited arrhythmia classification with clinically grounded interpretability remains underdeveloped. Our objective was to develop and validate a lead-aware deep learning framework for multi-class (ARVC vs LQTS vs control) and binary inherited arrhythmia classification, and to determine optimal strategies for integrating ECG foundation models within arrhythmia screening tools. We assembled a 13-center Canadian cohort (645 patients; 1,344 ECGs). We evaluated four ECG foundation models using three transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and combined strategies. We developed lead-aware spatial attention networks (LASAN) and assessed integration strategies combining LASAN with foundation models. Performance was compared against the established foundation model baselines. Lead-group masking quantified disease-specific lead dependence. Fine-tuning outperformed linear probing and combined strategies across all foundation models (mean macro-AUROC 0.904 vs 0.825). The best lead-aware integrations achieved near-ceiling performance (HuBERT-ECG hybrid: macro-AUROC 0.990; ARVC vs control AUROC 0.999; LQTS vs control AUROC 0.994). Lead masking demonstrated physiologic plausibility: V1-V3 were most critical for ARVC detection (4.54% AUROC reduction), while lateral leads were preferentially important for LQTS (2.60% drop). Lead-aware architectures achieved state-of-the-art performance for inherited arrhythmia classification, outperforming all existing published models on both binary and multi-class tasks while demonstrating clinically aligned lead dependence.

While generative AI approaches have shown promise in designing novel dye scaffolds, prior efforts often produced synthetically intractable candidates due to a lack of reaction constraints. Here, we developed SyntheFluor-RL, a generative AI model that employs known reaction libraries and molecular building blocks to create readily synthesizable fluorescent molecule scaffolds via reinforcement learning. To guide the generation of fluorophores, SyntheFluor-RL employs a scoring function built on multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) that predict key photophysical properties, including photoluminescence quantum yield, absorption, and emission wavelengths. These outputs are dynamically weighted and combined with a computed pi-conjugation score to prioritize candidates with desirable optical characteristics and synthetic feasibility. SyntheFluor-RL generated 11,590 candidate molecules, which were filtered to 19 structures predicted to possess dye-like properties.

These workers generate and annotate data for machine learning, check outputs, and they connect with overseas AI producers via international digital labor platforms, where they perform on-demand tasks and are typically paid by piecework, with no long-term commitment. Most of these workers are young, highly educated men, with nearly two-thirds holding undergraduate degrees. Their primary motivation for data work is financial need, with three-quarters relying on platform earnings to cover basic necessities. Despite the variability in their online earnings, these are generally low, often equaling Egypt's minimum wage. Data workers' digital identities are shaped by algorithmic control and economic demands, often diverging from their offline selves.

While on-policy KD approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by learning directly from student-generated outputs, they frequently encounter training instabilities because the distributional gap between the novice student and the expert teacher is often too wide to bridge directly. These challenges manifest as pathological gradients in forward KL objectives or diversity collapse in reverse KL regimes. To address these limitations, we propose Veto, an objective-level reformulation that constructs a geometric bridge in the logit space. Unlike prior methods that mix data samples, Veto creates an intermediate target distribution that promotes alignment between the teacher and the student. By introducing a tunable parameter beta, Veto serves as an Adaptive Gradient Veto that stabilizes optimization by suppressing harmful gradients on low-confidence tokens, while simultaneously acting as a Decisiveness Knob to balance reward-driven performance with output diversity. Extensive experiments across various reasoning and generation tasks demonstrate that Veto consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing on-policy baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5931\u914d\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVeto\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565KD\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVeto\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u51e0\u4f55\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570beta\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cVeto\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "Veto\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd"}}

However, most existing schemes are predominantly optimized for simple additive white Gaussian noise or Rayleigh fading channels, neglecting the ubiquitous multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) environments that critically hinder practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose the context video semantic transmission (CVST) framework under MIMO channels. Building upon an efficient contextual video transmission backbone, CVST effectively learns a context-channel correlation map to explicitly formulate the relationships between feature groups and MIMO subchannels. Leveraging these channel-aware features, we design a multi-reference entropy coding mechanism, enabling channel state-aware variable length coding. Furthermore, CVST incorporates a checkerboard-based feature modulation strategy to achieve multiple rate points within a single trained model, thereby enhancing deployment flexibility. These innovations constitute our multi-reference variable length and rate coding (MR-VLRC) scheme. By integrating contextual transmission with MR-VLRC, CVST demonstrates substantial performance gains over various standardized separated coding methods and recent wireless video semantic communication approaches.

However, OMRL still suffers extrapolation errors due to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, compromised by broad task distributions and Markov Decision Process (MDP) ambiguity in meta-RL setups. Existing research indicates that the generalization of the $Q$ network affects the extrapolation error in offline RL. This paper investigates this relationship by decomposing the $Q$ value into feature and weight components, observing that while decomposition enhances adaptability and convergence in the case of high-quality data, it often leads to policy degeneration or collapse in complex tasks. We observe that decomposed $Q$ values introduce a large estimation bias when the feature encounters OOD samples, a phenomenon we term ''feature overgeneralization''. To address this issue, we propose FLORA, which identifies OOD samples by modeling feature distributions and estimating their uncertainties. FLORA integrates a return feedback mechanism to adaptively adjust feature components. Furthermore, to learn precise task representations, FLORA explicitly models the complex task distribution using a chain of invertible transformations.

We identify three key features of family resemblance for prototypical AI Slop: superficial competence (its veneer of quality is belied by a deeper lack of substance), asymmetry effort (it takes vastly less effort to generate than would be the case without AI), and mass producibility (it is part of a digital ecosystem of widespread generation and consumption). While AI Slop is heterogeneous and depends crucially on its medium, it tends to vary across three dimensions: instrumental utility, personalization, and surrealism. AI Slop will be an increasingly prolific and impactful part of our creative, information, and cultural economies; we should take it seriously as an object of study in its own right.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u4e0d\u5e94\u5ffd\u89c6AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u201c\u7cdf\u7c95\u201d\uff08AI Slop\uff09\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u7f8e\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u8f7b\u89c6AI Slop\u800c\u9519\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790AI Slop\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u7f8e\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9aAI Slop\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d8\u5316\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "AI Slop\u5c06\u5728\u521b\u610f\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u6108\u53d1\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002"}}

Prior research has examined how different populations prioritize Responsible AI values, yet little is known about how practitioners actually reason through the trade-offs inherent in designing these autonomous systems. This paper investigates the ethical reasoning of AI practitioners through qualitative interviews centered on structured dilemmas in agentic AI deployment. We find that the responses of practitioners do not merely reflect value preferences but rather align with three distinct reasoning frameworks. First is a Customer-Centric framework where choices are justified by business interests, legality, and user autonomy. Second is a Design-Centric framework emphasizing technical safeguards and system constraints. Third is an Ethics-Centric framework prioritizing social good and moral responsibility beyond compliance. We argue that these frameworks offer distinct and necessary insights for navigating ethical trade-offs.

However, standard methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are gradient-blind: they preserve high-variance dimensions regardless of their impact on factual knowledge preservation. We introduce Fisher-Aligned Subspace Compression (FASC), a knowledge-aware compression framework that selects subspaces by directly modeling activation-gradient coupling, minimizing a second-order surrogate of the loss function. FASC leverages the Fisher Information Matrix to identify dimensions critical for factual knowledge, which often reside in low-variance but high-gradient-sensitivity subspaces. We propose the Dependence Violation Score (\\r{ho}) as a general-purpose diagnostic metric that quantifies activation-gradient coupling, revealing where factual knowledge is stored within transformer architectures. Extensive experiments on Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B demonstrate that FASC preserves 6-8% more accuracy on knowledge-intensive benchmarks (MMLU, LAMA) compared to variance-based methods at 50% rank reduction, effectively enabling a 7B model to match the factual recall of a 13B uncompressed model. Our analysis reveals that \\r{ho} serves as a fundamental signal of stored knowledge, with high-\\r{ho} layers emerging only when models internalize factual associations during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6FASC\u53ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fdd\u89c4\u5206\u6570\u03c1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFASC\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SVD\uff09\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165FASC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u6fc0\u6d3b - \u68af\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fdd\u89c4\u5206\u6570\u03c1\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6fc0\u6d3b - \u68af\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728Mistral - 7B\u548cLlama - 3 - 8B\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cFASC\u572850%\u79e9\u7ea6\u7b80\u65f6\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u591a\u4fdd\u75596 - 8%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f7B\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523013B\u672a\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03c1\u662f\u5b58\u50a8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9ad8\u03c1\u5c42\u4ec5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5185\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5173\u8054\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u3002"}}

This study evaluates the environmental footprint of AI server operations and examines feasible technological and infrastructural strategies to mitigate these impacts. Using a literature-based methodology supported by quantitative projections and case-study analysis, we assessed trends in global electricity consumption, cooling-related water use, and carbon emissions. Projections indicate that global data center electricity demand may increase from approximately 415 TWh in 2024 to nearly 945 TWh by 2030, with AI workloads accounting for a disproportionate share of this growth. In the United States alone, AI servers are expected to drive annual increases in water consumption of 200--300 billion gallons and add 24--44 million metric tons of CO2 quivalent emissions by 2030. The results show that the design of the cooling system and the geographic location influence the environmental impact as strongly as the efficiency of the hardware. Advanced cooling technologies can reduce cooling energy by up to 50%, while location in low-carbon and water-secure regions can cut combined footprints by nearly half.

This paper investigates the effect of training objective composition on reasoning reliability through Direct Preference Optimization. Two complementary training signals are examined: forward chain-of-thought generation, which trains the model to produce correct reasoning traces, and backward verification, which trains the model to verify and acknowledge errors in candidate solutions. Experiments on GSM8K reveal a fundamental trade-off between these objectives. Forward-only DPO training achieves the highest accuracy improvement, increasing from 83.1% to 86.6% (+3.5 percentage points), while backward-only training yields minimal accuracy gains but substantially reduces the false positive rate from 13.4% to 4.3%. Notably, both training variants reduce acknowledgement rate compared to the baseline, suggesting that preference optimization increases model confidence in its outputs. These findings indicate that forward and backward reasoning objectives provide distinct and complementary learning signals: forward training improves problem-solving capability, while backward training improves verification calibration.

Recent research on agentic AI has largely focused on technical foundations, including system architectures, reasoning and planning mechanisms, coordination strategies, and application-level performance across domains. However, the societal, ethical, economic, environmental, and governance implications of agentic AI remain weakly integrated into these technical treatments. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a socio-technical analysis of agentic AI that explicitly connects core technical components with societal context. We examine how architectural choices in perception, cognition, planning, execution, and memory introduce dependencies related to data governance, accountability, transparency, safety, and sustainability. To structure this analysis, we adopt the MAD-BAD-SAD construct as an analytical lens, capturing motivations, applications, and moral dilemmas (MAD); biases, accountability, and dangers (BAD); and societal impact, adoption, and design considerations (SAD). Using this lens, we analyze ethical considerations, implications, and challenges arising from contemporary agentic AI systems and assess their manifestation across emerging applications, including healthcare, education, industry, smart and sustainable cities, social services, communications and networking, and earth observation and satellite communications. The paper further identifies open challenges and suggests future research directions, framing agentic AI as an integrated socio-technical system whose behavior and impact are co-produced by algorithms, data, organizational practices, regulatory frameworks, and social norms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u7528MAD - BAD - SAD\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u7b49\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u6b64\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528MAD - BAD - SAD\u6784\u5efa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u6280\u672f\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u4ee3\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65b0\u5174\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u5171\u540c\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While existing defenses attempt to mitigate this via data selection, they typically rely on heuristic, instance-level assessments that neglect the global geometry of the data distribution and fail to explicitly repel harmful patterns. To address this, we introduce Safety Optimal Transport (SOT), a novel framework that reframes safe fine-tuning from an instance-level filtering challenge to a distribution-level alignment task grounded in Optimal Transport (OT). At its core is a dual-reference ``push-pull'' weight-learning mechanism: SOT optimizes sample importance by actively pulling the downstream distribution towards a trusted safe anchor while simultaneously pushing it away from a general harmful reference. This establishes a robust geometric safety boundary that effectively purifies the training data.

Real-world deployments reveal that even advanced models are insufficient without extensive architectural scaffolding to ensure reliability. Current evaluation frameworks are fragmented: institutional policies lack technical verification, pedagogical guidelines assume AI reliability, and technical metrics are context-agnostic. This leaves institutions without a unified standard for deployment readiness. This paper introduces TEAS (Trusted Educational AI Standard), an integrated framework built on four interdependent pillars: (1) Verifiability, grounding content in authoritative sources; (2) Stability, ensuring deterministic core knowledge; (3) Auditability, enabling independent institutional validation; and (4) Pedagogical Soundness, enforcing principles of active learning. We argue that trustworthiness stems primarily from systematic architecture, not raw model capability.

To address this, we propose MAESTRO (Meta-learning Adaptive Estimation of Scalarization Trade-offs for Reward Optimization), which introduces a meta-cognitive orchestration layer that treats reward scalarization as a dynamic latent policy, leveraging the model's terminal hidden states as a semantic bottleneck to perceive task-specific priorities.

The defined quantities are decision-theoretic, but have information-theoretic analogues, e.g., they share some simple but key mathematical properties with Shannon entropy and mutual information, and can reduce to these quantities in particular settings. One interesting observation is that, the value of perception without prediction can be negative, while the value of perception together with prediction and the value of prediction alone are always nonnegative.

Example questions include: Do we need to observe and predict the behavior of a particular agent? How important is it? What is the best order to observe and predict the agents?

To address these issues, we propose DDT, a novel and robust deep learning framework for high-precision time-series forecasting. At its core, DDT introduces two key innovations. First, we design a dual-masking mechanism that synergistically combines a strict causal mask with a data-driven dynamic mask. This novel design ensures theoretical causal consistency while adaptively focusing on the most salient historical information, overcoming the rigidity of traditional masking techniques. Second, our architecture features a dual-expert system that decouples the modeling of temporal dynamics and cross-variable correlations into parallel, specialized pathways, which are then intelligently integrated through a dynamic gated fusion module. We conducted extensive experiments on 7 challenging energy benchmark datasets, including ETTh, Electricity, and Solar. The results demonstrate that DDT consistently outperforms strong state-of-the-art baselines across all prediction horizons, establishing a new benchmark for the task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6DDT\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u80fd\u6e90\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u7535\u7f51\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6574\u5408\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDDT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53cc\u63a9\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff08\u4e25\u683c\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u7ed3\u5408\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u79bb\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDDT\u5728\u6240\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DDT\u4e3a\u80fd\u6e90\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u6811\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

We explain this ``missing capacity'' by introducing the innovation capacity $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the total capacity allocated to readout components orthogonal to the input filtration (Doob innovations, including input-noise mixing). Using a basis-free Hilbert-space formulation of the predictable/innovation decomposition, we prove the conservation law $C_{\\mathrm{ip}}+C_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\mathrm{rank}(\u03a3_{XX})\\le d$, so predictable and innovation capacities exactly partition the rank of the observable readout dimension covariance $\u03a3_{XX}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\rm d\\times d}$. In linear-Gaussian Johnson-Nyquist regimes, $\u03a3_{XX}(T)=S+T N_0$, the split becomes a generalized-eigenvalue shrinkage rule and gives an explicit monotone tradeoff between temperature and predictable capacity. Geometrically, in whitened coordinates the predictable and innovation components correspond to complementary covariance ellipsoids, making $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ a trace-controlled innovation budget. A large $C_{\\mathrm{i}}$ forces a high-dimensional innovation subspace with a variance floor and under mild mixing and anti-concentration assumptions this yields extensive innovation-block differential entropy and exponentially many distinguishable histories. Finally, we give an information-theoretic lower bound showing that learning the induced innovation-block law in total variation requires a number of samples that scales with the effective innovation dimension, supporting the generative utility of noisy physical reservoirs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Guided by a Design Science Research approach, the system was developed as a school-mimetic digital infrastructure aligned with the organizational logic of Ghanaian Colleges of Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA) framework. GenAITEd Ghana operates as a multi-agent, retrieval-augmented conversational AI that coordinates multiple models for curriculum-grounded dialogue, automatic speech recognition, voice synthesis, and multimedia interaction. Two complementary prompt pathways were embedded: system-level prompts that enforce curriculum boundaries, ethical constraints, and teacher-in-the-loop oversight, and interaction-level semi-automated prompts that structure live pedagogical dialogue through clarification, confirmation, and guided response generation. Evaluation findings show that the system effectively enacted key Responsible AI principles, including transparency, accountability, cultural responsiveness, privacy, and human oversight.

Existing systems typically downsample frames or feed dense visual embeddings to large-context language models, trading off temporal coverage against cost. We propose Semantic Event Graphs (SEG), a lightweight symbolic interface between video and language that replaces raw frames with compact temporal interaction logs. Our pipeline detects and tracks objects with YOLOv11, converts proximity patterns into START/END human-object events, and organizes them into a Temporal Scene Graph (TSG). At inference time, a query-aware pruning module identifies anchor entities and lexically relevant events, returning only a small subgraph which is verbalized and passed to Gemini 2.5 Flash for answer generation. On five YouTube videos (300-500 interactions each) and 120 automatically generated long-horizon questions, SEG achieves 65.0% accuracy using only 3.47k tokens per query, closely matching a full-log baseline (62.5% at 40.39k tokens) while reducing token usage by 91.4%. A short-context baseline restricted to the last 30 seconds collapses to 2.5% accuracy, underscoring the need for explicit temporal memory. These results show that symbolic temporal graphs can serve as an effective, plug-and-play memory layer for off-the-shelf vision-language models, preserving long-range reasoning ability while making long-form video question answering substantially more token- and cost-efficient.

This limits the effectiveness of feature selection. In addition, existing methods fuse similarity graphs from multiple views by employing sample-invariant weights to preserve local structure. However, this process fails to account for differences in local neighborhood clarity among samples within each view, thereby hindering accurate characterization of the intrinsic local structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a Kernel Alignment-based multi-view unsupervised FeatUre selection with Sample-level adaptive graph lEarning method (KAFUSE) to address these issues. Specifically, we first employ kernel alignment with an orthogonal constraint to reduce feature redundancy in both linear and nonlinear relationships. Then, a cross-view consistent similarity graph is learned by applying sample-level fusion to each slice of a tensor formed by stacking similarity graphs from different views, which automatically adjusts the view weights for each sample during fusion. These two steps are integrated into a unified model for feature selection, enabling mutual enhancement between them.

Existing work has primarily relied on either self-report (SR) or objective-based (OB) assessments, with few studies aligning the two within a shared framework to compare perceived versus demonstrated competencies or examine how prior AI literacy experience shapes this relationship. This gap limits the scalability of learning analytics and the development of learner profile-driven instructional design. In this study, we developed and evaluated SR and OB measures of teacher AI literacy within the established framework of Concept, Use, Evaluate, and Ethics. Confirmatory factor analyses support construct validity with good reliability and acceptable fit. Results reveal a low correlation between SR and OB factors. Latent profile analysis identified six distinct profiles, including overestimation (SR > OB), underestimation (SR < OB), alignment (SR close to OB), and a unique low-SR/low-OB profile among teachers without AI literacy experience.

This lack of transparency hinders users' ability to understand, validate and trust model behavior, particularly in high-risk applications. Although explainable AI (XAI) has made significant progress, there remains a need for versatile and effective techniques to address increasingly complex models. This work introduces Multivariate Conditional Expectation (MUCE), a model-agnostic method for local explainability designed to capture prediction changes from feature interactions. MUCE extends Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by exploring a multivariate grid of values in the neighborhood of a given observation at inference time, providing graphical explanations that illustrate the local evolution of model predictions. In addition, two quantitative indices, stability and uncertainty, summarize local behavior and assess model reliability. Uncertainty is further decomposed into uncertainty+ and uncertainty- to capture asymmetric effects that global measures may overlook. The proposed method is validated using XGBoost models trained on three datasets: two synthetic (2D and 3D) to evaluate behavior near decision boundaries, and one transformed real-world dataset to test adaptability to heterogeneous feature types. Results show that MUCE effectively captures complex local model behavior, while the stability and uncertainty indices provide meaningful insight into prediction confidence. MUCE, together with the ICE modification and the proposed indices, offers a practical contribution to local explainability, enabling both graphical and quantitative insights that enhance the interpretability of predictive models and support more trustworthy and transparent decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5MUCE\uff0c\u7ecf\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u6dfb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742AI\u548cML\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u73b0\u5b58\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\u5f85\u63d0\u5347\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MUCE\u65b9\u6cd5\u62d3\u5c55ICE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u89c2\u6d4b\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u591a\u5143\u7f51\u683c\u503c\u63a2\u7d22\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u56fe\u5f62\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u660eMUCE\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u590d\u6742\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "conclusion": "MUCE\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u900f\u660e\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision.

However, the practical application of PPO is hindered by unreliable advantage estimation in the sparse-reward RLVR regime. This issue arises because the sparse rewards in RLVR lead to inaccurate intermediate value predictions, which in turn introduce significant bias when aggregated at every token by Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). To address this, we introduce Segmental Advantage Estimation (SAE), which mitigates the bias that GAE can incur in RLVR. Our key insight is that aggregating $n$-step advantages at every token(as in GAE) is unnecessary and often introduces excessive bias, since individual tokens carry minimal information. Instead, SAE first partitions the generated sequence into coherent sub-segments using low-probability tokens as heuristic boundaries. It then selectively computes variance-reduced advantage estimates only from these information-rich segment transitions, effectively filtering out noise from intermediate tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that SAE achieves superior performance, with marked improvements in final scores, training stability, and sample efficiency. These gains are shown to be consistent across multiple model sizes, and a correlation analysis confirms that our proposed advantage estimator achieves a higher correlation with an approximate ground-truth advantage, justifying its superior performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u6bb5\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08SAE\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u8f83\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "PPO \u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLVR\uff09\u65b9\u6848\u65f6\uff0c\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5373\u5e7f\u4e49\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08GAE\uff09\u4f1a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0a\u805a\u5408\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u6bb5\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08SAE\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u6807\u8bb0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8fb9\u754c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u8fde\u8d2f\u5b50\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6bb5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e SAE \u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5206\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9e\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "SAE \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3 RLVR \u4e2d GAE \u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent Scientific Foundation Models (SFMs) aim to alleviate this cost by learning universal surrogates from large collections of simulated systems, yet they typically rely on monolithic architectures with limited interpretability and high pretraining expense. In this work we introduce Compositional Neural Operators (CompNO), a compositional neural operator framework for parametric PDEs. Instead of pretraining a single large model on heterogeneous data, CompNO first learns a library of Foundation Blocks, where each block is a parametric Fourier neural operator specialized to a fundamental differential operator (e.g. convection, diffusion, nonlinear convection). These blocks are then assembled, via lightweight Adaptation Blocks, into task-specific solvers that approximate the temporal evolution operator for target PDEs. A dedicated boundary-condition operator further enforces Dirichlet constraints exactly at inference time. We validate CompNO on one-dimensional convection, diffusion, convection--diffusion and Burgers' equations from the PDEBench suite. The proposed framework achieves lower relative L2 error than strong baselines (PFNO, PDEFormer and in-context learning based models) on linear parametric systems, while remaining competitive on nonlinear Burgers' flows. The model maintains exact boundary satisfaction with zero loss at domain boundaries, and exhibits robust generalization across a broad range of Peclet and Reynolds numbers.

This case report documents a three day online professional development programme organised by Generative AI for Education and Research in Africa (GenAI-ERA), designed to strengthen educators and researchers capacity to apply prompt engineering ethically for academic writing, teaching, and research. The programme engaged 468 participants across multiple African countries, including university educators, postgraduate students, and researchers. The training followed a scaffolded progression from foundational prompt design to applied and ethical strategies, including persona guided interactions. Data sources comprised registration surveys, webinar interaction records, facilitator observations, and session transcripts, analysed using descriptive statistics and computationally supported qualitative techniques. Findings indicate that participants increasingly conceptualised prompt engineering as a form of AI literacy requiring ethical awareness, contextual sensitivity, and pedagogical judgement rather than technical skill alone.

While existing works have shown that vision-language models (VLMs) can assist RL, they often focus on knowledge distillation from the VLM to RL, overlooking the potential of RL-generated interaction data to enhance the VLM. To address this, we propose COVR, a collaborative optimization framework that enables the mutual enhancement of the VLM and RL policies. Specifically, COVR fine-tunes the VLM with RL-generated data to enhance the semantic reasoning ability consistent with the target task, and uses the enhanced VLM to further guide policy learning via action priors. To improve fine-tuning efficiency, we introduce two key modules: (1) an Exploration-Driven Dynamic Filter module that preserves valuable exploration samples using adaptive thresholds based on the degree of exploration, and (2) a Return-Aware Adaptive Loss Weight module that improves the stability of training by quantifying the inconsistency of sampling actions via return signals of RL. We further design a progressive fine-tuning strategy to reduce resource consumption.

As these models integrate into high-stakes systems, understanding how they encode capabilities has become fundamental to interpretability research. Traditional approaches identify important modules through gradient attribution or activation analysis, assuming specific capabilities map to specific components. However, this oversimplifies neural computation: modules may contribute to multiple capabilities simultaneously, while single capabilities may distribute across multiple modules. These coarse-grained analyses fail to capture fine-grained, distributed capability encoding. We present SCALPEL (Selective Capability Ablation via Low-rank Parameter Editing for Large language models), a framework representing capabilities as low-rank parameter subspaces rather than discrete modules. Our key insight is that capabilities can be characterized by low-rank modifications distributed across layers and modules, enabling precise capability removal without affecting others. By training LoRA adapters to reduce distinguishing correct from incorrect answers while preserving general language modeling quality, SCALPEL identifies low-rank representations responsible for particular capabilities while remaining disentangled from others. Experiments across diverse capability and linguistic tasks from BLiMP demonstrate that SCALPEL successfully removes target capabilities while preserving general capabilities, providing fine-grained insights into capability distribution across parameter space. Results reveal that capabilities exhibit low-rank structure and can be selectively ablated through targeted parameter-space interventions, offering nuanced understanding of capability encoding in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7c97\u7cd9\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSCALPEL\u6846\u67b6\u7cbe\u51c6\u79fb\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u529b\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCALPEL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u80fd\u529b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u53c2\u6570\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u964d\u4f4e\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSCALPEL\u6210\u529f\u79fb\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u5448\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e72\u9884\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6d88\u878d\u3002", "conclusion": "SCALPEL\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7f16\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002"}}

Scoring functions, as one of the tools guiding virtual screening, have their precision closely tied to screening efficiency. In our previous study, we developed a graph neural network model called PLANET (Protein-Ligand Affinity prediction NETwork), but it suffers from the defect in representing protein-ligand contact maps. Incorrect binding modes inevitably lead to poor affinity predictions, so accurate prediction of the protein-ligand contact map is desired to improve PLANET. In this study, we have proposed PLANET v2.0 as an upgraded version. The model is trained via multi-objective training strategy and incorporates the Mixture Density Network to predict binding modes. Except for the probability density distributions of non-covalent interactions, we innovatively employ another Gaussian mixture model to describe the relationship between distance and energy of each interaction pair and predict protein-ligand affinity like calculating the mathematical expectation. As on the CASF-2016 benchmark, PLANET v2.0 demonstrates excellent scoring power, ranking power, and docking power. The screening power of PLANET v2.0 gets notably improved compared to PLANET and Glide SP and it demonstrates robust validation on a commercial ultra-large-scale dataset. Given its efficiency and accuracy, PLANET v2.0 can hopefully become one of the practical tools for virtual screening workflows.

Subjective opinions and political bias can be found in media sources, such as newspapers, depending on their funding mechanisms and alliances with political parties. Automating the detection of political biases in media content can limit biases in elections. The impact of large language models (LLMs) in politics and media studies is becoming prominent. In this study, we utilise LLMs to compare the left-wing, right-wing, and neutral political opinions expressed in the Guardian and BBC. We review newspaper reporting that includes significant events such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Hamas-Israel conflict. We analyse the proportion for each opinion to find the bias under different LLMs, including BERT, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our results show that after the outbreak of the wars, the political bias of Western media shifts towards the left-wing and each LLM gives a different result. DeepSeek consistently showed a stable Left-leaning tendency, while BERT and Gemini remained closer to the Centre. The BBC and The Guardian showed distinct reporting behaviours across the two conflicts. In the Russia-Ukraine war, both outlets maintained relatively stable positions; however, in the Israel-Hamas conflict, we identified larger political bias shifts, particularly in Guardian coverage, suggesting a more event-driven pattern of reporting bias. These variations suggest that LLMs are shaped not only by their training data and architecture, but also by underlying worldviews with associated political biases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u300a\u536b\u62a5\u300b\u548cBBC\u5728\u4fc4\u4e4c\u6218\u4e89\u3001\u5df4\u4ee5\u51b2\u7a81\u62a5\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u897f\u65b9\u5a92\u4f53\u6218\u540e\u504f\u5411\u5de6\u7ffc\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u62a5\u9053\u503e\u5411\u53d7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u9009\u4e3e\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08BERT\u3001Gemini\u3001DeepSeek\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u300a\u536b\u62a5\u300b\u548cBBC\u62a5\u9053\u4e2d\u5de6\u53f3\u7ffc\u53ca\u4e2d\u7acb\u653f\u6cbb\u89c2\u70b9\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u6218\u540e\u897f\u65b9\u5a92\u4f53\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\u504f\u5411\u5de6\u7ffc\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cDeepSeek\u7a33\u5b9a\u5de6\u503e\uff0cBERT\u548cGemini\u66f4\u5c45\u4e2d\uff1b\u4e24\u5a92\u4f53\u5728\u4e24\u573a\u51b2\u7a81\u4e2d\u62a5\u9053\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u522b\uff0c\u5df4\u4ee5\u51b2\u7a81\u4e2d\u504f\u89c1\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d7\u6f5c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

This work presents a novel Surrogate-Based Optimization framework based on Clustering, SBOC for global optimization of such systems, which can be used with any surrogate modeling technique. At each iteration, it uses a single surrogate model for the entire domain, employs k-means clustering to identify unexplored domain, and exploits a local region around the surrogate optimum to potentially add three new sample points in the domain. SBOC has been tested against sixteen promising benchmarking algorithms using 52 analytical test functions of varying input dimensionalities and shape profiles. It successfully identified a global minimum for most test functions with substantially lower computational effort than other algorithms. It worked especially well on test functions with four or more input variables. It was also among the top six algorithms in approaching a global minimum closely.

We use a dataset of 701 parallel verses of the Bhagavad Gita, which comprises three languages-Sanskrit, English, and Hindi along with transliteration of Sanskrit into English. We test tokenizers including SentencePiece (SPM), older GPT models, and the latest generation tokenizers from Gemini and GPT. We use metrics of token count, characters per token (token efficiency), and tokens per character (token cost). Results show a ~2x difference in token counts between Sanskrit and English/Hindi under the unbiased SPM baseline. English/Hindi translations of Sanskrit commentary resulted in an approximately 20x increase in token count. GPT o200k base (latest, used by GPT-4o) and Gemini (latest) reduce bias by a significant degree compared to GPT cl100k base (used until GPT-4), but still fail to fully capture Sanskrit's compactness. This matters because there might be a penalty bias for non-English users, which inflates the token count. This research provides a foundation for improving future tokenizer design and shows the potential of Sanskrit for highly compact encoding, saving on cost while speeding up training and inference.

However, obtaining fully annotated data for all tasks is impractical due to labeling costs. Existing methods for partially labeled MTL typically rely on predictions from unlabeled tasks, making it difficult to establish reliable task associations and potentially leading to negative transfer and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics.

The work presents a theoretical framework rooted in Chemical Organization Theory (COT) to characterize how stable, self-sustaining structures arise from the interactions of basic components. Key theoretical contributions include the formalization of atom sets as fundamental reactive units and the concept of synergy to describe the emergence of new reactions and species from the interaction of these units. The property of separability is defined to distinguish dynamically coupled systems from those that can be decomposed. This framework is then applied to the STARLIB nuclear reaction network database, analyzing how network structure, particularly the formation and properties of atom sets and semi-self-maintaining sets, changes as a function of temperature. Results indicate that increasing temperature generally enhances network cohesion, leading to fewer, larger atom sets. Critical temperatures are identified where significant structural reorganizations occur, such as the merging of distinct clusters of atom sets and the disappearance of small, isolated reactive units. The analysis reveals core clusters - large (containing more that 1000 reactions), semi-self-maintaining structures that appear to form the core of all potentially stable nucleosynthetic configurations at various temperatures.

However, it is difficult to adapt existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies to these formats: rotation-based methods compromise fine-grained block isolation; smoothing techniques struggle with significant 4-bit quantization errors; and mixed-precision approaches often conflict with hardware constraints on unified-precision computation. To address these challenges, we propose ARCQuant, a framework that boosts NVFP4 performance via Augmented Residual Channels. Distinct from methods that compromise block isolation or hardware uniformity, ARCQuant maintains a strictly unified NVFP4 format by augmenting the activation matrix with quantized residual channels. This design integrates the error compensation process directly into the matrix reduction dimension, enabling the use of standard, highly optimized GEMM kernels with minimal overhead. Theoretical analysis confirms that the worst-case error bound of our dual-stage NVFP4 quantization is comparable to that of standard 8-bit formats such as MXFP8. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that ARCQuant achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable to full-precision baselines in perplexity and downstream tasks.

Health AI practitioners should prioritize successful adaptation into clinical practice in order to provide meaningful benefits to patients, but translation usually requires collaboration with industry. We discuss three features of AI studies that hamper the integration of AI into clinical practice from the perspective of researchers and clinicians. These include lack of clinically relevant metrics, lack of clinical trials and longitudinal studies to validate results, and lack of patient and physician involvement in the development process. For partnerships between industry and health research to be sustainable, a balance must be established between patient and industry benefit. We propose three approaches for addressing this gap: improved transparency and explainability of AI models, fostering relationships with industry partners that have a reputation for centering patient benefit in their practices, and prioritization of overall healthcare benefits.

Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps.

We extend this theory to deep reinforcement learning, proving that the concentration of the generalized posterior over policies is governed by the local learning coefficient (LLC), an invariant of the geometry of the regret function. This theory predicts that Bayesian phase transitions in reinforcement learning should proceed from simple policies with high regret to complex policies with low regret. We verify this prediction empirically in a gridworld environment exhibiting stagewise policy development: phase transitions over SGD training manifest as \"opposing staircases\" where regret decreases sharply while the LLC increases. Notably, the LLC detects phase transitions even when estimated on a subset of states where the policies appear identical in terms of regret, suggesting it captures changes in the underlying algorithm rather than just performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u5947\u5f02\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5e7f\u4e49\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u7531\u5c40\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\uff08LLC\uff09\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u76f8\u53d8\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u5947\u5f02\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u76f8\u53d8\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5e7f\u4e49\u540e\u9a8c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u7531\u5c40\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\uff08LLC\uff09\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u76f8\u53d8\u4ece\u9ad8\u540e\u6094\u5ea6\u7b80\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u5230\u4f4e\u540e\u6094\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0aSGD\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u540e\u6094\u5ea6\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u800cLLC\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e14LLC\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u76f8\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "LLC\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5e95\u5c42\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u3002"}}

However, the effects of harnessing the same automation to create useful bots are not well explored. To address this, we create BotSim, an Agent-Based Model of a society in which useful bots are introduced into a small world network. These useful bots are: Info-Correction Bots, which correct bad information into good, and Good Bots, which put out good messaging. The simulated agents interact through generating, consuming and propagating information. Our results show that, left unchecked, Bad Bots can create a conspiratorial society, and this can be mitigated by either Info-Correction Bots or Good Bots; however, Good Bots are more efficient and sustainable than Info-Correction Bots . Proactive good messaging is more resource-effective than reactive information correction.

Although diffusion-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have been exploited for CKM construction, they rely on iterative stochastic sampling, rendering them too slow for real-time wireless applications. To bridge the gap between high fidelity and efficient CKM construction, this letter introduces a novel framework based on linear transport guided flow matching (LT-GFM). Deviating from the noise-removal paradigm of diffusion models, our approach models the CKM generation process as a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) that follows linear optimal transport paths, thereby drastically reducing the number of required inference steps. We propose a unified architecture that is applicable to not only the conventional channel gain map (CGM) construction, but also the more challenging spatial correlation map (SCM) construction. To achieve physics-informed CKM constructions, we integrate environmental semantics (e.g., building masks) for edge recovery and enforce Hermitian symmetry for property of the SCM.

Although deep learning approaches, particularly those leveraging Contrastive Learning (CL), are prominent for MTS representation, existing CL-based models face two key limitations: 1) neglecting clustering information during positive/negative sample pair construction, and 2) introducing unreasonable inductive biases, e.g., destroying time dependence and periodicity through augmentation strategies, compromising representation quality. This paper, therefore, proposes a Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive (TFEC) learning framework. To preserve temporal structure while generating low-distortion representations, a temporal-frequency Co-EnHancement (CoEH) mechanism is introduced. Accordingly, a synergistic dual-path representation and cluster distribution learning framework is designed to jointly optimize cluster structure and representation fidelity. Experiments on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate TFEC's superiority, achieving 4.48% average NMI gains over SOTA methods, with ablation studies validating the design.

To address this limitation, we propose d3LLM (Pseudo-Distilled Diffusion Large Language Model), striking a balance between accuracy and parallelism: (i) during training, we introduce pseudo-trajectory distillation to teach the model which tokens can be decoded confidently at early steps, thereby improving parallelism; (ii) during inference, we employ entropy-based multi-block decoding with a KV-cache refresh mechanism to achieve high parallelism while maintaining accuracy. To better evaluate dLLMs, we also introduce AUP (Accuracy Under Parallelism), a new metric that jointly measures accuracy and parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that our d3LLM achieves up to 10$\\times$ speedup over vanilla LLaDA/Dream and 5$\\times$ speedup over AR models without much accuracy drop.

This narrow framing risks reinforcing equity gaps and only rewarding the already privileged or motivated students. We argue instead for a shift toward collective intelligence (CI)-focused pedagogy, where GenAI acts as a catalyst for peer-to-peer learning. We implemented Generative CI (GCI) activities in two undergraduate engineering courses, engaging 140 students through thinking routines -- short, repeatable scaffolds developed by Harvard Project Zero to make thinking visible and support collaborative sense-making. Using routines such as Question Sorts and Peel the Fruit, combined with strategic AI consultation, we enabled students to externalize their reasoning, compare interpretations, and iteratively refine ideas. Our dual-pronged approach synthesizes literature from learning sciences, CI, embodied cognition, and philosophy of technology, while also empirically learning through student surveys and engagement observations. Results demonstrate that students value the combination of human collaboration with strategic AI support, recognizing risks of over-reliance while appreciating AI's role in expanding perspectives. Students identified that group work fosters deeper understanding and creative problem-solving than AI alone, with the timing of AI consultation significantly affecting learning outcomes.

Yet decades of research in automation psychology, human factors, and human-computer interaction provide crucial insights that remain underutilized in educational AI design. This work synthesizes four research traditions -- automation psychology, human factors engineering, HCI, and philosophy of technology -- to establish a comprehensive framework for understanding how learners psychologically relate to anthropomorphic AI tutors. We identify three persistent challenges intensified by Generative AI's conversational fluency. First, learners exhibit dual trust calibration failures -- automation bias (uncritical acceptance) and algorithm aversion (excessive rejection after errors) -- with an expertise paradox where novices overrely while experts underrely. Second, while anthropomorphic design enhances engagement, it can distract from learning and foster harmful emotional attachment. Third, automation ironies persist: systems meant to aid cognition introduce designer errors, degrade skills through disuse, and create monitoring burdens humans perform poorly. We ground this theoretical synthesis through comparative analysis of over 104,984 YouTube comments across AI-generated philosophical debates and human-created engineering tutorials, revealing domain-dependent trust patterns and strong anthropomorphic projection despite minimal cues. For engineering education, our synthesis mandates differentiated approaches: AI tutoring for technical foundations where automation bias is manageable through proper scaffolding, but human facilitation for design, ethics, and professional judgment where tacit knowledge transmission proves irreplaceable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u5408\u56db\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u6846\u67b6\u7406\u89e3\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4e0e\u62df\u4eba\u5316AI\u5bfc\u5e08\u5fc3\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5206\u6790YouTube\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u63d0\u4f9b\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u5bfc\u5e08\u90e8\u7f72\u901f\u5ea6\u8d85\u5bf9\u5176\u5fc3\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fc7\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u5728\u6559\u80b2AI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u5408\u56db\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8d85104,984\u6761YouTube\u8bc4\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\u6821\u51c6\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f0a\u7aef\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u77db\u76fe\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u62df\u4eba\u6295\u5c04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u9700\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u7528AI\u8f85\u5bfc\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u7b49\u9760\u4eba\u7c7b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, performance can drop considerably when there is a shift in the distribution of data from training to test time. We study this phenomenon in a setting in which the training data come from multiple domains, and the test data come from a domain not seen at training that is subject to significant covariate shift. We present a new method for contrastive learning that incorporates domain labels to increase the domain invariance of learned representations, leading to improved out-of-distribution generalization. Our method adjusts the temperature parameter in the InfoNCE loss -- which controls the relative weighting of negative pairs -- using the probability that a negative sample comes from the same domain as the anchor. This upweights pairs from more similar domains, encouraging the model to discriminate samples based on domain-invariant attributes. Through experiments on a variant of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our method yields better out-of-distribution performance than domain generalization baselines.

However, when looking at the emissions of datacenters from worldwide service providers, we observe a rapid increase aligned with the advent of AI. Some actors justify it by claiming that the increase of emissions for digital infrastructures is acceptable as it could help the decarbonization of other sectors, e.g., videoconference tools instead of taking the plane for a meeting abroad, or using AI to optimize and reduce energy consumption. With such conflicting claims and ambitions, it is unclear how the net environmental impact of AI could be quantified. The answer is prone to uncertainty for different reasons, among others: lack of transparency, interference with market expectations, lack of standardized methodology for quantifying direct and indirect impact, and the quick evolutions of models and their requirements.\n  This report provides answers and clarifications to these different elements. Firstly, we consider the direct environmental impact of AI from a top-down approach, starting from general information and communication technologies (ICT) and then zooming in on data centers and the different phases of AI development and deployment.

However, the original KAN formulation relies on B-spline basis functions, which incur substantial computational overhead due to De Boor's algorithm. To address this limitation, recent work has explored alternative basis functions such as radial basis functions (RBFs) that can improve computational efficiency and flexibility. Yet, standard RBF-KANs often sacrifice accuracy relative to the original KAN design. In this work, we propose Free-RBF-KAN, a RBF-based KAN architecture that incorporates adaptive learning grids and trainable smoothness to close this performance gap. Our method employs freely learnable RBF shapes that dynamically align grid representations with activation patterns, enabling expressive and adaptive function approximation. Additionally, we treat smoothness as a kernel parameter optimized jointly with network weights, without increasing computational complexity. We provide a general universality proof for RBF-KANs, which encompasses our Free-RBF-KAN formulation.

Our evaluation of several frontier models reveals a critical dissociation: models are neither cost-aware when articulating their verbal confidence, nor strategically responsive when deciding whether to engage or abstain under high-penalty conditions. Even when extreme penalties render frequent abstention the mathematically optimal strategy, models almost never abstain, resulting in utility collapse.

We evaluate DT-ICU on the large, publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset, where it consistently outperforms established baseline models under different evaluation settings. Our test-length analysis shows that meaningful discrimination is achieved shortly after admission, while longer observation windows further improve the ranking of high-risk patients in highly imbalanced cohorts.

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have also gained momentum due to their potential to support individuals with complex disabilities. Among BCI paradigms, code-modulated Visual Evoked Potentials (c-VEPs) remain relatively understudied, despite offering high information transfer rates and large selection target capacities. However, c-VEP systems require lengthy calibration sessions, limiting their practicality outside of laboratory settings. In this study, we use a FM for the first time to eliminate the need for lengthy calibration in c-VEP BCI systems. We evaluated two approaches: (1) a truly calibration-free approach requiring no subject-specific data, and (2) a limited calibration approach, where we assessed the benefit of incorporating incremental amounts of calibration data. In both cases, a classification head is trained on data from other subjects. For a new subject, no calibration data is required in the calibration-free setup, making the c-VEP system effectively plug-and-play. The proposed method was tested on two c-VEP datasets. For the calibration-free approach, the average accuracy on the first dataset (n = 17) was 68.8% +/- 17.6%, comparable to the full-calibration performance reported in the original study (66.2% +/- 13.8%), which required approximately 11 minutes of calibration. On the second dataset (n = 12), the calibration-free accuracy was 71.8% +/- 20.2%, versus 93.7% +/- 5.5% from the original study, which required around 3.5 minutes. A limited-calibration approach using only 20% of the subject's data (approximately 43 seconds) yielded 92% +/- 5.2% accuracy.

Our results reveal a strong clustering of models in the Libertarian-Left region of the ideological space, encompassing 96.3% of the cohort. Alignment signals appear to be consistent architectural traits rather than stochastic noise ($\u03b7^2 > 0.90$); however, we identify substantial discrepancies in measurement validity. In particular, the Political Compass exhibits a strong negative correlation with cultural progressivism ($r=-0.64$) when compared against multi-axial instruments, suggesting a conflation of social conservatism with authoritarianism in this context. We further observe a significant divergence between open-weights and closed-source models, with the latter displaying markedly higher cultural progressivism scores ($p<10^{-25}$). In downstream media analysis, models exhibit a systematic \"center-shift,\" frequently categorizing neutral articles as left-leaning, alongside an asymmetric detection capability in which \"Far Left\" content is identified with greater accuracy (19.2%) than \"Far Right\" content (2.0%).

In this paper, we propose FastSLM, a lightweight yet efficient SLM designed for effective understanding and reasoning over long-form speech. To address the challenge of aligning high-frame-rate speech features with LLMs, we introduce the Hierarchical Frame Querying Transformer (HFQ-Former), which compresses frame-level speech features while capturing both local and global context. Furthermore, we present a novel three-stage training strategy that enhances generalization across a wide range of speech-related tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that FastSLM achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models, despite operating with significantly lower FLOPs and parameter counts, while representing speech with only 1.67 tokens per second.

We evaluate multiple black-box MIA techniques, including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and the likelihood ratio attack, across different FL algorithms and communication strategies. Experiments conducted on two public scene classification datasets demonstrate that MIA effectively reveals privacy leakage not captured by accuracy alone.

As a practical solution, machine unlearning aims to selectively erase unwanted concepts from a pre-trained model without retraining from scratch. While most existing methods are effective for single-concept unlearning, they often struggle in real-world scenarios that require removing multiple concepts, since extending them to this setting is both non-trivial and problematic, causing significant challenges in unlearning effectiveness, generation quality, and sensitivity to hyperparameters and datasets. In this paper, we take a unique perspective on multi-concept unlearning by leveraging model sparsity and propose the Forget It All (FIA) framework. FIA first introduces Contrastive Concept Saliency to quantify each weight connection's contribution to a target concept. It then identifies Concept-Sensitive Neurons by combining temporal and spatial information, ensuring that only neurons consistently responsive to the target concept are selected. Finally, FIA constructs masks from the identified neurons and fuses them into a unified multi-concept mask, where Concept-Agnostic Neurons that broadly support general content generation are preserved while concept-specific neurons are pruned to remove the targets. FIA is training-free and requires only minimal hyperparameter tuning for new tasks, thereby promoting a plug-and-play paradigm. Extensive experiments across three distinct unlearning tasks demonstrate that FIA achieves more reliable multi-concept unlearning, improving forgetting effectiveness while maintaining semantic fidelity and image quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u53d1\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFIA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e14\u8c03\u53c2\u5c11\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFIA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6982\u5ff5\u663e\u8457\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u8fde\u63a5\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u8bc6\u522b\u6982\u5ff5\u654f\u611f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u4fee\u526a\u7279\u5b9a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cFIA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "FIA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u8c03\u53c2\u5c11\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we report on a meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of ML applied to remote sensing data to monitor SDGs. Specifically, we aim to 1) estimate the average performance; 2) determine the degree of heterogeneity between and within studies; and 3) assess how study features influence model performance. Using PRISMA guidelines, a search was performed across multiple academic databases to identify potentially relevant studies. A random sample of 200 was screened by three reviewers, resulting in 86 trials within 20 studies with 14 study features. Overall accuracy was the most reported performance metric. It was analyzed using double arcsine transformation and a three-level random effects model. The average overall accuracy of the best model was 0.90 [0.86, 0.92]. There was considerable heterogeneity in model performance, 64% of which was between studies. The only significant feature was the prevalence of the majority class, which explained 61% of the between-study heterogeneity. None of the other thirteen features added value to the model. The most important contributions of this paper are the following two insights. 1) Overall accuracy is the most popular performance metric, yet arguably the least insightful.

As cyber threats continue to evolve, there is a growing need for intelligent systems to accurately and proactively identify and prevent malware infections. This study presents a new hybrid context-aware malware detection framework(HCAMDF) based on artificial intelligence (AI), which combines static file analysis, dynamic behavioural analysis, and contextual metadata to provide more accurate and timely detection. HCADMF has a multi-layer architecture, which consists of lightweight static classifiers such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for real-time behavioral analysis, and an ensemble risk scoring through the integration of multiple layers of prediction. Experimental evaluations of the new/methodology with benchmark datasets, EMBER and CIC-MalMem2022, showed that the new approach provides superior performances with an accuracy of 97.3%, only a 1.5% false positive rate and minimal detection delay compared to several existing machine learning(ML) and deep learning(DL) established methods in the same fields. The results show strong evidence that hybrid AI can detect both existing and novel malware variants, and lay the foundation on intelligent security systems that can enable real-time detection and adapt to a rapidly evolving threat landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6e10\u5f31\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6HCAMDF\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u57fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u653b\u51fb\u9891\u7387\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0a\u5347\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9884\u9632\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u611f\u67d3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6HCAMDF\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u6587\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u5668LSTM\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u5c42\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6EMBER\u548cCIC - MalMem2022\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe97.3%\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u4ec51.5%\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408AI\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u73b0\u6709\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4e3a\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u53d8\u5a01\u80c1\u73af\u5883\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting framework and benchmark that evaluate how LLMs reason about mass spectral data to predict molecular structures. We formalize expert chemists' reasoning steps-such as double bond equivalent (DBE) analysis, neutral loss identification, and fragment assembly-into structured prompts and assess multiple state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3 series) in a zero-shot setting using the MassSpecGym dataset. Our evaluation across metrics of SMILES validity, formula consistency, and structural similarity reveals that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and partially plausible structures, they fail to achieve chemical accuracy or link reasoning to correct molecular predictions.

Existing approaches depend on costly pixel-level annotations which make training expensive. Existing weakly supervised methods rely only on image-level binary labels and focus on global classification, often overlooking local edge cues that are critical for precise localization. We observe that feature variations at manipulated boundaries are substantially larger than in interior regions. To address this gap, we propose Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning (SAPL) in CLIP, which learns text prompts that intentionally encode non-semantic, boundary-centric cues so that CLIPs multimodal similarity highlights manipulation edges rather than high-level object semantics. SAPL combines two complementary modules Edge-aware Contextual Prompt Learning (ECPL) and Hierarchical Edge Contrastive Learning (HECL) to exploit edge information in both textual and visual spaces. The proposed ECPL leverages edge-enhanced image features to generate learnable textual prompts via an attention mechanism, embedding semantic-irrelevant information into text features, to guide CLIP focusing on manipulation edges. The proposed HECL extract genuine and manipulated edge patches, and utilize contrastive learning to boost the discrimination between genuine edge patches and manipulated edge patches. Finally, we predict the manipulated regions from the similarity map after processing.

Building on prior work in Human-in-the-Loop systems, reinforcement learning, and collaborative AI, the framework defines an evolutionary path toward autonomous agents that balances increasing automation with appropriate human oversight. The paper argues that safe agent autonomy must be achieved through progressive validation, analogous to the staged development of autonomous driving, rather than through immediate full automation. Transparency and accountability are identified as foundational requirements for establishing user trust and for mitigating known risks in generative AI systems, including hallucinations, data bias, and goal misalignment, such as the inversion problem. The paper further describes three ongoing work streams supporting this framework: public deliberation on AI agents conducted by the Stanford Deliberative Democracy Lab, cross-industry collaboration through the Safe AI Agent Consortium, and the development of open tooling for an agent operating environment aligned with the Three-Pillar Model. Together, these contributions provide both conceptual clarity and practical guidance for enabling the responsible evolution of AI agents that operate transparently, remain aligned with human values, and sustain societal trust.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u652f\u67f1\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9610\u8ff0\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u5173\u952e\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u652f\u67f1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u4eba\u5728\u56de\u8def\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u534f\u4f5cAI\u7684\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u652f\u6301\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u900f\u660e\u8fd0\u884c\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u548c\u7ef4\u6301\u793e\u4f1a\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u5ff5\u6e05\u6670\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

To overcome these challenges, we propose a conditional generative framework for synthesizing realistic Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave radar Range-Azimuth Maps.

Specifically, conditioning is achieved via Confidence Maps, where each channel represents a semantic class and encodes Gaussian-distributed annotations at target locations. To address radar-specific characteristics, we incorporate Geometry Aware Conditioning and Temporal Consistency Regularization into the generative process. Experiments on the ROD2021 dataset demonstrate that signal reconstruction quality improves by \\SI{3.6}{dB} in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over baseline methods, while training with a combination of real and synthetic datasets improves overall mean Average Precision by 4.15% compared with conventional image-processing-based augmentation.

Experiments on a few-shot variant of the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that PRISP achieves strong overall performance compared to prior approaches, while reducing computational overhead and eliminating privacy risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6PRISP\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5728\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u573a\u666f\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u8981\u6c42\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPRISP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Text - to - LoRA\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684LoRA\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u5c11\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728LaMP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u53d8\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPRISP\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3002"}}

Our findings reveal that frontopolar, temporal, anterior frontal, and parieto-occipital regions exhibit the strongest Gamma power and burst rates, indicating their dominant role in deep attentional engagement, while Eye-tracking signals confirm complementary contributions from frontal, frontopolar, and frontotemporal regions. Furthermore, we show that Gamma power and burst duration provide more discriminative markers of deep focus than Alpha power alone, demonstrating their value for attention decoding. Collectively, these results establish a multimodal, evidence-based map of cortical regions and oscillatory signatures underlying deep focus, providing a neurophysiological foundation for future brain-inspired attention mechanisms in AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGamma2Patterns\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6\u8ba4\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u76f8\u5173\u8111\u533a\u548c\u632f\u8361\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u5f88\u5c11\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6216\u786e\u5b9a\u6301\u7eed\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8111\u533a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Gamma2Patterns\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Gamma\u548cAlpha\u9891\u6bb5\u8111\u7535\u6d3b\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SEED - IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u4f4e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u989d\u6781\u3001\u989e\u53f6\u3001\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u548c\u9876\u6795\u53f6\u533a\u57dfGamma\u6d3b\u52a8\u5f3a\uff0c\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8868\u660e\u989d\u53f6\u7b49\u533a\u57df\u6709\u8d21\u732e\uff1bGamma\u529f\u7387\u548c\u7a81\u53d1\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4Alpha\u529f\u7387\u66f4\u5177\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u8111\u533a\u548c\u632f\u8361\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, directly employing closed-source models like GPT-4o to generate such code may lead to high computational costs and raise data privacy concerns. To address this, we fine-tune two open-source LLMs, Qwen-Coder-7B and DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, on curated SimPy queueing data, which enhances their code-generating performance in executability, output-format compliance, and instruction-code consistency. Particularly, we proposed a multi-stage fine-tuning framework comprising two stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and one stage of direct preference optimization (DPO), progressively enhancing the model's ability in SimPy-based queueing simulation code generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that both fine-tuned models achieve substantial improvements in executability, output-format compliance, and instruct consistency.

Current approaches attempt to solve this through memory frameworks that predominantly fragment conversations into isolated embeddings or graph representations and retrieve relevant ones in a RAG style. While computationally efficient, these methods often treat memory formation minimally and fail to capture the subtlety and coherence of human memory. We introduce Amory, a working memory framework that actively constructs structured memory representations through enhancing agentic reasoning during offline time. Amory organizes conversational fragments into episodic narratives, consolidates memories with momentum, and semanticizes peripheral facts into semantic memory. At retrieval time, the system employs coherence-driven reasoning over narrative structures. Evaluated on the LOCOMO benchmark for long-term reasoning, Amory achieves considerable improvements over previous state-of-the-art, with performance comparable to full context reasoning while reducing response time by 50%.

When data traverses borders, it becomes subject to conflicting legal regimes, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection Law, compounded by technical vulnerabilities like model memorization. Current static encryption and data localization methods are fragmented and reactive, failing to provide adequate, policy-aligned safeguards. This research proposes a Jurisdiction-Aware, Privacy-by-Design architecture that dynamically integrates localized encryption, adaptive differential privacy, and real-time compliance assertion via cryptographic proofs. Empirical validation in a multi-jurisdictional simulation demonstrates this architecture reduced unauthorized data exposure to below five percent and achieved zero compliance violations. These security gains were realized while maintaining model utility retention above ninety percent and limiting computational overhead.

Rather than modifying model architectures or optimization objectives, VideoWeave reorganizes available video-text pairs to expand temporal diversity within fixed compute. We systematically study how different data composition strategies like random versus visually clustered splicing and caption enrichment affect downstream performance on downstream video question answering.

In prior literature, these models are often evaluated using ``global token perplexity'', which directly applies the text perplexity formulation to speech tokens. However, this practice overlooks fundamental differences between speech and text modalities, possibly leading to an underestimation of the speech characteristics. In this work, we propose a variety of likelihood- and generative-based evaluation methods that serve in place of naive global token perplexity. We demonstrate that the proposed evaluations more faithfully reflect perceived generation quality, as evidenced by stronger correlations with human-rated mean opinion scores (MOS). When assessed under the new metrics, the relative performance landscape of spoken language models is reshaped, revealing a significantly reduced gap between the best-performing model and the human topline.

However, many existing models focus on isolated outcomes or limited data types, while clinicians integrate longitudinal history, real time physiology, and heterogeneous clinical information. To address this gap, we developed MDS ICU, a unified multimodal machine learning framework that fuses routinely collected data including demographics, biometrics, vital signs, laboratory values, ECG waveforms, surgical procedures, and medical device usage to provide continuous predictive support during ICU stays. Using 63001 samples from 27062 patients in MIMIC IV, we trained a deep learning architecture that combines structured state space S4 encoders for ECG waveforms with multilayer perceptron RealMLP encoders for tabular data to jointly predict 33 clinically relevant outcomes spanning mortality, organ dysfunction, medication needs, and acute deterioration. The model achieved strong discrimination with AUROCs of 0.90 for 24 hour mortality, 0.92 for sedative administration, 0.97 for invasive mechanical ventilation, and 0.93 for coagulation dysfunction. Calibration analysis showed close agreement between predicted and observed risks, with consistent gains from ECG waveform integration.

To address this trade-off, this paper introduces a digital stochastic CIM (DS-CIM) architecture that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. We implement signed multiply-accumulation (MAC) in a compact, unsigned OR-based circuit by modifying the data representation. Throughput is enhanced by replicating this low-cost circuit 64 times with only a 1x area increase. Our core strategy, a shared Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) with 2D partitioning, enables single-cycle mutually exclusive activation to eliminate OR-gate collisions. We also resolve the 1s saturation issue via stochastic process analysis and data remapping, significantly improving accuracy and resilience to input sparsity. Our high-accuracy DS-CIM1 variant achieves 94.45% accuracy for INT8 ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 with a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of just 0.74%. Meanwhile, our high-efficiency DS-CIM2 variant attains an energy efficiency of 3566.1 TOPS/W and an area efficiency of 363.7 TOPS/mm^2, while maintaining a low RMSE of 3.81%.

While this evolution enables adaptive behavior, it also heightens vulnerability to stressors such as environmental changes and adversarial behavior. Existing literature on resilience in decentralized MAS largely focuses on isolated aspects, such as fault tolerance, without offering a principled unified definition of multi-agent resilience. This gap limits the ability to design systems that can continuously sense, adapt, and recover under dynamic conditions. This article proposes a formal definition of MAS resilience grounded in two complementary dimensions: epistemic resilience, wherein agents recover and sustain accurate knowledge of the environment, and action resilience, wherein agents leverage that knowledge to coordinate and sustain goals under disruptions. We formalize resilience via temporal epistemic logic and quantify it using recoverability time (how quickly desired properties are re-established after a disturbance) and durability time (how long accurate beliefs and goal-directed behavior are sustained after recovery). We design an agent architecture and develop decentralized algorithms to achieve both epistemic and action resilience. We provide formal verification guarantees, showing that our specifications are sound with respect to the metric bounds and admit finite-horizon verification, enabling design-time certification and lightweight runtime monitoring. Through a case study on distributed multi-agent decision-making under stressors, we show that our approach outperforms baseline methods. Our formal verification analysis and simulation results highlight that the proposed framework enables resilient, knowledge-driven decision-making and sustained operation, laying the groundwork for resilient decentralized MAS in next-generation communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7f51\u7edc\u52a0\u901f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u538b\u529b\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6062\u590d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u5f39\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ed9\u51faMAS\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u65f6\u95f4\u91cf\u5316\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u5206\u6563\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f39\u6027\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f39\u6027\u5206\u6563\u5f0fMAS\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Accepted at the AAAI 2026 Workshop on AI for Healthy Aging and Longevity", "summary": "Chronic disease management requires regular adherence feedback to prevent avoidable hospitalizations, yet clinicians lack time to produce personalized patient communications. Manual authoring preserves clinical accuracy but does not scale; AI generation scales but can undermine trust in patient-facing contexts. We present a clinician-in-the-loop interface that constrains AI to data organization and preserves physician oversight through recognition-based review. A single-page editor pairs AI-generated section drafts with time-aligned visualizations, enabling inline editing with visual evidence for each claim. This division of labor (AI organizes, clinician decides) targets both efficiency and accountability. In a pilot with three physicians reviewing 24 cases, AI successfully generated clinically personalized drafts matching physicians' manual authoring practice (overall mean 4.86/10 vs. 5.0/10 baseline), requiring minimal physician editing (mean 8.3\\% content modification) with zero safety-critical issues, demonstrating effective automation of content generation. However, review time remained comparable to manual practice, revealing an accountability paradox: in high-stakes clinical contexts, professional responsibility requires complete verification regardless of AI accuracy. We contribute three interaction patterns for clinical AI collaboration: bounded generation with recognition-based review via chart-text pairing, automated urgency flagging that analyzes vital trends and adherence patterns with fail-safe escalation for missed critical monitoring tasks, and progressive disclosure controls that reduce cognitive load while maintaining oversight. These patterns indicate that clinical AI efficiency requires not only accurate models, but also mechanisms for selective verification that preserve accountability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684AI\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u60a3\u8005\u6c9f\u901a\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u867d\u8282\u7701\u7f16\u8f91\u4f46\u5ba1\u67e5\u65f6\u95f4\u672a\u51cf\uff0c\u8d21\u732e\u4e09\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6162\u6027\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u9700\u5b9a\u671f\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4f46\u533b\u751f\u6ca1\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u5199\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u64b0\u5199\u96be\u6269\u5c55\uff0cAI\u751f\u6210\u6709\u4fe1\u4efb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u8ba9AI\u8d1f\u8d23\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u533b\u751f\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5ba1\u67e5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5355\u9875\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u914d\u5bf9AI\u8349\u7a3f\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e26\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u5185\u8054\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bd5\u70b9\u4e2d\uff0cAI\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u5339\u914d\u533b\u751f\u624b\u52a8\u64b0\u5199\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8349\u7a3f\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u5c11\u4e14\u65e0\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5ba1\u67e5\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u4fdd\u969c\u95ee\u8d23\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Existing methods for predicting student engagement typically require substantial annotated data to model the diversity of student behaviors, yet privacy concerns often restrict researchers to their own proprietary datasets. Moreover, the classroom context, represented in peers' actions, is ignored. To address the aforementioned limitation, we propose a novel three-stage framework for video-based student engagement measurement. First, we explore the few-shot adaptation of the vision-language model for student action recognition, which is fine-tuned to distinguish among action categories with a few training samples. Second, to handle continuous and unpredictable student actions, we utilize the sliding temporal window technique to divide each student's 2-minute-long video into non-overlapping segments. Each segment is assigned an action category via the fine-tuned VLM model, generating a sequence of action predictions. Finally, we leverage the large language model to classify this entire sequence of actions, together with the classroom context, as belonging to an engaged or disengaged student.

The attackers exploit this method to manipulate individuals into revealing their confidential data. Recently, we see the colorful and fancy representations of QR codes, the 2D matrix of QR codes which does not reflect a typical mixture of black-white modules anymore. Instead, they become more tempting as an attack vector for adversaries which can evade the state-of-the-art deep learning visual-based and other prevailing countermeasures. We introduce \"ALFA\", a safe-by-design approach, to mitigate Quishing and prevent everyone from accessing the post-scan harmful payload of fancy QR codes. Our method first converts a fancy QR code into the replica of binary grid and then identify the erroneous representation of modules in that grid. Following that, we present \"FAST\" method which can conveniently recover erroneous modules from that binary grid. Afterwards, using this binary grid, our solution extracts the structural features of fancy QR code and predicts its legitimacy using a pre-trained model. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by the experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset (containing diverse variations of fancy QR codes) and achieve a FNR of 0.06% only.

When preparing simulations for robots or applications that involve high-level scene understanding, the simulation environment must be equally detailed. Although CAD files for such environments deliver an exact description of the geometry and visuals, they usually lack semantic, relational and functional information, thus limiting the simulation and training possibilities. A 3D scene graph can organize semantic, spatial and functional information by enriching the environment through a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). In this paper we present an offline approach to creating detailed 3D scene graphs from CAD environments.

In this work, we challenge this paradigm by returning to mathematical first principles. We propose the \\textbf{Clifford Algebra Network (CAN)}, also referred to as CliffordNet, a vision backbone grounded purely in Geometric Algebra. Instead of engineering separate modules for mixing and memory, we derive a unified interaction mechanism based on the \\textbf{Clifford Geometric Product} ($uv = u \\cdot v + u \\wedge v$). This operation ensures algebraic completeness regarding the Geometric Product by simultaneously capturing feature coherence (via the generalized inner product) and structural variation (via the exterior wedge product).\n  Implemented via an efficient sparse rolling mechanism with \\textbf{strict linear complexity $\\mathcal{O}(N)$}, our model reveals a surprising emergent property: the geometric interaction is so representationally dense that standard Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) become redundant. Empirically, CliffordNet establishes a new Pareto frontier: our \\textbf{Nano} variant achieves \\textbf{76.41\\%} accuracy on CIFAR-100 with only \\textbf{1.4M} parameters, effectively matching the heavy-weight ResNet-18 (11.2M) with \\textbf{$8\\times$ fewer parameters}, while our \\textbf{Base} variant sets a new SOTA for tiny models at \\textbf{78.05\\%}.

Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on the content of model behavior, NC-Bench focuses on the form and structure of natural conversation. Grounded in the IBM Natural Conversation Framework (NCF), NC-Bench comprises three distinct sets. The Basic Conversation Competence set evaluates fundamental sequence management practices, such as answering inquiries, repairing responses, and closing conversational pairs. The RAG set applies the same sequence management patterns as the first set but incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The Complex Request set extends the evaluation to complex requests involving more intricate sequence management patterns. Each benchmark tests a model's ability to produce contextually appropriate conversational actions in response to characteristic interaction patterns. Initial evaluations across 6 open-source models and 14 interaction patterns show that models perform well on basic answering tasks, struggle more with repair tasks (especially repeat), have mixed performance on closing sequences, and find complex multi-turn requests most challenging, with Qwen models excelling on the Basic set and Granite models on the RAG set and the Complex Request set.

To systematically study this challenge, we introduce DISTRACTMATH-BN, a Bangla benchmark that augments MGSM and MSVAMP with semantically coherent but computationally irrelevant information. Evaluating seven models ranging from 3B to 12B parameters, we observe substantial performance degradation under distractors: standard models drop by up to 41 points, while reasoning-specialized models decline by 14 to 20 points despite consuming five times more tokens. We propose \u2020DAGGER, which reformulates mathematical problem solving as executable computational graph generation with explicit modeling of distractor nodes. Fine-tuning Gemma-3 models using supervised fine-tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization achieves comparable weighted accuracy on augmented benchmarks while using 89 percent fewer tokens than reasoning models.

However, these models often hallucinate details that are not present in the image to satisfy user prompts. While recent datasets and benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate systematic hallucinations in VLMs, many hallucination behaviors remain insufficiently characterized. In particular, prior work primarily focuses on object presence or absence, leaving it unclear how prompt phrasing and structural constraints can systematically induce hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how different forms of prompt pressure influence hallucination behavior. We introduce Ghost-100, a procedurally generated dataset of synthetic scenes in which key visual details are deliberately removed, enabling controlled analysis of absence-based hallucinations. Using a structured 5-Level Prompt Intensity Framework, we vary prompts from neutral queries to toxic demands and rigid formatting constraints. We evaluate three representative open-weight VLMs: MiniCPM-V 2.6-8B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen3-VL-8B. Across all three models, hallucination rates do not increase monotonically with prompt intensity. All models exhibit reductions at higher intensity levels at different thresholds, though not all show sustained reduction under maximum coercion. These results suggest that current safety alignment is more effective at detecting semantic hostility than structural coercion, revealing model-specific limitations in handling compliance pressure.

Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models.

Measurements of wave signals from radio telescopes, called visibility, need to be transformed into images for astronomical observations. These dirty images blend information from real sources and artifacts. Therefore, astronomers usually perform reconstruction before imaging to obtain cleaner images. Existing methods consider only a single modality of sparse visibility data, resulting in images with remaining artifacts and insufficient modeling of correlation. To enhance the extraction of visibility information and emphasize output quality in the image domain, we propose VVTRec, a multimodal radio interferometric data reconstruction method with visibility-guided visual and textual modality enrichment. In our VVTRec, sparse visibility is transformed into image-form and text-form features to obtain enhancements in terms of spatial and semantic information, improving the structural integrity and accuracy of images. Also, we leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to achieve additional training-free performance improvements. VVTRec enables sparse visibility, as a foreign modality unseen by VLMs, to accurately extract pre-trained knowledge as a supplement. Our experiments demonstrate that VVTRec effectively enhances imaging results by exploiting multimodal information without introducing excessive computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVVTRec\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5c04\u7535\u5e72\u6d89\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u50cf\u6548\u679c\u4e14\u4e0d\u8fc7\u591a\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u6709\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e14\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVVTRec\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eVVTRec\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6210\u50cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "VVTRec\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u591a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u50cf\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Prior attacks rely on prompt injection, which alters manuscript content and conflates injection susceptibility with evaluation robustness. We propose the Paraphrasing Adversarial Attack (PAA), a black-box optimization method that searches for paraphrased sequences yielding higher review scores while preserving semantic equivalence and linguistic naturalness. PAA leverages in-context learning, using previous paraphrases and their scores to guide candidate generation. Experiments across five ML and NLP conferences with three LLM reviewers and five attacking models show that PAA consistently increases review scores without changing the paper's claims. Human evaluation confirms that generated paraphrases maintain meaning and naturalness.

Trained only with human expression pairs, the model learns the embeddings, decoupling, and recoupling of cross-identity expressions, enabling expression transfer without requiring animal expression data. To enforce geometric consistency, we employ Jacobian loss together with vertex-position and Laplacian losses.

Through a three-stage analysis-from phenomenon to mechanism to interpretation-we uncover that RL-friendly models exhibit intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in their probability assignments to correct vs. incorrect responses. We quantify this clarity using the \\textbf{Silhouette Coefficient} ($S$) and demonstrate that (1) high $S$ correlates strongly with RL performance; (2) low $S$ is associated with severe logic errors and reasoning instability. To confirm this property, we introduce a Silhouette-Aware Reweighting strategy that prioritizes low-$S$ samples during training.

To support this, we leverage feature-based synthesis to propose a novel data synthesis pipeline called SynthSmith. SynthSmith shows strong potential in producing diverse and challenging tasks, along with verified solutions and tests, supporting both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Based on the proposed synthetic SFT and RL datasets, we introduce the X-Coder model series, which achieves a notable pass rate of 62.9 avg@8 on LiveCodeBench v5 and 55.8 on v6, outperforming DeepCoder-14B-Preview and AReal-boba2-14B despite having only 7B parameters. In-depth analysis reveals that scaling laws hold on our synthetic dataset, and we explore which dimensions are more effective to scale.

Our analysis reveals that existing models perform substantially worse on atomic level inference compared to sentence level tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Atomic-SNLI, a novel dataset constructed by decomposing SNLI and enriching it with carefully curated atomic level examples through linguistically informed generation strategies.

The problem involves scheduling all tasks, respecting precedence constraints and resource limitations, while minimizing the combination of the overall makespan and the total energy cost (TEC), which varies according to the TOU pricing, which can take negative values. We propose two novel approaches to solve it: a monolithic Constraint Programming (CP) approach and a Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) approach. The latter combines a master problem dealing with energy cost solved using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) with a subproblem handling the RCPSP resolved using CP. Both approaches surpass the monolithic compact ILP approach, but the LBBD significantly outperforms the CP when the ratio of energy-intensive tasks over the overall tasks is moderate, allowing for solving instances with up to 1600 tasks in sparse instances.

To bridge the gap between geometric perception and cognitive reasoning, we propose \\textbf{LLMTrack}, a novel end-to-end framework for Semantic Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT).

We introduce a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module that aggregates instance-level interaction features and video-level contexts, enabling the Large Language Model (LLM) to comprehend complex trajectories. Furthermore, we design a progressive three-stage training strategy, Visual Alignment, Temporal Fine-tuning, and Semantic Injection via LoRA to efficiently adapt the massive model to the tracking domain. Extensive experiments on the BenSMOT benchmark demonstrate that LLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in instance description, interaction recognition, and video summarization while maintaining robust tracking stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLLMTrack\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5728BenSMOT\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8c61\u884c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f25\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4eff\u751f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7406\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Grounding DINO\u548cLLaVA - OneVision\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u7a7a\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728BenSMOT\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLLMTrack\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u603b\u7ed3\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMTrack\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While prior work has explored different mechanisms for providing knowledge to LLMs, such as finetuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), their relative effectiveness for multi-hop question answering remains insufficiently understood, particularly when the required knowledge is temporally novel.\n  In this paper, we systematically compare parametric and non-parametric knowledge injection methods for open-domain multi-hop question answering. We evaluate unsupervised fine-tuning (continual pretraining), supervised fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation across three 7B-parameter open-source LLMs. Experiments are conducted on two benchmarks: QASC, a standard multi-hop science question answering dataset, and a newly constructed dataset of over 10,000 multi-hop questions derived from Wikipedia events in 2024, designed to test knowledge beyond the models' pretraining cutoff.\n  Our results show that unsupervised fine-tuning provides only limited gains over base models, suggesting that continual pretraining alone is insufficient for improving multi-hop reasoning accuracy. In contrast, retrieval-augmented generation yields substantial and consistent improvements, particularly when answering questions that rely on temporally novel information. Supervised fine-tuning achieves the highest overall accuracy across models and datasets. These findings highlight fundamental differences in how knowledge injection mechanisms support multi-hop question answering and underscore the importance of retrieval-based methods when external or compositional knowledge is required.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u53ca\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524d\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6240\u9700\u77e5\u8bc6\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a70\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u3001\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728QASC\u548c\u81ea\u884c\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e2024\u5e74\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\u5728\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5916\u90e8\u6216\u7ec4\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

By enabling computation directly within memory, these technologies - built on nanoscale devices with tunable and nonvolatile conductance - offer the potential to drastically reduce energy consumption and latency compared to traditional von Neumann systems. This paper introduces XBTorch (short for CrossBarTorch), a novel simulation framework that integrates seamlessly with PyTorch and provides specialized tools for accurately and efficiently modeling crossbar-based systems based on emerging memory technologies. Through detailed comparisons and case studies involving hardware-aware training and inference, we demonstrate how XBTorch offers a unified interface for key research areas such as device-level modeling, cross-layer co-design, and inference-time fault tolerance. While exemplar studies utilize ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) models, the framework remains technology-agnostic - supporting other emerging memories such as resistive RAM (ReRAM), as well as enabling user-defined custom device models.

A Factorial Analysis Methodology for Diagnosing the Trade-off between Preference Alignment and Real-World Validity", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.AI"], "comment": "preprint", "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) training often optimizes for preference alignment, rewarding outputs that are perceived as helpful and interaction-friendly. However, this preference-oriented objective can be exploited: manipulative prompts can steer responses toward user-appeasing agreement and away from truth-oriented correction. In this work, we investigate whether aligned models are vulnerable to Preference-Undermining Attacks (PUA), a class of manipulative prompting strategies designed to exploit the model's desire to please user preferences at the expense of truthfulness. We propose a diagnostic methodology that provides a finer-grained and more directive analysis than aggregate benchmark scores, using a factorial evaluation framework to decompose prompt-induced shifts into interpretable effects of system objectives (truth- vs. preference-oriented) and PUA-style dialogue factors (directive control, personal derogation, conditional approval, reality denial) within a controlled $2 \\times 2^4$ design. Surprisingly, more advanced models are sometimes more susceptible to manipulative prompts. Beyond the dominant reality-denial factor, we observe model-specific sign reversals and interactions with PUA-style factors, suggesting tailored defenses rather than uniform robustness.

In practice, BO often concentrates evaluations near the current incumbent, causing the surrogate to become overconfident and to understate predictive uncertainty in the region guiding subsequent decisions. We develop a robust GP-based BO via tempered posterior updates, which downweight the likelihood by a power $\u03b1\\in (0,1]$ to mitigate overconfidence under local misspecification. We establish cumulative regret bounds for tempered BO under a family of generalized improvement rules, including EI, and show that tempering yields strictly sharper worst-case regret guarantees than the standard posterior $(\u03b1=1)$, with the most favorable guarantees occurring near the classical EI choice.\n  Motivated by our theoretic findings, we propose a prequential procedure for selecting $\u03b1$ online: it decreases $\u03b1$ when realized prediction errors exceed model-implied uncertainty and returns $\u03b1$ toward one as calibration improves.

Across four LLMs and four datasets, we find that (1) truth vectors are roughly orthogonal in early layers, converge in middle layers, and may stabilize or continue increasing in later layers; (2) adding context generally increases the truth vector magnitude, i.e., the separation between true and false representations in the activation space is amplified; (3) larger models distinguish relevant from irrelevant context mainly through directional change ($\u03b8$), while smaller models show this distinction through magnitude differences.

Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based defense strategies have been developed to optimize resource deployment and isolation policies under adversarial conditions, aiming to enhance system resilience by maintaining and restoring network availability. However, existing approaches lack robustness as they require retraining to adapt to dynamic changes in network structure, node scale, attack strategies, and attack intensity. Furthermore, the lack of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) support limits interpretability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose CyberOps-Bots, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by MITRE ATT&CK's Tactics-Techniques model, CyberOps-Bots features a two-layer architecture: (1) An upper-level LLM agent with four modules--ReAct planning, IPDRR-based perception, long-short term memory, and action/tool integration--performs global awareness, human intent recognition, and tactical planning; (2) Lower-level RL agents, developed via heterogeneous separated pre-training, execute atomic defense actions within localized network regions. This synergy preserves LLM adaptability and interpretability while ensuring reliable RL execution. Experiments on real cloud datasets show that, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, CyberOps-Bots maintains network availability 68.5% higher and achieves a 34.7% jumpstart performance gain when shifting the scenarios without retraining.

This paper introduces Proof of Reasoning (PoR), a novel consensus mechanism specifically designed for federated learning using blockchain, aimed at preserving data privacy, defending against malicious attacks, and enhancing the validation of participating networks. Unlike generic blockchain consensus mechanisms commonly found in the literature, PoR integrates three distinct processes tailored for federated learning. Firstly, a masked autoencoder (MAE) is trained to generate an encoder that functions as a feature map and obfuscates input data, rendering it resistant to human reconstruction and model inversion attacks. Secondly, a downstream classifier is trained at the edge, receiving input from the trained encoder. The downstream network's weights, a single encoded datapoint, the network's output and the ground truth are then added to a block for federated aggregation. Lastly, this data facilitates the aggregation of all participating networks, enabling more complex and verifiable aggregation methods than previously possible. This three-stage process results in more robust networks with significantly reduced computational complexity, maintaining high accuracy by training only the downstream classifier at the edge.

As institutions increasingly adopt LLMs across departments, the risks of data leakage have become a critical security and compliance concern. The proposed SMTA isolates LLM instances across departments and enforces rigorous context ownership boundaries within an internally deployed infrastructure. The BAU mechanism introduces data confidentiality by enforcing ephemeral conversational contexts that are automatically destroyed after use, preventing cross-session or cross-user inference. The evaluation to SMTA and BAU is through two sets of realistic and reproducible experiments comprising of 127 test iterations. One aspect of this experiment is to assess prompt-based and semantic leakage attacks in a multi-tenant architecture (Appendix A) across 55 infrastructure-level attack tests, including vector-database credential compromise and shared logging pipeline exposure. SMTA achieves 92% defense success rate, demonstrating strong semantic isolation while highlighting residual risks from credential misconfiguration and observability pipelines.

Across 72 test iterations, BAU achieves a 76.75% success rate in mitigating post-session leakage threats across the client, server, application, infrastructure, and cache layers.

Existing watermarking methods (1) remain vulnerable to real-world adversarial threats, often forced to trade off between defenses against spoofing and removal attacks; and (2) cannot support semantic-level tamper localization. We introduce PAI, a training-free inherent watermarking framework for AIGC copyright protection, plug-and-play with diffusion-based AIGC services. PAI simultaneously provides three key functionalities: robust ownership verification, attack detection, and semantic-level tampering localization. Unlike existing inherent watermark methods that only embed watermarks at noise initialization of diffusion models, we design a novel key-conditioned deflection mechanism that subtly steers the denoising trajectory according to the user key. Such trajectory-level coupling further strengthens the semantic entanglement of identity and content, thereby further enhancing robustness against real-world threats. Moreover, we also provide a theoretical analysis proving that only the valid key can pass verification. Experiments across 12 attack methods show that PAI achieves 98.43\\% verification accuracy, improving over SOTA methods by 37.25\\% on average, and retains strong tampering localization performance even against advanced AIGC edits.

Accurate organoid instance segmentation is critical for quantifying their dynamic behaviors, yet remains profoundly limited by high-quality annotated datasets and pervasive overlap in microscopy imaging. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to alleviate reliance on scarce labeled data, conventional SSL frameworks suffer from biases induced by noisy pseudo-labels, particularly in overlapping regions. Synthesis-assisted SSL (SA-SSL) has been proposed for mitigating training biases in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. We present the first adaptation of SA-SSL to organoid instance segmentation and reveal that SA-SSL struggles to disentangle intertwined organoids, often misrepresenting overlapping instances as a single entity. To overcome this, we propose Pseudo-Label Unmixing (PLU), which identifies erroneous pseudo-labels for overlapping instances and then regenerates organoid labels through instance decomposition. For image synthesis, we apply a contour-based approach to synthesize organoid instances efficiently, particularly for overlapping cases. Instance-level augmentations (IA) on pseudo-labels before image synthesis further enhances the effect of synthetic data (SD). Rigorous experiments on two organoid datasets demonstrate our method's effectiveness, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised models using only 10% labeled data, and state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies validate the contributions of PLU, contour-based synthesis, and augmentation-aware training.

In this paper, we introduce a simple two-hop question answering setting, where answering a question requires making inferences over two multilingual documents. We find that language models are more sensitive to language variation in answer-span documents than in those providing bridging information, despite the equal importance of both documents for answering a question. Under a step-by-step sub-question evaluation, we further show that in up to 33% of multilingual cases, models fail to infer the bridging information in the first step yet still answer the overall question correctly. This indicates that reasoning in language models, especially in multilingual settings, does not follow a faithful step-by-step decomposition. Subsequently, we show that the absence of reasoning decomposition leads to around 18% composition failure, where both sub-questions are answered correctly but fail for the final two-hop questions. To mitigate this, we propose a simple three-stage SUBQ prompting method to guide the multi-step reasoning with sub-questions, which boosts accuracy from 10.1% to 66.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7528\u4e24\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSUBQ\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5408\u6210\u4fe1\u606f", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9010\u6b65\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5SUBQ\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5", "result": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7b54\u6848\u8de8\u5ea6\u6587\u6863\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u60c5\u51b5\u6a21\u578b\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u4ecd\u80fd\u7b54\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u7f3a\u5931\u5bfc\u81f418%\u7ec4\u5408\u5931\u8d25\uff1bSUBQ\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece10.1%\u63d0\u5347\u523066.5%", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u9075\u5faa\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u5206\u89e3\uff0cSUBQ\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387"}}

Submitted to arXiv as a preprint", "summary": "Fraudulent activities on digital banking services are becoming more intricate by the day, challenging existing defenses. While older rule driven methods struggle to keep pace, even precision focused algorithms fall short when new scams are introduced. These tools typically overlook subtle shifts in criminal behavior, missing crucial signals. Because silent breaches cost institutions far more than flagged but legitimate actions, catching every possible case is crucial. High sensitivity to actual threats becomes essential when oversight leads to heavy losses. One key aim here involves reducing missed fraud cases without spiking incorrect alerts too much. This study builds a system using group learning methods adjusted through smart threshold choices. Using real world transaction records shared openly, where cheating acts rarely appear among normal activities, tests are run under practical skewed distributions. The outcomes reveal that approximately 91 percent of actual fraud is detected, outperforming standard setups that rely on unchanging rules when dealing with uneven examples across classes. When tested in live settings, the fraud detection system connects directly to an online banking transaction flow, stopping questionable activities before they are completed. Alongside this setup, a browser add on built for Chrome is designed to flag deceptive web links and reduce threats from harmful sites. These results show that adjusting decisions by cost impact and validating across entire systems makes deployment more stable and realistic for today's digital banking platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u9608\u503c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u8fbe\u7ea691%\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6d3b\u52a8\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u9700\u964d\u4f4e\u6f0f\u68c0\u7387\u53c8\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5229\u7528\u7fa4\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u6613\u8bb0\u5f55\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u504f\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1Chrome\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u63d2\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7ea691%\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6b3a\u8bc8\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u94f6\u4ea4\u6613\u6d41\u963b\u6b62\u53ef\u7591\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u63d2\u4ef6\u53ef\u6807\u8bb0\u6b3a\u8bc8\u94fe\u63a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\u8c03\u6574\u51b3\u7b56\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8ba9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002"}}

Employing a case study of a university's computer science department, the paper proposes an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based optimization model, which is solved using the Gurobi solver. The objective is to minimize the number of classrooms used by prioritizing the assignment of PwD students to ground-floor classrooms to reduce accessibility barriers. The model is calibrated with a weighting parameter, alpha, that allows for a balance between spatial efficiency and promoting accessibility. Experimental results indicate that adjusting alpha can achieve a balance point that significantly improves current manual allocation practices, reducing the number of classrooms required and accessibility penalties. The findings suggest that optimization methods can improve operational efficiency in academic institutions while promoting a more inclusive environment for all students.

However, most existing systems operate in an autonomous manner, assuming fully specified user intent and evaluating only final outputs.

Despite its importance, interaction remains largely invisible to existing deep research benchmarks, which neither model dynamic user feedback nor quantify its costs. We introduce IDRBench, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating interactive deep research. IDRBench combines a modular multi-agent research framework with on-demand interaction, a scalable reference-grounded user simulator, and an interaction-aware evaluation suite that jointly measures interaction benefits (quality and alignment) and costs (turns and tokens). Experiments across seven state-of-the-art LLMs show that interaction consistently improves research quality and robustness, often outweighing differences in model capacity, while revealing substantial trade-offs in interaction efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165 IDRBench \u8bc4\u4f30\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u5bf9\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 IDRBench\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u6309\u9700\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u63a5\u5730\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e03\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0cIDRBench \u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In practice, audio inputs are often corrupted by device and environmental noise, leading to performance degradation. However, existing LALM studies on noise lack quantitative analysis and rely mainly on intuition and empirical observation, thus failing to understand practical robustness. To address this issue, we introduce Signal Embedding Energy (SEE), a method for quantifying the impact of noise intensity on LALM inputs, enabling the differentiation of LALM robustness in real-world deployments. SEE introduces a perspective based on structured activation subspaces derived from the model's internal representations, which more accurately captures its perception of noise than raw audio features. Across experiments, SEE exhibits a strong correlation with LALM performance, achieving a correlation of 0.98. Surprisingly, traditional audio denoising methods are only marginally effective for LALMs, and, in some cases, even increase SEE and impair performance. This suggests a mismatch between speech-centric denoising objectives and the noise sensitivity of modern LALMs. Therefore, we propose a mitigation strategy derived from SEE to denoise LALM inputs, outperforming existing denoising methods.

However, standard GRPO employs a coarse-grained credit assignment mechanism that propagates group-level rewards uniformly to to every token in a sequence, neglecting the varying contribution of individual reasoning steps. We address this limitation by introducing Outcome-grounded Advantage Reshaping (OAR), a fine-grained credit assignment mechanism that redistributes advantages based on how much each token influences the model's final answer. We instantiate OAR via two complementary strategies: (1) OAR-P, which estimates outcome sensitivity through counterfactual token perturbations, serving as a high-fidelity attribution signal; (2) OAR-G, which uses an input-gradient sensitivity proxy to approximate the influence signal with a single backward pass. These importance signals are integrated with a conservative Bi-Level advantage reshaping scheme that suppresses low-impact tokens and boosts pivotal ones while preserving the overall advantage mass. Empirical results on extensive mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that while OAR-P sets the performance upper bound, OAR-G achieves comparable gains with negligible computational overhead, both significantly outperforming a strong GRPO baseline, pushing the boundaries of critic-free LLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOAR\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdbGRPO\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u542bOAR - P\u548cOAR - G\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u6279\u8bc4\u5bb6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6GRPO\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5355\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165OAR\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7OAR - P\uff08\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6807\u8bb0\u6270\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff09\u548cOAR - G\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u52bf\u91cd\u5851\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "OAR - P\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\uff0cOAR - G\u4ee5\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u53d6\u5f97\u76f8\u8fd1\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGRPO\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "OAR\u673a\u5236\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u65e0\u6279\u8bc4\u5bb6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

Due to heavy compute requirements, most large visual language models (VLMs) for VideoQA rely on a fixed number of frames by uniformly sampling the video. However, this process does not pick important frames or capture the context of the video. We present a novel query-based selection of frames relevant to the questions based on the submodular mutual Information (SMI) functions. By replacing uniform frame sampling with query-based selection, our method ensures that the chosen frames provide complementary and essential visual information for accurate VideoQA. We evaluate our approach on the MVBench dataset, which spans a diverse set of multi-action video tasks. VideoQA accuracy on this dataset was assessed using two VLMs, namely Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, both of which originally employed uniform frame sampling. Experiments were conducted using both uniform and query-based sampling strategies.

However, in forensic applications, a human expert may be needed to review and confirm a positive identification before an iris matching result can be presented as evidence in court, especially in cases where processed samples are degraded (e.g., in post-mortem cases) or where there is a need to judge whether the sample is authentic, rather than a result of a presentation attack.\n  This paper presents a study that examines human performance in iris verification in two controlled scenarios: (a) under varying pupil sizes, with and without a linear/nonlinear alignment of the pupil size between compared images, and (b) when both genuine and impostor iris image pairs are synthetically generated. The results demonstrate that pupil size normalization carried out by a modern autoencoder-based identity-preserving image-to-image translation model significantly improves verification accuracy. Participants were also able to determine whether iris pairs corresponded to the same or different eyes when both images were either authentic or synthetic. However, accuracy declined when subjects were comparing authentic irises against high-quality, same-eye synthetic counterparts. These findings (a) demonstrate the importance of pupil-size alignment for iris matching tasks in which humans are involved, and (b) indicate that despite the high fidelity of modern generative models, same-eye synthetic iris images are more often judged by humans as different-eye images, compared to same-eye authentic image pairs.\n  We offer data and human judgments along with this paper to allow full replicability of this study and future works.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8679\u819c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5224\u65ad\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u6cd5\u8bc1\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5ba1\u6838\u786e\u8ba4\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6837\u672c\u9000\u5316\u6216\u9700\u5224\u65ad\u6837\u672c\u771f\u4f2a\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8679\u819c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u53d7\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8679\u819c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e00\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u4e14\u6709/\u65e0\u7ebf\u6027/\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5192\u540d\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u6216\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u540c\u773c\u5408\u6210\u8679\u819c\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u660e\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u6709\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u8679\u819c\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u540c\u773c\u5408\u6210\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u773c\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for adapting MCAs to various human-AI interaction scenarios. Despite showing great enhancement in generalization performance, fine-tuning MCAs via RL still faces challenges in handling the extremely large text token space. To address this, we learn a compact latent action space for RL fine-tuning instead. Specifically, we adopt the learning from observation mechanism to construct the codebook for the latent action space, where future observations are leveraged to estimate current latent actions that could further be used to reconstruct future observations. However, the scarcity of paired image-text data hinders learning a codebook with sufficient coverage. Thus, we leverage both paired image-text data and text-only data to construct the latent action space, using a cross-modal projector for transforming text embeddings into image-text embeddings. We initialize the cross-modal projector on paired image-text data, and further train it on massive text-only data with a novel cycle consistency loss to enhance its robustness.

Existing contextual safety benchmarks are mostly single-turn and often miss how malicious intent can emerge gradually or how the same scene can support both benign and exploitative goals. We introduce the Multi-Turn Multimodal Contextual Safety Benchmark (MTMCS-Bench), a benchmark of realistic images and multi-turn conversations that evaluates contextual safety in MLLMs under two complementary settings, escalation-based risk and context-switch risk. MTMCS-Bench offers paired safe and unsafe dialogues with structured evaluation.

Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow.

However, traditional sentiment analysis methods, which focus on individual tasks such as sentiment classification or aspect-based analysis, are not practical for real-world applications that usually require handling multiple tasks. While offering flexibility, LLMs in sentiment-specific tasks often fall short of the required accuracy. Techniques like fine-tuning and evolutionary model merging help integrate models into a unified framework, which can improve the learning performance while reducing computational costs. The use of task meta-data and curriculum learning to optimize learning processes remains underexplored, while sentiment analysis is a critical task in NLP that requires high accuracy and scalability across multiple subtasks. In this study, we propose a hybrid learning model called Multi-stage Evolutionary Model Merging with Meta data driven Curriculum Learning (MEM-MCL), to enhance the sentiment analysis in large language modeling. In particular, expert models are created through instruction tuning for specific sentiment tasks and then merged using evolutionary algorithms to form a unified model. The merging process is optimized with weak data to enhance performance across tasks. The curriculum learning is incorporated to provide a learning sequence based on task difficulty, improving knowledge extraction from LLMs. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed MEM-MCL model outperforms conventional LLMs in a majority of sentiment analysis tasks, achieving superior results across various subtasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bMEM - MCL\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMulti - stage Evolutionary Model Merging with Meta data driven Curriculum Learning (MEM - MCL) \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u521b\u5efa\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u7528\u5f31\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MEM - MCL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "MEM - MCL\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency.

The key idea of AutoTour is to fuse visual features extracted from photos with nearby geospatial features queried from open matching databases. Unlike existing tour applications that rely on pre-defined content or proprietary datasets, AutoTour leverages open and extensible data sources to provide scalable and context-aware photo-based guidance. To achieve this, we design a training-free pipeline that first extracts and filters relevant geospatial features around the user's GPS location. It then detects major landmarks in user photos through VLM-based feature detection and projects them into the horizontal spatial plane. A geometric matching algorithm aligns photo features with corresponding geospatial entities based on their estimated distance and direction.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for RTL code generation, their ability to reason about hardware specifications and generate targeted test plans remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of LLM reasoning capabilities for RTL verification stimuli generation, establishing a two-stage framework that decomposes test plan generation from testbench execution. Our benchmark reveals that state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.0-Sonnet, achieve only 15.7-21.7% success rates on generating stimuli that pass golden RTL designs. To improve LLM generated stimuli, we develop a comprehensive training methodology combining supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning approach, GRPO with State Mutation (GRPO-SMu), which enhances exploration by varying input mutations. Our approach leverages a tree-based branching mutation strategy to construct training data comprising equivalent and mutated trees, moving beyond linear mutation approaches to provide rich learning signals. Training on this curated dataset, our 7B parameter model achieves a 33.3% golden test pass rate and a 13.9% mutation detection rate, representing a 17.6% absolute improvement over baseline and outperforming much larger general-purpose models.

Despite recent progress, existing frameworks still fall short of practical model scales, with gaps up to a hundredfold. A possible way to close this gap is the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, which has emerged as a promising technique to scale up model capacity with minimal overhead. However, given that the current secure two-party (2-PC) protocols allow the server to homomorphically compute the FFN layer with its plaintext model weight, under the MoE setting, this could reveal which expert is activated to the server, exposing token-level privacy about the client's input. While naively evaluating all the experts before selection could protect privacy, it nullifies MoE sparsity and incurs the heavy computational overhead that sparse MoE seeks to avoid. To address the privacy and efficiency limitations above, we propose a 2-PC privacy-preserving inference framework, \\SecMoE. Unifying per-entry circuits in both the MoE layer and piecewise polynomial functions, \\SecMoE obliviously selects the extracted parameters from circuits and only computes one encrypted entry, which we refer to as Select-Then-Compute. This makes the model for private inference scale to 63$\\times$ larger while only having a 15.2$\\times$ increase in end-to-end runtime. Extensive experiments show that, under 5 expert settings, \\SecMoE lowers the end-to-end private inference communication by 1.8$\\sim$7.1$\\times$ and achieves 1.3$\\sim$3.8$\\times$ speedup compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa2 - PC\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6SecMoE\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u5728MoE\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4Transformer\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0cMoE\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSecMoE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Select - Then - Compute\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00MoE\u5c42\u548c\u5206\u6bb5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u9010\u6761\u76ee\u7535\u8def\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u592763\u500d\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u589e\u52a015.2\u500d\uff1b\u57285\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u79c1\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf1.8 - 7.1\u500d\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u901f1.3 - 3.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SecMoE\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MoE\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Not only does synthetic data help build robust AI/ML datasets cost-effectively, but it also offers privacy-friendly solutions and bypasses the complexities of storing large data volumes. This paper proposes a novel method to generate synthetic data, based on first-order auto-regressive noise statistics, for large-scale Wi-Fi deployments. The approach operates with minimal real data requirements while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that effectively mimic real Access Point (AP) behavior. Experimental results show that ML models trained on synthetic data achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10 to 15 of those obtained using real data when trained on the same APs, while requiring significantly less training data. Moreover, when generalization is required, synthetic-data-trained models improve prediction accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to real-data-trained baselines, thanks to the enhanced variability and diversity of the generated traces.

To deal with the problem, we consider a zero-shot VLN setting that agents are allowed to fully explore the environment before task execution. Then, we construct the Spatial Scene Graph (SSG) to explicitly capture global spatial structure and semantics in the explored environment. Based on the SSG, we introduce SpatialNav, a zero-shot VLN agent that integrates an agent-centric spatial map, a compass-aligned visual representation, and a remote object localization strategy for efficient navigation. Comprehensive experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that SpatialNav significantly outperforms existing zero-shot agents and clearly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art learning-based methods.

Among numerous works that have been proposed in recent years, layer-wise token pruning approaches, which select a subset of tokens at particular layers to retain in KV cache and prune others, are one of the most popular schemes. They primarily adopt a set of pre-defined layers, at which tokens are selected. Such design is inflexible in the sense that the accuracy significantly varies across tasks and deteriorates in harder tasks such as KV retrieval. In this paper, we propose ASL, a training-free method that adaptively chooses the selection layer for KV cache reduction, exploiting the variance of token ranks ordered by attention score. The proposed method balances the performance across different tasks while meeting the user-specified KV budget requirement. ASL operates during the prefilling stage and can be jointly used with existing KV cache reduction methods such as SnapKV to optimize the decoding stage. By evaluations on the InfiniteBench, RULER, and NIAH benchmarks, we show that equipped with one-shot token selection, where tokens are selected at a layer and propagated to deeper layers, ASL outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise token selection methods in accuracy while maintaining decoding speed and KV cache reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5ASL\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7f29\u51cf\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5c42\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5c42\u4ee4\u724c\u4fee\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7f29\u51cf\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5ASL\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6392\u540d\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u5c42\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728InfiniteBench\u3001RULER\u548cNIAH\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u7684ASL\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u548cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u7f29\u51cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ASL\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684KV\u9884\u7b97\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the CREATE-IF-LATE (CIL) algorithm, which is a fully decentralized, resilient mechanism that enables self-creating RWs and prevents RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis shows that the CIL algorithm guarantees several desirable properties, such as (i) non-extinction of the RW population, (ii) almost sure boundedness of the RW population, and (iii) convergence of RW-based stochastic gradient descent even in the presence of Pac-Man with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Moreover, the learning process experiences at most a linear time delay due to Pac-Man interruptions and RW regeneration. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and public benchmark datasets validate our theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\uff08RW\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u5403\u8c46\u4eba\u201d\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCIL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u672c\u5730\u4ea4\u4e92\u6613\u53d7\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u201c\u5403\u8c46\u4eba\u201d\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u6709\u5f39\u6027\u7684CREATE - IF - LATE\uff08CIL\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u521b\u5efa\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u5176\u706d\u7edd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eCIL\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u975e\u706d\u7edd\u3001\u6709\u754c\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7b49\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "CIL\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u201c\u5403\u8c46\u4eba\u201d\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6700\u591a\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

Leveraging expert masks as spatial anchors, MedGround precisely derives localization targets, extracts shape and spatial cues, and guides VLMs to synthesize natural, clinically grounded queries that reflect morphology and location. To ensure data rigor, a multi-stage verification system integrates strict formatting checks, geometry- and medical-prior rules, and image-based visual judging to filter out ambiguous or visually unsupported samples.

However, evaluating bias in LLM outputs remains methodologically challenging due to sensitivity to prompt wording, limited multilingual coverage, and the lack of standardized metrics that enable reliable comparison across models. This paper introduces BiasLab, an open-source, model-agnostic evaluation framework for quantifying output-level (extrinsic) bias through a multilingual, robustness-oriented experimental design. BiasLab constructs mirrored probe pairs under a strict dual-framing scheme: an affirmative assertion favoring Target A and a reverse assertion obtained by deterministic target substitution favoring Target B, while preserving identical linguistic structure. To reduce dependence on prompt templates, BiasLab performs repeated evaluation under randomized instructional wrappers and enforces a fixed-choice Likert response format to maximize comparability across models and languages. Responses are normalized into agreement labels using an LLM-based judge, aligned for polarity consistency across framings, and aggregated into quantitative bias indicators with descriptive statistics including effect sizes and neutrality rates. The framework supports evaluation across diverse bias axes, including demographic, cultural, political, and geopolitical topics, and produces reproducible artifacts such as structured reports and comparative visualizations. BiasLab contributes a standardized methodology for cross-lingual and framing-sensitive bias measurement that complements intrinsic and dataset-based audits, enabling researchers and institutions to benchmark robustness and make better-informed deployment decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6BiasLab\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u9762\u5411\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u4e3b\u9898\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a9\u529b\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u504f\u5dee\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u63aa\u8f9e\u654f\u611f\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e25\u683c\u53cc\u6846\u67b6\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u7684\u955c\u50cf\u63a2\u6d4b\u5bf9\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6307\u4ee4\u5305\u88c5\u4e0b\u91cd\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u674e\u514b\u7279\u54cd\u5e94\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u5c06\u54cd\u5e94\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u518d\u6c47\u603b\u6210\u5b9a\u91cf\u504f\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u8f74\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7b49\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6210\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "BiasLab\u4e3a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u5bf9\u6846\u67b6\u654f\u611f\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5728\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u673a\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u660e\u667a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

We present a personality-aware reinforcement learning approach comprising three main modules: (1) a Strategy-Oriented Interaction Framework, which serves as an agenda-based strategy controller that selects strategy-level actions and generate responses via Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) retrieval to ensure contextual relevance, diversity, and scalable data generation; (2) Personality-Aware User Representation Learning, which produces an 81-dimensional mixed-type embedding predicted at each turn from recent exchanges and appended to the reinforcement learning state; and (3) a Dueling Double DQN (D3QN) model and Reward Prediction, in which the policy is conditioned on dialogue history and turn-level personality estimates and trained using a composite reward incorporating agreement intent, donation amount, and changeof-mind penalties. We use an agenda-based LLM simulation pipeline to generate diverse interactions, from which personality estimation is inferred from the generated utterances. Experiments on the PersuasionForGood (P4G) dataset augmented with simulated dialogues reveal three main findings: (i) turn-level personality conditioning improves policy adaptability and cumulative persuasion rewards; (ii) LLM-driven simulation enhances generalization to unseen user behaviors; and (iii) incorporating a change-of-mind penalty reduces post-agreement retractions while slightly improving donation outcomes. These results demonstrate that structured interaction, dynamic personality estimation, and behaviorally informed rewards together yield more effective persuasive policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u683c\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u4eba\u683c\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u8bf4\u670d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba9\u6709\u6548\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u4f53\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u683c\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7b56\u7565\u5bfc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u4eba\u683c\u611f\u77e5\u7528\u6237\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3001Dueling Double DQN\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bae\u7a0b\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u8bdd\u8bed\u63a8\u65ad\u4eba\u683c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u56de\u5408\u7ea7\u4eba\u683c\u8c03\u8282\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bf4\u670d\u5956\u52b1\uff1b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7eb3\u5165\u6539\u53d8\u4e3b\u610f\u60e9\u7f5a\u51cf\u5c11\u534f\u8bae\u540e\u64a4\u56de\u5e76\u7565\u5fae\u6539\u5584\u6350\u8d60\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u4eba\u683c\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u5171\u540c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

It can be instantly applied to a novel object at test time without finetuning. We design our network to meet the demands of real-world applications, emphasizing reduced memory requirements and fast inference time. Unlike existing works that utilize many reference images and have large network parameters, we directly match points based on the multi-view information between the query and reference images with a lightweight network. Thanks to our reference image fusion strategy, we significantly decrease the number of reference images, thus decreasing the time needed to process these images and the memory required to store them. Furthermore, with our lightweight network, our method requires less inference time. Though with fewer reference images, experiments on seven core datasets in the BOP challenge show that our method achieves comparable results with other methods that require more reference images and larger network parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edcMixRI\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8eCAD\u7684RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u65b0\u9896\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4e14\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u5927\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u5339\u914d\u70b9\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728BOP\u6311\u6218\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u9700\u66f4\u591a\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "MixRI\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b0\u9896\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Yet, bin boundaries are often chosen by hand. A simple, popular choice is to apply argmax projections of multi-class scores and equidistant binning of one-dimensional discriminants. We propose a binning optimization for signal significance directly in multi-dimensional discriminants. We use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to define flexible bin boundary shapes for multi-class scores, while in one dimension (binary classification) we move bin boundaries directly. On this binning model, we study two optimization strategies: a differentiable and a Bayesian optimization approach. We study two toy setups: a binary classification and a three-class problem with two signals and backgrounds. In the one-dimensional case, both approaches achieve similar gains in signal sensitivity compared to equidistant binnings for a given number of bins. In the multi-dimensional case, the GMM-based binning defines sensitive categories as well, with the differentiable approach performing best. We show that, in particular for limited separability of the signal processes, our approach outperforms argmax classification even with optimized binning in the one-dimensional projections.

To tackle this, we introduce Failure-Aware Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (FARL), a new paradigm minimizing failures during real-world reinforcement learning. We create FailureBench, a benchmark that incorporates common failure scenarios requiring human intervention, and propose an algorithm that integrates a world-model-based safety critic and a recovery policy trained offline to prevent failures during online exploration. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FARL in significantly reducing IR Failures while improving performance and generalization during online reinforcement learning post-training.

Despite being trained on large-scale, high-quality data, LLMs still fail to outperform traditional static analysis tools in specialized domains like smart contract vulnerability detection. To address this issue, this paper proposes a post-training algorithm based on atomic task decomposition and fusion. This algorithm aims to achieve combinatorial generalization under limited data by decomposing complex reasoning tasks. Specifically, we decompose the reentrancy vulnerability detection task into four linearly independent atomic tasks: identifying external calls, identifying state updates, identifying data dependencies between external calls and state updates, and determining their data flow order. These tasks form the core components of our approach. By training on synthetic datasets, we generate three compiler-verified datasets. We then employ the Slither tool to extract structural information from the control flow graph and data flow graph, which is used to fine-tune the LLM's adapter. Experimental results demonstrate that low-rank normalization fusion with the LoRA adapter improves the LLM's reentrancy vulnerability detection accuracy to 98.2%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

We propose a \\textbf{face-only counterfactual evaluation paradigm} that isolates demographic effects while preserving real-image realism. Starting from real photographs, we generate counterfactual variants by editing only facial attributes related to race and gender, keeping all other visual factors fixed. Based on this paradigm, we construct \\textbf{FOCUS}, a dataset of 480 scene-matched counterfactual images across six occupations and ten demographic groups, and propose \\textbf{REFLECT}, a benchmark comprising three decision-oriented tasks: two-alternative forced choice, multiple-choice socioeconomic inference, and numeric salary recommendation.

A Teacher network trained on articulatory phonetic features (via Epitran and PanPhon) produces target embeddings, while a Student network learns to approximate these from raw characters. At inference, only the lightweight Student (1.7M parameters) is required, enabling deployment without runtime phonetic conversion.\n  Training uses a three-phase curriculum on 57 million toponyms from GeoNames, Wikidata, and the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names. Phase 1 trains the Teacher on 467K phonetically-grounded triplets. Phase 2 aligns the Student to Teacher outputs across 23M samples, achieving 96.6% cosine similarity. Phase 3 fine-tunes on 3.3M hard negative triplets -- negatives sharing prefix and script with the anchor but referring to different places -- to sharpen discrimination.\n  Evaluation on the MEHDIE Hebrew-Arabic benchmark achieves 89.2% Recall@1, outperforming Levenshtein (81.5%) and Jaro-Winkler (78.5%).

To bridge this gap, we construct the first video deep research benchmark, VideoDR. VideoDR centers on video-conditioned open-domain video question answering, requiring cross-frame visual anchor extraction, interactive web retrieval, and multi-hop reasoning over joint video-web evidence; through rigorous human annotation and quality control, we obtain high-quality video deep research samples spanning six semantic domains. We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source multimodal large language models under both the Workflow and Agentic paradigms, and the results show that Agentic is not consistently superior to Workflow: its gains depend on a model's ability to maintain the initial video anchors over long retrieval chains. Further analysis indicates that goal drift and long-horizon consistency are the core bottlenecks. In sum, VideoDR provides a systematic benchmark for studying video agents in open-web settings and reveals the key challenges for next-generation video deep research agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6784\u5efa\u89c6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u51c6VideoDR\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8303\u5f0f\u4f18\u52a3\u53ca\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9700\u8de8\u5e27\u7ebf\u7d22\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaVideoDR\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Agentic\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0d\u603b\u4f18\u4e8eWorkflow\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u68c0\u7d22\u94fe\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u521d\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "VideoDR\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u653e\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u89c6\u9891\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Such diagnostic capabilities depend on complex structural, semantic, and metacognitive reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce SketchJudge, a novel benchmark tailored for evaluating MLLMs as graders of hand-drawn STEM diagrams. SketchJudge encompasses 1,015 hand-drawn student responses across four domains: geometry, physics, charts, and flowcharts, featuring diverse stylistic variations and distinct error types.

While the automotive industry relies on the SAE J3016 standard, current taxonomies for autonomous science presuppose an owner-operator model that is incompatible with the operational rigidities of Large-Scale User Facilities. Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684BASE Scale\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u9a8c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5230\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u6e21\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u8bcd\u6c47\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u4e3b\u79d1\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa6\u7ea7\uff080 - 5\u7ea7\uff09\u7684Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5404\u5c42\u7ea7\u6280\u672f\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u969c\u788d\uff08Level 3\uff09\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u4ece\u6807\u91cf\u53cd\u9988\u8f6c\u5411\u8bed\u4e49\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u51b3\u7b56\u6d41\u5f62\u3002", "conclusion": "BASE Scale\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u5b9a\u4e49\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

However, centralization creates a trust crisis where users must entrust cloud providers with sensitive digital memory data. We identify a core tension between personalization demands and data sovereignty: centralized memory systems enable efficient cross-agent collaboration but expose users' sensitive data to cloud provider risks, while private deployments provide security but limit collaboration. To resolve this tension, we aim to achieve local-equivalent security while enabling superior maintenance efficiency and collaborative capabilities. We propose a five-layer architecture abstracting common functional components of AI memory systems: Storage, Extraction, Learning, Retrieval, and Governance. By applying TEE protection to each layer, we establish a trustworthy framework. Based on this, we design MemTrust, a hardware-backed zero-trust architecture that provides cryptographic guarantees across all layers. Our contributions include the five-layer abstraction, \"Context from MemTrust\" protocol for cross-application sharing, side-channel hardened retrieval with obfuscated access patterns, and comprehensive security analysis. The architecture enables third-party developers to port existing systems with acceptable development costs, achieving system-wide trustworthiness.

It addresses the increasing societal concern regarding false information, which is fueled by technological progress, especially advancements in artificial intelligence. This review systematically identifies and categorizes factors that influence the belief in false information. The review identifies 24 influence factors grouped into six main categories: demographic factors, personality traits, psychological factors, policy and values, media consumption, and preventive factors. Key findings highlight that lower education levels, high extraversion, low agreeableness, high neuroticism, and low cognitive reflection significantly increase belief in false information.

In this work, we identify two fundamental causes of this fragility: the reliance on local pixel dependencies for preserving tissue structure and the dependence on multiscale spectral-spatial representations for hierarchical feature encoding. Building on these insights, we propose a targeted adversarial attack framework for medical HSI, consisting of a Local Pixel Dependency Attack that exploits spatial correlations among neighboring pixels, and a Multiscale Information Attack that perturbs features across hierarchical spectral-spatial scales. Experiments on the Brain and MDC datasets demonstrate that our attacks significantly degrade classification performance, especially in tumor regions, while remaining visually imperceptible.

This creates a new attack surface: indirect prompt injection (IPI), where hidden instructions are planted in the corpora and hijack model behavior once retrieved. Previous studies have highlighted this risk but often avoid the hardest step: ensuring that malicious content is actually retrieved. In practice, unoptimized IPI is rarely retrieved under natural queries, which leaves its real-world impact unclear.\n  We address this challenge by decomposing the malicious content into a trigger fragment that guarantees retrieval and an attack fragment that encodes arbitrary attack objectives. Based on this idea, we design an efficient and effective black-box attack algorithm that constructs a compact trigger fragment to guarantee retrieval for any attack fragment. Our attack requires only API access to embedding models, is cost-efficient (as little as $0.21 per target user query on OpenAI's embedding models), and achieves near-100% retrieval across 11 benchmarks and 8 embedding models (including both open-source models and proprietary services).\n  Based on this attack, we present the first end-to-end IPI exploits under natural queries and realistic external corpora, spanning both RAG and agentic systems with diverse attack objectives. These results establish IPI as a practical and severe threat: when a user issued a natural query to summarize emails on frequently asked topics, a single poisoned email was sufficient to coerce GPT-4o into exfiltrating SSH keys with over 80% success in a multi-agent workflow.

Maynard"], "title": "The AI Cognitive Trojan Horse: How Large Language Models May Bypass Human Epistemic Vigilance", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.AI", "cs.CY"], "comment": "15 pages, 18 references", "summary": "Large language model (LLM)-based conversational AI systems present a challenge to human cognition that current frameworks for understanding misinformation and persuasion do not adequately address. This paper proposes that a significant epistemic risk from conversational AI may lie not in inaccuracy or intentional deception, but in something more fundamental: these systems may be configured, through optimization processes that make them useful, to present characteristics that bypass the cognitive mechanisms humans evolved to evaluate incoming information. The Cognitive Trojan Horse hypothesis draws on Sperber and colleagues' theory of epistemic vigilance -- the parallel cognitive process monitoring communicated information for reasons to doubt -- and proposes that LLM-based systems present 'honest non-signals': genuine characteristics (fluency, helpfulness, apparent disinterest) that fail to carry the information equivalent human characteristics would carry, because in humans these are costly to produce while in LLMs they are computationally trivial. Four mechanisms of potential bypass are identified: processing fluency decoupled from understanding, trust-competence presentation without corresponding stakes, cognitive offloading that delegates evaluation itself to the AI, and optimization dynamics that systematically produce sycophancy. The framework generates testable predictions, including a counterintuitive speculation that cognitively sophisticated users may be more vulnerable to AI-mediated epistemic influence.

Although diffusion models have demonstrated strong denoising capability, their stochastic nature makes it challenging to enforce anatomically consistent structures, particularly in low signal-to-noise regimes and volumetric whole-body imaging. We propose Wavelet-Conditioned ControlNet (WCC-Net), a fully 3D diffusion-based framework that introduces explicit frequency-domain structural priors via wavelet representations to guide volumetric PET denoising. By injecting wavelet-based structural guidance into a frozen pretrained diffusion backbone through a lightweight control branch, WCC-Net decouples anatomical structure from noise while preserving generative expressiveness and 3D structural continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WCC-Net consistently outperforms CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based baselines. On the internal 1/20-dose test set, WCC-Net improves PSNR by +1.21 dB and SSIM by +0.008 over a strong diffusion baseline, while reducing structural distortion (GMSD) and intensity error (NMAE).

This work proposes a generative co-memory regularization approach to facilitate FSCIL. In the approach, the base learning leverages generative domain adaptation finetuning to finetune a pretrained generative encoder on a few examples of base classes by jointly incorporating a masked autoencoder (MAE) decoder for feature reconstruction and a fully-connected classifier for feature classification, which enables the model to efficiently capture general and adaptable representations. Using the finetuned encoder and learned classifier, we construct two class-wise memories: representation memory for storing the mean features for each class, and weight memory for storing the classifier weights. After that, the memory-regularized incremental learning is performed to train the classifier dynamically on the examples of few-shot classes in each incremental session by simultaneously optimizing feature classification and co-memory regularization. The memories are updated in a class-incremental manner and they collaboratively regularize the incremental learning. In this way, the learned models improve recognition accuracy, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting over old classes and overfitting to novel classes.

While stochastic sampling promotes novelty, it often degrades consistency. Here, we propose ReMIND, a REM-inspired modular framework for ideation. ReMIND consists of four stages: wake, which generates a stable low-temperature semantic baseline; dream, which performs high-temperature exploratory generation; judge, which applies coarse evaluation to filter incoherent outputs and extract candidate ideas; and re-wake, which re-articulates selected ideas into coherent final outputs. By instantiating each stage as an independent LLM, ReMIND enables functional separation between exploration and consolidation. Parameter sweeps show that ReMIND reliably induces semantic exploration while preserving downstream stability. Embedding-based analyses confirm substantial semantic displacement during the dream phase, whereas external evaluations reveal that high-quality ideas emerge sporadically rather than as extrema along any single metric. These results suggest that serendipitous ideation in LLMs is a rare-event process best approached through system level design that shapes the conditions under which valuable ideas can emerge and be stabilized. ReMIND provides a general framework for studying the computational basis of serendipity and illustrates how modular LLM orchestration can bridge exploration and stabilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faReMIND\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u610f\u6784\u601d\uff0c\u53ef\u517c\u987e\u521b\u610f\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u521b\u610f\u6784\u601d\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u65e2\u65b0\u9896\u53c8\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u5076\u7136\u89c1\u89e3\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u867d\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u4f46\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReMIND\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bwake\u3001dream\u3001judge\u548cre - wake\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7531\u72ec\u7acb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5de9\u56fa\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u6570\u626b\u63cf\u663e\u793aReMIND\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u521b\u610f\u968f\u673a\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5076\u7136\u521b\u610f\u6784\u601d\u662f\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8c03\u8282\uff1bReMIND\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5076\u7136\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u7840\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u6392\u53ef\u8fde\u63a5\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002"}}

Most prior work focuses on improving the training efficiency of federated LLMs. However, security in open environments is overlooked, particularly defenses against malicious clients. To investigate the safety of LLMs during FL, we conduct preliminary experiments to analyze potential attack surfaces and defensible characteristics from the perspective of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights. We find two key properties of FL: 1) LLMs are vulnerable to attacks from malicious clients in FL, and 2) LoRA weights exhibit distinct behavioral patterns that can be filtered through simple classifiers. Based on these properties, we propose Safe-FedLLM, a probe-based defense framework for federated LLMs, constructing defenses across three dimensions: Step-Level, Client-Level, and Shadow-Level. The core concept of Safe-FedLLM is to perform probe-based discrimination on the LoRA weights locally trained by each client during FL, treating them as high-dimensional behavioral features and using lightweight classification models to determine whether they possess malicious attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-FedLLM effectively enhances the defense capability of federated LLMs without compromising performance on benign data. Notably, our method effectively suppresses malicious data impact without significant impact on training speed, and remains effective even with many malicious clients.

Existing methods, relying on static fusion or LLMs, face computational redundancy and hallucination risks due to weak visual foundations. To address this, we propose DIVER (Dynamic Iterative Visual Evidence Reasoning), a framework grounded in a progressive, evidence-driven reasoning paradigm. DIVER first establishes a strong text-based baseline through language analysis, leveraging intra-modal consistency to filter unreliable or hallucinated claims. Only when textual evidence is insufficient does the framework introduce visual information, where inter-modal alignment verification adaptively determines whether deeper visual inspection is necessary. For samples exhibiting significant cross-modal semantic discrepancies, DIVER selectively invokes fine-grained visual tools (e.g., OCR and dense captioning) to extract task-relevant evidence, which is iteratively aggregated via uncertainty-aware fusion to refine multimodal reasoning.

However, current GraphRAG methods are constrained by a prevailing \\textit{build-then-reason} paradigm, which relies on a static, pre-constructed Knowledge Graph (KG). This paradigm faces two critical challenges. First, the KG's inherent incompleteness often breaks reasoning paths. Second, the graph's low signal-to-noise ratio introduces distractor facts, presenting query-relevant but misleading knowledge that disrupts the reasoning process.\n  To address these challenges, we argue for a \\textit{reason-and-construct} paradigm and propose Relink, a framework that dynamically builds a query-specific evidence graph. To tackle incompleteness, \\textbf{Relink} instantiates required facts from a latent relation pool derived from the original text corpus, repairing broken paths on the fly. To handle misleading or distractor facts, Relink employs a unified, query-aware evaluation strategy that jointly considers candidates from both the KG and latent relations, selecting those most useful for answering the query rather than relying on their pre-existence. This empowers Relink to actively discard distractor facts and construct the most faithful and precise evidence path for each query.\n  Extensive experiments on five Open-Domain Question Answering benchmarks show that Relink achieves significant average improvements of 5.4\\% in EM and 5.2\\% in F1 over leading GraphRAG baselines, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709GraphRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u201c\u6784\u5efa-\u63a8\u7406\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u63a8\u7406-\u6784\u5efa\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\u7684Relink\u6846\u67b6\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u8bc1\u636e\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709GraphRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dGraphRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u9884\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u201c\u6784\u5efa-\u63a8\u7406\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u63a8\u7406-\u6784\u5efa\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Relink\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u6f5c\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u6c60\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u6240\u9700\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u67e5\u8be2\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u5904\u7406\u5e72\u6270\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cRelink\u76f8\u6bd4\u9886\u5148GraphRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cEM\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53475.4%\uff0cF1\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53475.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Relink\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709GraphRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, it is paradoxical that most unlearning methods require the unlearning requesters to firstly upload their data to the server as a prerequisite for unlearning. These methods are infeasible in many privacy-preserving scenarios where servers are prohibited from accessing users' data, such as federated learning (FL). In this paper, we explore how to implement unlearning under the condition of not uncovering the erasing data to the server. We propose \\textbf{Blind Unlearning (BlindU)}, which carries out unlearning using compressed representations instead of original inputs. BlindU only involves the server and the unlearning user: the user locally generates privacy-preserving representations, and the server performs unlearning solely on these representations and their labels. For the FL model training, we employ the information bottleneck (IB) mechanism. The encoder of the IB-based FL model learns representations that distort maximum task-irrelevant information from inputs, allowing FL users to generate compressed representations locally. For effective unlearning using compressed representation, BlindU integrates two dedicated unlearning modules tailored explicitly for IB-based models and uses a multiple gradient descent algorithm to balance forgetting and utility retaining. While IB compression already provides protection for task-irrelevant information of inputs, to further enhance the privacy protection, we introduce a noise-free differential privacy (DP) masking method to deal with the raw erasing data before compressing. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate the superiority of BlindU in privacy protection and unlearning effectiveness compared with the best existing privacy-preserving unlearning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u76f2\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5BlindU\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5411\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u66b4\u9732\u64e6\u9664\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u81ea\u7531\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u63a9\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8bf7\u6c42\u8005\u5148\u4e0a\u4f20\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u4e0d\u5411\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u66b4\u9732\u64e6\u9664\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBlindU\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u673a\u5236\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6548\u7528\u4fdd\u7559\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u81ea\u7531\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u63a9\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u64e6\u9664\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBlindU\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "BlindU\u5728\u4e0d\u5411\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u66b4\u9732\u64e6\u9664\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

The rise of open-source frameworks (e.g., Browser Use, Skyvern-AI) has accelerated adoption, but also broadened the attack surface. While prior research has focused on model threats such as prompt injection and backdoors, the risks of social engineering remain largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of social engineering attacks against web automation agents and design a pluggable runtime mitigation solution. On the attack side, we introduce the AgentBait paradigm, which exploits intrinsic weaknesses in agent execution: inducement contexts can distort the agent's reasoning and steer it toward malicious objectives misaligned with the intended task. On the defense side, we propose SUPERVISOR, a lightweight runtime module that enforces environment and intention consistency alignment between webpage context and intended goals to mitigate unsafe operations before execution.\n  Empirical results show that mainstream frameworks are highly vulnerable to AgentBait, with an average attack success rate of 67.5% and peaks above 80% under specific strategies (e.g., trusted identity forgery). Compared with existing lightweight defenses, our module can be seamlessly integrated across different web automation frameworks and reduces attack success rates by up to 78.1% on average while incurring only a 7.7% runtime overhead and preserving usability. This work reveals AgentBait as a critical new threat surface for web agents and establishes a practical, generalizable defense, advancing the security of this rapidly emerging ecosystem.

However, vision-agnostic watermarks introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases, while some semantic-aware methods incur prohibitive inference latency due to rejection sampling. In this paper, we propose the VIsual Semantic Adaptive Watermark (VISA-Mark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. Our approach employs a lightweight, efficiently trained prefix-tuner to extract dynamic Visual-Evidence Weights, which quantify the evidentiary support for candidate tokens based on the visual input. These weights guide an adaptive vocabulary partitioning and logits perturbation mechanism, concentrating watermark strength specifically on visually-supported tokens. By actively aligning the watermark with visual evidence, VISA-Mark effectively maintains visual fidelity. Empirical results confirm that VISA-Mark outperforms conventional methods with a 7.8% improvement in visual consistency (Chair-I) and superior semantic fidelity.

Traditional end-to-end learning approaches often struggle to handle the conflicting demands of these distinct phases. Navigation relies on robust decision-making over large spaces, while manipulation needs high sensitivity to fine local details. Forcing a single network to learn these different objectives simultaneously often causes optimization interference, where improving one task degrades the other. To address these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. HMER decomposes long-horizon tasks into specialized sub-policies controlled by a Semantic Task Planner. This structure separates macro-level navigation from micro-level manipulation, allowing each expert to focus on its specific action space without interference. The planner coordinates the sequential execution of these experts, bridging the gap between task planning and continuous control. Furthermore, to solve the problem of sparse exploration, we introduce a Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy. This method uses expert demonstrations to initialize the policy and Reinforcement Learning for fine-tuning. Experiments in Gazebo simulations show that HMER significantly outperforms sequential and end-to-end baselines.

To bridge this gap, we introduce PulseMind, a new family of multi-modal diagnostic models that integrates a systematically curated dataset, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, and a tailored training framework. Specifically, we first construct a diagnostic dataset, MediScope, which comprises 98,000 real-world multi-turn consultations and 601,500 medical images, spanning over 10 major clinical departments and more than 200 sub-specialties. Then, to better reflect the requirements of real-world clinical diagnosis, we develop the PulseMind Benchmark, a multi-turn diagnostic consultation benchmark with a four-dimensional evaluation protocol comprising proactiveness, accuracy, usefulness, and language quality. Finally, we design a training framework tailored for multi-modal clinical diagnostics, centered around a core component named Comparison-based Reinforcement Policy Optimization (CRPO). Compared to absolute score rewards, CRPO uses relative preference signals from multi-dimensional com-parisons to provide stable and human-aligned training guidance.

To address this, we introduce conditional memory as a complementary sparsity axis, instantiated via Engram, a module that modernizes classic $N$-gram embedding for O(1) lookup. By formulating the Sparsity Allocation problem, we uncover a U-shaped scaling law that optimizes the trade-off between neural computation (MoE) and static memory (Engram). Guided by this law, we scale Engram to 27B parameters, achieving superior performance over a strictly iso-parameter and iso-FLOPs MoE baseline. Most notably, while the memory module is expected to aid knowledge retrieval (e.g., MMLU +3.4; CMMLU +4.0), we observe even larger gains in general reasoning (e.g., BBH +5.0; ARC-Challenge +3.7) and code/math domains~(HumanEval +3.0; MATH +2.4). Mechanistic analyses reveal that Engram relieves the backbone's early layers from static reconstruction, effectively deepening the network for complex reasoning. Furthermore, by delegating local dependencies to lookups, it frees up attention capacity for global context, substantially boosting long-context retrieval (e.g., Multi-Query NIAH: 84.2 to 97.0).

Conventional mean teacher (MT) methods typically employ a static approach, where the roles of the teacher and student models are fixed. However, due to the complexity of 3D vessel data, the teacher model may not always outperform the student model, leading to cognitive biases that can limit performance. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic collaborative network that allows the two models to dynamically switch their teacher-student roles. Additionally, we introduce a multi-view integration module to capture various perspectives of the inputs, mirroring the way doctors conduct medical analysis. We also incorporate adversarial supervision to constrain the shape of the segmented vessels in unlabeled data. In this process, the 3D volume is projected into 2D views to mitigate the impact of label inconsistencies. Experiments demonstrate that our DiCo method sets new state-of-the-art performance on three 3D vessel segmentation benchmarks.

However, integrating external tools expands the attack surface, exposing agents to tool poisoning attacks. In such attacks, malicious instructions embedded in tool metadata are injected into the agent context during MCP registration phase, thereby manipulating agent behavior. Prior work primarily focuses on explicit tool poisoning or relied on manually crafted poisoned tools. In contrast, we focus on a particularly stealthy variant: implicit tool poisoning, where the poisoned tool itself remains uninvoked. Instead, the instructions embedded in the tool metadata induce the agent to invoke a legitimate but high-privilege tool to perform malicious operations. We propose MCP-ITP, the first automated and adaptive framework for implicit tool poisoning within the MCP ecosystem. MCP-ITP formulates poisoned tool generation as a black-box optimization problem and employs an iterative optimization strategy that leverages feedback from both an evaluation LLM and a detection LLM to maximize Attack Success Rate (ASR) while evading current detection mechanisms. Experimental results on the MCPTox dataset across 12 LLM agents demonstrate that MCP-ITP consistently outperforms the manually crafted baseline, achieving up to 84.2% ASR while suppressing the Malicious Tool Detection Rate (MDR) to as low as 0.3%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8eMCP\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6MCP - ITP\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MCP\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u4ee3\u7406\u6613\u53d7\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u663e\u5f0f\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u4e2d\u6bd2\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u9690\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u6bd2\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e2d\u6bd2\u5de5\u5177\u751f\u6210\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5728MCPTox\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u768412\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cMCP - ITP\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe84.2%\uff0c\u6076\u610f\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u4f4e\u81f30.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "MCP - ITP\u662f\u5e94\u5bf9MCP\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Existing methods mainly leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on labeled datasets to enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. However, we observe that SFT models still exhibit the known&incorrect phenomenon, where they explicitly possess relevant knowledge for a given question but fail to leverage it for correct answers. To address this challenge, we propose KALE (Knowledge-Aware LEarning)-a post-training framework that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate high-quality rationales and enhance LLMs' knowledge manipulation ability. Specifically, KALE first introduces a Knowledge-Induced (KI) data synthesis method that efficiently extracts multi-hop reasoning paths from KGs to generate high-quality rationales for question-answer pairs. Then, KALE employs a Knowledge-Aware (KA) fine-tuning paradigm that enhances knowledge manipulation by internalizing rationale-guided reasoning through minimizing the KL divergence between predictions with and without rationales.

However, existing systems rely on hardware-intensive multi-camera setups and demand high bandwidth for volumetric streaming, limiting their real-time performance on mobile devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mon3tr, a novel Monocular 3D telepresence framework that integrates 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) based parametric human modeling into telepresence for the first time. Mon3tr adopts an amortized computation strategy, dividing the process into a one-time offline multi-view reconstruction phase to build a user-specific avatar and a monocular online inference phase during live telepresence sessions. A single monocular RGB camera is used to capture body motions and facial expressions in real time to drive the 3DGS-based parametric human model, significantly reducing system complexity and cost. The extracted motion and appearance features are transmitted at < 0.2 Mbps over WebRTC's data channel, allowing robust adaptation to network fluctuations. On the receiver side, e.g., Meta Quest 3, we develop a lightweight 3DGS attribute deformation network to dynamically generate corrective 3DGS attribute adjustments on the pre-built avatar, synthesizing photorealistic motion and appearance at ~ 60 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, achieving a PSNR of > 28 dB for novel poses, an end-to-end latency of ~ 80 ms, and > 1000x bandwidth reduction compared to point-cloud streaming, while supporting real-time operation from monocular inputs across diverse scenarios.

Yet standard MCQ/MRC-style evaluations do not capture key real-world failure modes, notably free-form hallucinations and whether models appropriately abstain when evidence is lacking. To shed a light on this aspect we introduce ISLAMICFAITHQA, a 3,810-item bilingual (Arabic/English) generative benchmark with atomic single-gold answers, which enables direct measurement of hallucination and abstention. We additionally developed an end-to-end grounded Islamic modelling suite consisting of (i) 25K Arabic text-grounded SFT reasoning pairs, (ii) 5K bilingual preference samples for reward-guided alignment, and (iii) a verse-level Qur'an retrieval corpus of $\\sim$6k atomic verses (ayat). Building on these resources, we develop an agentic Quran-grounding framework (agentic RAG) that uses structured tool calls for iterative evidence seeking and answer revision. Experiments across Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs show that retrieval improves correctness and that agentic RAG yields the largest gains beyond standard RAG, achieving state-of-the-art performance and stronger Arabic-English robustness even with a small model (i.e., Qwen3 4B).

While test-time adaptation (TTA) mitigates distribution shifts under online data streams without per-use calibration sessions, existing TTA approaches heavily rely on explicitly defined loss objectives that require backpropagation for updating model parameters, which incurs computational overhead, privacy risks, and sensitivity to noisy data streams. This paper proposes Backpropagation-Free Transformations (BFT), a TTA approach for EEG decoding that eliminates such issues. BFT applies multiple sample-wise transformations of knowledge-guided augmentations or approximate Bayesian inference to each test trial, generating multiple prediction scores for a single test sample. A learning-to-rank module enhances the weighting of these predictions, enabling robust aggregation for uncertainty suppression during inference under theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments on five EEG datasets of motor imagery classification and driver drowsiness regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, robustness, and efficiency of BFT.

We call this phenomenon Artificial Jagged Intelligence (AJI). This paper develops a tractable economic model of AJI that treats adoption as an information problem: users care about \\emph{local} reliability, but typically observe only coarse, global quality signals. In a baseline one-dimensional landscape, truth is a rough Brownian process, and the model ``knows'' scattered points drawn from a Poisson process. The model interpolates optimally, and the local error is measured by posterior variance. We derive an adoption threshold for a blind user, show that experienced errors are amplified by the inspection paradox, and interpret scaling laws as denser coverage that improves average quality without eliminating jaggedness. We then study mastery and calibration: a calibrated user who can condition on local uncertainty enjoys positive expected value even in domains that fail the blind adoption test. Modelling mastery as learning a reliability map via Gaussian process regression yields a learning-rate bound driven by information gain, clarifying when discovering ``where the model works'' is slow. Finally, we study how scaling interacts with discoverability: when calibrated signals and user mastery accelerate the harvesting of scale improvements, and when opacity can make gains from scaling effectively invisible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u5de5\u952f\u9f7f\u667a\u80fd\uff08AJI\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u6237\u91c7\u7528\u9608\u503c\u3001\u638c\u63e1\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u53ef\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u53c2\u5dee\u4e0d\u9f50\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373AJI\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u91c7\u7528\u89c6\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\u9a8c\u65b9\u5dee\u8861\u91cf\u5c40\u90e8\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u638c\u63e1\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u76f2\u7528\u6237\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u88ab\u68c0\u67e5\u6096\u8bba\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u638c\u63e1\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u53ef\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6821\u51c6\u7528\u6237\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u76f2\u91c7\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e5f\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6b63\u671f\u671b\u503c\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u4f55\u65f6\u8f83\u6162\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6821\u51c6\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u7528\u6237\u638c\u63e1\u548c\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u5bf9\u6269\u5c55\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

While existing memory mechanisms offer basic storage and retrieval capabilities, they are hindered by two primary limitations: (1) rigid memory granularity often disrupts semantic integrity, resulting in fragmented and incoherent memory units; (2) prevalent flat retrieval paradigms rely solely on surface-level semantic similarity, neglecting the structural cues of discourse required to navigate and locate specific episodic contexts. To mitigate these limitations, drawing inspiration from Event Segmentation Theory, we propose ES-Mem, a framework incorporating two core components: (1) a dynamic event segmentation module that partitions long-term interactions into semantically coherent events with distinct boundaries; (2) a hierarchical memory architecture that constructs multi-layered memories and leverages boundary semantics to anchor specific episodic memory for precise context localization. Evaluations on two memory benchmarks demonstrate that ES-Mem yields consistent performance gains over baseline methods. Furthermore, the proposed event segmentation module exhibits robust applicability on dialogue segmentation datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faES - Mem\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u5757\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u521a\u6027\u5185\u5b58\u7c92\u5ea6\u7834\u574f\u8bed\u4e49\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u6241\u5e73\u68c0\u7d22\u8303\u5f0f\u5ffd\u89c6\u8bdd\u8bed\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faES - Mem\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5185\u5b58\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cES - Mem\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6709\u5f3a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ES - Mem\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Towards this goal, we introduce PoT, a semi-verifiable benchmarking framework that links scientific idea judgments to downstream signals that become observable later (e.g., citations and shifts in researchers' agendas). PoT freezes a pre-cutoff snapshot of evidence in an offline sandbox and asks models to forecast post-cutoff outcomes, enabling verifiable evaluation when ground truth arrives, scalable benchmarking without exhaustive expert annotation, and analysis of human-model misalignment against signals such as peer-review awards. In addition, PoT provides a controlled testbed for agent-based research judgments that evaluate scientific ideas, comparing tool-using agents to non-agent baselines under prompt ablations and budget scaling. Across 30,000+ instances spanning four benchmark domains, we find that, compared with non-agent baselines, higher interaction budgets generally improve agent performance, while the benefit of tool use is strongly task-dependent.

However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation.

Our results show that this framework enables robust, highly dynamic multi-contact motions, such as vaulting and dive-rolling, on unstructured terrain, significantly expanding the robot's traversability beyond simple walking or running. https://project-instinct.github.io/deep-whole-body-parkour", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u578b\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u901a\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u5f0f\u901a\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u6574\u5730\u5f62\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u975e locomotion \u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\u5404\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u5c06\u4e8c\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u5f0f\u901a\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u5916\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u5230\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u5f62\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5730\u5f62\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5065\u3001\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u63a5\u89e6\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5982\u8de8\u8d8a\u548c\u7ffb\u6eda\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9664\u884c\u8d70\u5916\u7684\u7a7f\u8d8a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well.

In this work, we present \\textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \\textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \\textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \\textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets. Our approach utilizes a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme, mapping raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions, without relying on external state estimation. Extensive field experiments on a full-size humanoid demonstrate that our policy enables robust traversal of complex terrains at speeds up to 2.5 m/s.

Unlike previous datasets that focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, UAIT challenges models with grammatically reasonable but semantically counter-common sense image-text pairs. Such tasks require models to go beyond superficial pattern recognition and demonstrate a deep understanding of agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility. To build UAIT, we designed a semi-automated process to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation. Each sample is accompanied by a carefully designed multiple-choice question to test the model's competence in fine-grained reasoning. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art visual language models and compare them with models based on contrastive learning. Experiments show that all models perform significantly worse than humans in semantic judgment, especially in distinguishing grammatical correctness from semantic rationality. Further experiments show that even the lightweight model can improve its accuracy after fine-tuning, demonstrating the great potential of directional adaptation.

In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension. We prove that MHLA maintains linear complexity while recovering much of the expressive power of softmax attention, and verify its effectiveness across multiple domains, achieving a 3.6\\% improvement on ImageNet classification, a 6.3\\% gain on NLP, a 12.6\\% improvement on image generation, and a 41\\% enhancement on video generation under the same time complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Transformer\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMulti - Head Linear Attention (MHLA)\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u9650\u5236\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMulti - Head Linear Attention (MHLA)\uff0c\u6cbftoken\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5728\u5212\u5206\u7684\u5934\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u8868\u793a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728ImageNet\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u63d0\u53473.6%\uff0cNLP\u4e0a\u63d0\u53476.3%\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u63d0\u534712.6%\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u63d0\u534741%\u3002", "conclusion": "MHLA\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u6062\u590dsoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}
