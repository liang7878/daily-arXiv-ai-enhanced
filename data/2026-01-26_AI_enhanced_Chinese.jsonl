While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.\n  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data.

Modern platforms with matrix multiplication accelerators exhibit high FLOP/Byte machine balance, which makes implementing optimal matrix multiplication challenging. On modern CPU platforms with matrix engines, state-of-the-art vendor libraries tune input tensor layouts, parallelization schemes, and cache blocking to minimize data movement across the memory hierarchy and maximize throughput. However, the best settings for these parameters depend strongly on the target platform (number of cores, memory hierarchy, cache sizes) and on the shapes of the matrices, making exhaustive tuning infeasible; in practice this leads to performance \"glass jaws\". In this work we revisit space filling curves (SFC) to alleviate the problem of this cumbersome tuning. SFC convert multi-dimensional coordinates (e.g. 2D) into a single dimension (1D), keeping nearby points in the high-dimensional space close in the 1D order. We partition the Matrix Multiplication computation space using recent advancements in generalized SFC (Generalized Hilbert Curves), and we obtain platform-oblivious and shape-oblivious matrix-multiplication schemes that exhibit inherently high degree of data locality. Furthermore, we extend the SFC-based work partitioning to implement Communication-Avoiding (CA) algorithms that replicate the input tensors and provably minimize communication/data-movement on the critical path.

In practice, however, different agents may rely on different game-theoretic models to design their strategies. As a result, when these heterogeneous models interact, the realized outcome can deviate substantially from the outcome each agent expects based on its own local model. In this work, we introduce the game-to-real gap, a new metric that quantifies the impact of such model misspecification in multi-agent environments. The game-to-real gap is defined as the difference between the utility an agent actually obtains in the multi-agent environment (where other agents may have misspecified models) and the utility it expects under its own game model. Focusing on quadratic network games, we show that misspecifications in either (i) the external shock or (ii) the player interaction network can lead to arbitrarily large game-to-real gaps. We further develop novel network centrality measures that allow exact evaluation of this gap in quadratic network games. Our analysis reveals that standard network centrality measures fail to capture the effects of model misspecification, underscoring the need for new structural metrics that account for this limitation.

A trie is a natural generalization of a string, which can be seen as a single-path tree. There is a linear-time offline algorithm to compute maximal palindromes and distinct palindromes in a given (static) trie whose edge-labels are drawn from a linearly-sortable alphabet [Mieno et al., ISAAC 2022]. In this paper, we tackle problems of palindrome enumeration on dynamic tries which support leaf additions and leaf deletions. We propose the first sub-quadratic algorithms to enumerate palindromes in a dynamic trie. For maximal palindromes, we propose an algorithm that runs in $O(N \\min(\\log h, \u03c3))$ time and uses $O(N)$ space, where $N$ is the maximum number of edges in the trie, $\u03c3$ is the size of the alphabet, and $h$ is the height of the trie. For distinct palindromes, we develop several online algorithms based on different algorithmic frameworks, including approaches using the EERTREE (a.k.a. palindromic tree) and the suffix tree of a trie. These algorithms support leaf insertions and deletions in the trie and achieve different time and space trade-offs.

We propose \\emph{WaveLSFormer}, a learnable wavelet-based long-short Transformer that jointly performs multi-scale decomposition and return-oriented decision learning. Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability. The model outputs a portfolio of long/short positions that is rescaled to satisfy a fixed risk budget, and is optimized directly with a trading objective and risk-aware regularization. Extensive experiments on five years of hourly data across six industry groups, evaluated over ten random seeds, demonstrate that WaveLSFormer consistently outperforms MLP, LSTM and Transformer backbones, with and without fixed discrete wavelet front-ends.

We introduce a comprehensive diagnostic framework that leverages big data analytics to evaluate procedural reliability in intelligent agent systems, addressing critical needs for SME-centric deployment in privacy-sensitive environments. Our approach features a 12-category error taxonomy capturing failure modes across tool initialization, parameter handling, execution, and result interpretation. Through systematic evaluation of 1,980 deterministic test instances spanning both open-weight models (Qwen2.5 series, Functionary) and proprietary alternatives (GPT-4, Claude 3.5/3.7) across diverse edge hardware configurations, we identify actionable reliability thresholds for production deployment. Our analysis reveals that procedural reliability, particularly tool initialization failures, constitutes the primary bottleneck for smaller models, while qwen2.5:32b achieves flawless performance matching GPT-4.1. The framework demonstrates that mid-sized models (qwen2.5:14b) offer practical accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on commodity hardware (96.6\\% success rate, 7.3 s latency), enabling cost-effective intelligent agent deployment for resource-constrained organizations.

In this paper, \"fully generated\" refers to code provenance: implementation changes were produced and applied as agent-proposed diffs; validation relied on agent-run builds, tests, and differential checks, without per-change manual diff review. It implements a PyTorch-style eager tensor library with a C++20 core (CPU+CUDA), a torch-like Python overlay via nanobind, and an experimental Node.js/TypeScript interface. Unlike thin bindings, VIBETENSOR includes its own tensor/storage system, schema-lite dispatcher, reverse-mode autograd, CUDA runtime (streams/events/graphs), a stream-ordered caching allocator with diagnostics, and a stable C ABI for dynamically loaded operator plugins. We view this release as a milestone for AI-assisted software engineering: it shows coding agents can generate a coherent deep learning runtime spanning language bindings down to CUDA memory management, validated primarily by builds and tests. We describe the architecture, summarize the workflow used to produce and validate the system, and evaluate the artifact. We report repository scale and test-suite composition, and summarize reproducible microbenchmarks from an accompanying AI-generated kernel suite, including fused attention versus PyTorch SDPA/FlashAttention. We also report end-to-end training sanity checks on 3 small workloads (sequence reversal, ViT, miniGPT) on NVIDIA H100 (Hopper, SM90) and Blackwell-class GPUs; multi-GPU results are Blackwell-only and use an optional CUTLASS-based ring-allreduce plugin gated on CUDA 13+ and sm103a toolchain support.

Through simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our theory enables accurate inference of true causal orders from observed discrete data and the identified ordering can significantly boost the accuracy of existing causal discovery baselines on nearly all of the settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53f6\u5224\u522b\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u4ece\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u56e0\u679c\u987a\u5e8f\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u7eaf\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60DAG\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u957f\u671f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5f97\u5206\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u62d3\u6251\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u6062\u590d\u56fe\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u60f3\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u60c5\u5f62\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u539f\u672c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u5230\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53f6\u5224\u522b\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u63a8\u65ad\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u56e0\u679c\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Availability of parallel resources can significantly speed up MCMC inference by running a large number of chains in parallel, each collecting a single sample. However, the parallel approach converges slowly if the chains are not initialized close to the target distribution (cold start). Theoretically this can be resolved by initially running MCMC without Metropolis-Hastings adjustment to quickly converge to the vicinity of the target distribution and then turn on adjustment to achieve fine convergence. However, no practical scheme uses this strategy, due to the difficulty of automatically selecting the step size during the unadjusted phase. We here develop Late Adjusted Parallel Sampler (LAPS), which is precisely such a scheme and is applicable out of the box, all the hyperparameters are selected automatically. LAPS takes advantage of ensemble-based hyperparameter adaptation to estimate the bias at each iteration and converts it to the appropriate step size. We show that LAPS consistently and significantly outperforms ensemble adjusted methods such as MEADS or ChESS and the optimization-based initializer Pathfinder on a variety of standard benchmark problems.

Despite its great potential in unifying retrieval and ranking, existing GSR frameworks still face two critical limitations: (1) impure and unstable semantic tokenization, where quantization methods struggle with interaction noise and codebook collapse, resulting in SIDs with ambiguous discrimination; and (2) lossy and weakly structured generation, where reliance solely on coarse-grained discrete tokens inevitably introduces information loss and neglects items' hierarchical logic. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative recommendation framework, PRISM, with Purified Representation and Integrated Semantic Modeling. Specifically, to ensure high-quality tokenization, we design a Purified Semantic Quantizer that constructs a robust codebook via adaptive collaborative denoising and hierarchical semantic anchoring mechanisms. To compensate for information loss during quantization, we further propose an Integrated Semantic Recommender, which incorporates a dynamic semantic integration mechanism to integrate fine-grained semantics and enforces logical validity through a semantic structure alignment objective.

The communities themselves form a collection of vertex-disjoint sparse cuts in the expected graph, and can be recovered, often exactly, from a sample as long as a separation condition on the intra- and inter-community edge probabilities is satisfied.\n  In this paper, we ask whether the presence of a large number of overlapping sparsest cuts in the expected graph still allows recovery. For example, the $d$-dimensional hypercube graph admits $d$ distinct (balanced) sparsest cuts, one for every coordinate. Can these cuts be identified given a random sample of the edges of the hypercube where each edge is present independently with some probability $p\\in (0, 1)$? We show that this is the case, in a very strong sense: the sparsest balanced cut in a sample of the hypercube at rate $p=C\\log d/d$ for a sufficiently large constant $C$ is $1/\\text{poly}(d)$-close to a coordinate cut with high probability. This is asymptotically optimal and allows approximate recovery of all $d$ cuts simultaneously. Furthermore, for an appropriate sample of hypercube-like graphs recovery can be made exact. The proof is essentially a strong hypercube cut sparsification bound that combines a theorem of Friedgut, Kalai and Naor on boolean functions whose Fourier transform concentrates on the first level of the Fourier spectrum with Karger's cut counting argument.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u671f\u671b\u56fe\u4e2d\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u53e0\u6700\u7a00\u758f\u5272\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4ee5\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u56fe\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6216\u7cbe\u786e\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u4e2d\u79cd\u690d\u793e\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u671f\u671b\u56fe\u4e2d\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u53e0\u6700\u7a00\u758f\u5272\u7684\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Friedgut\u3001Kalai\u548cNaor\u5173\u4e8e\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ea7\u7684\u5b9a\u7406\u4e0eKarger\u7684\u5272\u8ba1\u6570\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u56fe\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e00\u5b9a\u901f\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u7a00\u758f\u5e73\u8861\u5272\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u5750\u6807\u5272\uff0c\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6062\u590d\u6240\u6709\u5272\uff0c\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u7c7b\u56fe\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u6062\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u671f\u671b\u56fe\u4e2d\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u53e0\u6700\u7a00\u758f\u5272\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6216\u7cbe\u786e\u6062\u590d\u3002"}}

These two approaches to software verification have long been presented as opposites. One is dynamic, the other static: a test executes the program, a proof only analyzes the program text. A different perspective is emerging, in which testing and proving are complementary rather than competing techniques for producing software of verified quality.\n  Work performed over the past few years and reviewed here develops this complementarity by taking advantage of Design by Contract, as available in Eiffel, and exploiting a feature of modern program-proving tools based on ``Satisfiability Modulo Theories'' (SMT): counterexample generation. A counterexample is an input combination that makes the program fail. If we are trying to prove a program correct, we hope not to find any. One can, however, apply counterexample generation to incorrect programs, as a tool for automatic test generation.

This paper introduces a cyber-risk management framework for networked digital systems that combines the strategic behavior of players with contagion dynamics within a security game. We address the problem of optimally allocating cybersecurity resources across a network, focusing on the heterogeneous valuations of nodes by attackers and defenders, some areas may be of high interest to the attacker, while others are prioritized by the defender. We explore how this asymmetry drives attack and defense strategies and shapes the system's overall resilience. We extend a method to determine optimal resource allocation based on simple network metrics weighted by the defender's and attacker's risk profiles. We further propose risk measures based on contagion paths and analyze how propagation dynamics influence optimal defense strategies. Numerical experiments explore risk versus cost efficient frontiers varying network topologies and risk profiles, revealing patterns of resource allocation and cyber deception effects.

Spectral methods for directed SBMs often lack stability in asymmetric, low-degree regimes, and existing non-spectral approaches focus primarily on undirected or dense settings.\n  We propose a fully non-spectral, two-stage procedure for community detection in sparse directed SBMs with potentially growing numbers of communities. The method first estimates the directed probability matrix using a neighborhood-smoothing scheme tailored to the asymmetric setting, and then applies $K$-means clustering to the estimated rows, thereby avoiding the limitations of eigen- or singular value decompositions in sparse, asymmetric networks. Our main theoretical contribution is a uniform row-wise concentration bound for the smoothed estimator, obtained through new arguments that control asymmetric neighborhoods and separate in- and out-degree effects. These results imply the exact recovery of all community labels with probability tending to one, under mild sparsity and separation conditions that allow both $\u03b3_n \\to 0$ and $K_n \\to \\infty$.\n  Simulation studies, including highly directed, sparse, and non-symmetric block structures, demonstrate that the proposed procedure performs reliably in regimes where directed spectral and score-based methods deteriorate.

This paper presents a robust, fully automated framework that transforms unstructured B-rep geometry into knowledge-graph-based Building Information Models and further into executable Building Energy Models. The framework enables artificial intelligence to explicitly interpret building elements, spatial topology, and their associated thermal and performance attributes. It integrates automated geometry cleansing, multiple auto space-generation strategies, graph-based extraction of space and element topology, ontology-aligned knowledge modeling, and reversible transformation between ontology-based BIM and EnergyPlus energy models. Validation on parametric, sketch-based, and real-world building datasets demonstrates high robustness, consistent topological reconstruction, and reliable performance-model generation.

This study proposes a four-stage transaction management framework for document-oriented NoSQL databases, with MongoDB as the reference platform. The framework combines transaction lifecycle management, operation classification, pre-execution conflict detection, and an adaptive locking strategy with timeout-based deadlock prevention. Formal correctness analysis shows that the proposed approach guarantees conflict serializability under defined conditions. An experimental evaluation using the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) workloads A, B, and F, with concurrency levels ranging from 1 to 100 clients, demonstrates a reduction in transaction abort rates from 8.3% to 4.7%, the elimination of observed deadlocks, and a 34.2% decrease in latency variance. Throughput improvements ranging from 6.3% to 18.4% are observed under high concurrency, particularly for read-modify-write workloads. Distributed experiments on clusters of up to 9 nodes confirm scalability, achieving 15.2% higher throughput and 53% lower abort rates than baseline systems. Comparisons with MongoDB's native transactions, CockroachDB, and TiDB indicate that the proposed framework strikes a good balance between consistency guarantees and performance overhead. Sensitivity analysis identifies optimal parameter settings, including a lock timeout of 100 ms, an initial backoff of 10 ms, and a maximum backoff of 500 ms. These results show that carefully designed consistency mechanisms can significantly improve data integrity in NoSQL systems without undermining scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u9762\u5411\u6587\u6863\u7684NoSQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u4e8b\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "NoSQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u7ec8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u9760\u4e8b\u52a1\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e8b\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u4e8b\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u52a1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u9884\u6267\u884c\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9501\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u65f6\u7684\u6b7b\u9501\u9884\u9632\u3002", "result": "\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8b\u52a1\u4e2d\u6b62\u7387\u3001\u6d88\u9664\u6b7b\u9501\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347NoSQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

However, its efficient deployment on Huawei's Ascend 910 Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is challenging due to limited native mixed-precision support and the accelerator's decoupled compute architecture. To enable quantization on such architecture, we present the first practical W4A16 matrix multiplication kernel tailored for the Ascend 910 NPU. Our design leverages vector cores for on-the-fly INT4-to-FP16 dequantization, cube cores for high-throughput GEMM, and Split-K parallelization to mitigate memory latency. Performance evaluations across diverse matrix shapes and batch sizes show our method outperforms data-parallel approaches when K >> N, a typical scenario in LLM decoding. Specially, our method can achieve a speedup ranging from 1.01x to 1.74x. In addition, our profile reveals the primary bottleneck is not dequantization compution itself, but extra global memory transfer for the weight, making W4A16 only reaching a maximum speedup of 1.48x over native FP16xFP16 matrix multiplication in PyTorch.

This problem is especially evident in financial technologies, where innovations develop quickly, patent collections grow continuously, and citation recommendation systems must be updated as new applications arrive. Existing patent retrieval and citation recommendation methods typically rely on static indexes or periodic retraining, which limits their ability to operate effectively in such dynamic settings. In this study, we propose a real-time patent citation recommendation framework designed for large and fast-changing financial patent corpora. Using a dataset of 428,843 financial patents granted by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) between 2000 and 2024, we build a three-stage recommendation pipeline. The pipeline uses large language model (LLM) embeddings to represent the semantic content of patent abstracts, applies efficient approximate nearest-neighbor search to construct a manageable candidate set, and ranks candidates by semantic similarity to produce top-k citation recommendations. In addition to improving recommendation accuracy, the proposed framework directly addresses the dynamic nature of patent systems. By using an incremental indexing strategy based on hierarchical navigable small-world (HNSW) graphs, newly issued patents can be added without rebuilding the entire index. A rolling day-by-day update experiment shows that incremental updating improves recall while substantially reducing computational cost compared with rebuild-based indexing.

A notable special case is Partial $k$-Dominating Set, where one chooses $k$ vertices in a graph to maximize the number of dominated vertices.\n  Extensive research has established strong hardness results for various aspects of Maximum $k$-Coverage, such as tight inapproximability results, $W[2]$-hardness, and a conditionally tight worst-case running time of $n^{k\\pm o(1)}$. In this paper we ask: (1) Can this time bound be improved for small $t$, at least for Partial $k$-Dominating Set, ideally to time~$t^{k\\pm O(1)}$? (2) More ambitiously, can we even determine the best-possible running time of Maximum $k$-Coverage with respect to the perhaps most natural parameters: the universe size $u$, the maximum set size $s$, and the maximum frequency $f$?\n  We successfully resolve both questions. (1) We give an algorithm that solves Partial $k$-Dominating Set in time $O(nt + t^{\\frac{2\u03c9}{3} k+O(1)})$ if $\u03c9\\ge 2.25$ and time $O(nt+ t^{\\frac{3}{2} k+O(1)})$ if $\u03c9\\le 2.25$, where $\u03c9\\le 2.372$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. From this we derive a time bound that is conditionally optimal, regardless of $\u03c9$, based on the well-established $k$-clique and 3-uniform hyperclique hypotheses from fine-grained complexity. We also obtain matching upper and lower bounds for sparse graphs. To address (2) we design an algorithm for Maximum $k$-Coverage running in time\n  $$\n  \\min \\left\\{ (f\\cdot \\min\\{\\sqrt[3]{u}, \\sqrt{s}\\})^k + \\min\\{n,f\\cdot \\min\\{\\sqrt{u}, s\\}\\}^{k\u03c9/3}, n^k\\right\\}\n  \\cdot g(k)n^{\\pm O(1)}, $$ and, surprisingly, further show that this complicated time bound is also conditionally optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u5927k\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c0ft\u65f6\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u80fd\u5426\u6539\u8fdb\u53ca\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6700\u5927k\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f3a\u786c\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u60f3\u63a2\u7a76\u5c0ft\u65f6\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u80fd\u5426\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206k\u652f\u914d\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u7ed9\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u63a8\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\uff1b\u4e3a\u6700\u5927k\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u90e8\u5206k\u652f\u914d\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6761\u4ef6\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\uff1b\u4e3a\u6700\u5927k\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6240\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\u662f\u6761\u4ef6\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce DSGym, a standardized framework for evaluating and training data science agents in self-contained execution environments. Unlike static benchmarks, DSGym provides a modular architecture that makes it easy to add tasks, agent scaffolds, and tools, positioning it as a live, extensible testbed. We curate DSGym-Tasks, a holistic task suite that standardizes and refines existing benchmarks via quality and shortcut solvability filtering. We further expand coverage with (1) DSBio: expert-derived bioinformatics tasks grounded in literature and (2) DSPredict: challenging prediction tasks spanning domains such as computer vision, molecular prediction, and single-cell perturbation. Beyond evaluation, DSGym enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis pipeline. As a case study, we build a 2,000-example training set and trained a 4B model in DSGym that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks.

While modern issue-tracking systems facilitate the reporting of such problems, labeling concurrency-related bug reports remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. This paper presents a linguistic-pattern-based framework for automatically identifying concurrency bug reports. We derive 58 distinct linguistic patterns from 730 manually labeled concurrency bug reports, organized across four levels: word-level (keywords), phrase-level (n-grams), sentence-level (semantic), and bug report-level (contextual). To assess their effectiveness, we evaluate four complementary approaches-matching, learning, prompt-based, and fine-tuning-spanning traditional machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and pre-trained language models (PLMs). Our comprehensive evaluation on 12 large-scale open-source projects (10,920 issue reports from GitHub and Jira) demonstrates that fine-tuning PLMs with linguistic-pattern-enriched inputs achieves the best performance, reaching a precision of 91% on GitHub and 93% on Jira, and maintaining strong precision on post cut-off data (91%). The contributions of this work include: (1) a comprehensive taxonomy of linguistic patterns for concurrency bugs, (2) a novel fine-tuning strategy that integrates domain-specific linguistic knowledge into PLMs, and (3) a curated, labeled dataset to support reproducible research. Together, these advances provide a foundation for improving the automation, precision, and interpretability of concurrency bug classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u53d1\u9519\u8bef\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e30\u5bcc\u8f93\u5165\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6838\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u5e76\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u53d1\u76f8\u5173\u9519\u8bef\u62a5\u544a\u4efb\u52a1\u7e41\u7410\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002", "method": "\u4ece730\u4e2a\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5e76\u53d1\u9519\u8bef\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d658\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u56db\u4e2a\u7ea7\u522b\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5339\u914d\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e30\u5bcc\u8f93\u5165\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff0cGitHub\u4e0a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe91%\uff0cJira\u4e0a\u8fbe93%\uff0c\u622a\u6b62\u540e\u6570\u636e\u7cbe\u5ea691%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

High estimation accuracy is achieved by shrinking noise from unimportant groups using a grouped global-local shrinkage prior. To ensure computational scalability, we approximate posterior summaries using coordinate ascent variational inference and recast the penalized credible region framework as a convex optimization problem that admits efficient computations. We prove that the resultant post-processed estimators are both parameter-consistent and variable selection consistent in high-dimensional settings.

Despite three decades of standardization efforts, over 40 metadata schemas now span the building lifecycle, with fragmentation accelerating rather than resolving. Current approaches rely on point-to-point mappings that scale quadratically with the number of schemas, or universal ontologies that become unwieldy monoliths. The fundamental gap is the absence of mathematical foundations for structure-preserving transformations across heterogeneous building data. Here we show that category theory provides these foundations, enabling systematic data integration with $O(n)$ specification complexity for $n$ ontologies. We formalize building ontologies as first-order theories and demonstrate two proof-of-concept implementations in Categorical Query Language (CQL): 1) generating BRICK models from IFC design data at commissioning, and 2) three-way integration of IFC, BRICK, and RealEstateCore where only two explicit mappings yield the third automatically through categorical composition. Our correct-by-construction approach treats property sets as first-class schema entities and provides automated bidirectional migrations, and enables cross-ontology queries.

We present GOXN (Green Observability eXperiment eNginE), an energy experimentation engine for Kubernetes-based microservices that quantifies compute, network, and storage energy at the service level.

Traditional methods, such as item-to-item collaborative filtering (CF) and two-tower models, often fall short in capturing the complex user-item interactions due to uniform truncation strategies and overdue user-item crossing. To address these limitations, we propose Personalized Item-to-Item (PI2I), a novel two-stage retrieval framework that enhances the personalization capabilities of CF. In the first Indexer Building Stage (IBS), we optimize the retrieval pool by relaxing truncation thresholds to maximize Hit Rate, thereby temporarily retaining more items users might be interested in. In the second Personalized Retrieval Stage (PRS), we introduce an interactive scoring model to overcome the limitations of inner product calculations, allowing for richer modeling of intricate user-item interactions. Additionally, we construct negative samples based on the trigger-target (item-to-item) relationship, ensuring consistency between offline training and online inference. Offline experiments on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that PI2I outperforms traditional CF methods and rivals Two-Tower models. Deployed in the \"Guess You Like\" section on Taobao, PI2I achieved a 1.05% increase in online transaction rates. In addition, we have released a large-scale recommendation dataset collected from Taobao, containing 130 million real-world user interactions used in the experiments of this paper.

We study the maximum displacement problem: with coalition size $m$, how many of the current top-$k$ winners can be forced out? We show coalition power decomposes into two independent prefix-majorization constraints, capturing how much the coalition can (i) boost outsiders and (ii) suppress weak winners. For arbitrary scoring rules these prefix inequalities are tight, efficiently checkable necessary conditions (exact in the continuous relaxation).\n  For common-step arithmetic-progression (AP) score ladders, including Borda, truncated Borda, $k$-approval/$k$-veto, plurality, and multi-level rules such as $3$--$2$--$1$, we prove a Majorization--Lattice Theorem: feasible aggregate score vectors are exactly the integer points satisfying the Block--HLP prefix-sum capacity constraints plus a single global congruence condition modulo the step size $g$. For Borda ($g=1$) the congruence vanishes, yielding a pure prefix-majorization test.\n  This characterization yields an $O(k'\\log k')$ exact feasibility oracle for displacing $k'$ winners, and an $O(k(\\log k)^2\\log(mx))$ algorithm (via dual-envelope binary search) for computing the maximum achievable displacement $k^\\ast$. Experiments on Mallows profiles and PrefLib elections confirm exact cutoffs, diminishing returns, and substantial gains over baseline heuristics; for $g>1$ they also demonstrate the predicted congruence effect, where prefix-only tests produce false positives.

This proposed transfer learning approach involves pre-training models on the augmented dataset and fine-tuning them on the non-augmented dataset while ensuring strict data separation to prevent data leakage. The results demonstrate significant improvements in classification performance compared to the baseline approach. Among three CNN architectures, DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy of 94% and an AUC score of 99% using the proposed transfer learning approach.

Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an \"expert bottleneck\" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation.

Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that our method can identify a larger number of unimportant edges as compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u56fe\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528Ollivier - Ricci\u66f2\u7387\uff08ORC\uff09\u5b9a\u4e49\u795e\u7ecf\u66f2\u7387\uff08NC\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fb9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u786e\u5b9a\u5bf9\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u590d\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7531\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u56fe\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eORC\u5f15\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u66f2\u7387\uff1b\u6839\u636e\u4e00\u7ec4\u8f93\u5165\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f2\u7387\uff1b\u7528NC\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u79fb\u9664\u8d1fORC\u8fb9\u4f1a\u8fc5\u901f\u964d\u4f4e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6b63ORC\u8fb9\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u66f4\u591a\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8fb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8fb9\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While weather impacts railway reliability, particularly in Nordic regions, existing datasets rarely integrate meteorological information with operational train data. This study presents the first publicly available dataset combining Finnish railway operations with synchronized meteorological observations from 2018-2024. The dataset integrates operational metrics from Finland Digitraffic Railway Traffic Service with weather measurements from 209 environmental monitoring stations, using spatial-temporal alignment via Haversine distance. It encompasses 28 engineered features across operational variables and meteorological measurements, covering approximately 38.5 million observations from Finland's 5,915-kilometer rail network. Preprocessing includes strategic missing data handling through spatial fallback algorithms, cyclical encoding of temporal features, and robust scaling of weather data to address sensor outliers. Analysis reveals distinct seasonal patterns, with winter months exhibiting delay rates exceeding 25\\% and geographic clustering of high-delay corridors in central and northern Finland.

Ex-ante fairness (proportionality) can trivially be obtained by giving all goods to a random agent. Yet, such an allocation is very unfair ex-post. This has motivated the Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) approach, seeking a randomized allocation that is ex-ante proportional and is supported only on ex-post fair allocations (e.g., on allocations that are envy-free-up-to-one-good (EF1), or give some constant fraction of the maximin share (MMS)). It is commonly pointed out that the distribution that allocates all goods to one agent at random fails to be ex-post fair as it ignores the variances of the values of the agents. We examine the approach of trying to mitigate this problem by minimizing the sum-of-variances of the values of the agents, subject to ex-ante proportionality. We study the ex-post fairness properties of the resulting distributions. In support of this approach, observe that such an optimization will indeed deterministically output a proportional allocation if such exists. We show that when valuations are identical, this approach indeed guarantees fairness ex-post: all allocations in the support are envy-free-up-to-any-good (EFX), and thus guarantee every agent at least 4/7 of her maximin share (but not her full MMS). On the negative side, we show that this approach completely fails when valuations are not identical: even in the simplest setting of only two agents and two goods, when the additive valuations are not identical, there is positive probability of allocating both goods to the same agent. Thus, the supporting ex-post allocation might not even be EF1, and might not give an agent any constant fraction of her MMS. Finally, we present similar negative results for other natural minimization objectives that are based on variances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5177\u6709\u52a0\u6027\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u5546\u54c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4ef7\u503c\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c1\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u867d\u5177\u6709\u4e8b\u524d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4f46\u4e8b\u540e\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51faBest - of - Both - Worlds\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4ef7\u503c\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u6765\u6539\u5584\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e8b\u524d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u5f97\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e8b\u540e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f30\u503c\u76f8\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e8b\u540e\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5206\u914d\u90fd\u662fEFX\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u81f3\u5c11\u83b7\u5f974/7\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u4efd\u989d\uff1b\u4f30\u503c\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230EF1\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4ee3\u7406\u83b7\u5f97\u6052\u5b9a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u4efd\u989d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f30\u503c\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e5f\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8d1f\u9762\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Focusing on combinatorial optimization, we refine outputs from the FunSearch algorithm [Romera-Paredes et al., Nature 2023] to derive state-of-the-art lower bounds for standard heuristics. Specifically, we target the generation of adversarial instances where these heuristics perform poorly. By iterating on FunSearch's outputs, we identify improved constructions for hierarchical $k$-median clustering, bin packing, the knapsack problem, and a generalization of Lov\u00e1sz's gasoline problem - some of these have not seen much improvement for over a decade, despite intermittent attention. These results illustrate how expert oversight can effectively extrapolate algorithmic insights from LLM-based evolutionary methods to break long-standing barriers.\n  Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs provide critical initial patterns, human expertise is essential for transforming these patterns into mathematically rigorous and insightful constructions.

The upper-level decision variable parameterizes the reward of the lower-level MDP, and the upper-level objective depends on the optimal induced policy. Existing methods for bi-level optimization and RL often require second-order information, impose strong regularization at the lower level, or inefficiently use samples through nested-loop procedures. In this work, we propose a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm that optimizes the bi-level objective via a penalty-based reformulation. We introduce into the lower-level RL objective an attenuating entropy regularization, which enables asymptotically unbiased upper-level hyper-gradient estimation without solving the unregularized RL problem exactly. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point of the original, unregularized bi-level optimization problem through a novel lower-level residual analysis under a special type of Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition.

Satellite-based remote sensing offers an effective way to monitor vegetation and climate variables on regional and global scales. The annual peak Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from satellite observations, is closely associated with crop development, rangeland biomass, and vegetation growth. Although various machine learning methods have been developed to forecast NDVI over short time ranges, such as one-month-ahead predictions, long-term forecasting approaches, such as one-year-ahead predictions of vegetation conditions, are not yet available. To fill this gap, we develop a two-phase machine learning model to forecast the one-year-ahead peak NDVI over high-resolution grids, using the Four Corners region of the Southwestern United States as a testbed. In phase one, we identify informative climate attributes, including precipitation and maximum vapor pressure deficit, and develop the generalized parallel Gaussian process that captures the relationship between climate attributes and NDVI. In phase two, we forecast these climate attributes using historical data at least one year before the NDVI prediction month, which then serve as inputs to forecast the peak NDVI at each spatial grid.

Checkpointing this massive, distributed state is critical for a wide range of use cases, such as resilience, suspend-resume, investigating undesirable training trajectories, and explaining model evolution. However, existing checkpointing solutions typically treat model state as opaque binary blobs, ignoring the ``3D heterogeneity'' of the underlying data structures--varying by memory location (GPU vs. Host), number of ``logical'' objects sharded and split across multiple files, data types (tensors vs. Python objects), and their serialization requirements. This results in significant runtime overheads due to blocking device-to-host transfers, data-oblivious serialization, and storage I/O contention. In this paper, we introduce DataStates-LLM, a novel checkpointing architecture that leverages State Providers to decouple state abstraction from data movement. DataStates-LLM exploits the immutability of model parameters during the forward and backward passes to perform ``lazy'', non-blocking asynchronous snapshots. By introducing State Providers, we efficiently coalesce fragmented, heterogeneous shards and overlap the serialization of metadata with bulk tensor I/O. We evaluate DataStates-LLM on models up to 70B parameters on 256 A100-40GB GPUs. Our results demonstrate that DataStates-LLM achieves up to 4$\\times$ higher checkpointing throughput and reduces end-to-end training time by up to 2.2$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions, effectively mitigating the serialization and heterogeneity bottlenecks in extreme-scale LLM training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDataStates - LLM\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u89e3\u8026\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5757\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u201c3D\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u201d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DataStates - LLM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u89e3\u8026\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u201c\u60f0\u6027\u201d\u975e\u963b\u585e\u5f02\u6b65\u5feb\u7167\uff0c\u5408\u5e76\u788e\u7247\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e0e\u6279\u91cf\u5f20\u91cfI/O\u3002", "result": "\u5728256\u4e2aA100 - 40GB GPU\u4e0a\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8fbe70B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cDataStates - LLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe4\u500d\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c112.2\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DataStates - LLM\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option.

While empirically effective, the theoretical generalization properties of these methods in high-dimensional settings remain to be explored. To this end, we build the generalization theory on RLHF of LLMs under the linear reward model, through the framework of algorithmic stability. In contrast to the existing works built upon the consistency of maximum likelihood estimations on reward model, our analysis is presented under an end-to-end learning framework, which is consistent with practice. Concretely, we prove that under a key \\textbf{feature coverage} condition, the empirical optima of policy model have a generalization bound of order $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-\\frac{1}{2}})$. Moreover, the results can be extrapolated to parameters obtained by gradient-based learning algorithms, i.e., Gradient Ascent (GA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA).

Yet, a robust framework to quantify local model errors is still lacking. While the local uncertainty of PCE prediction can be captured using bootstrap resampling, other methods offering more rigorous statistical guarantees are needed, especially in the context of small training datasets. Recently, conformal predictions have demonstrated strong potential in machine learning, providing statistically robust and model-agnostic prediction intervals. Due to its generality and versatility, conformal prediction is especially valuable, as it can be adapted to suit a variety of problems, making it a compelling choice for PCE-based surrogate models. In this contribution, we explore its application to PCE-based surrogate models. More precisely, we present the integration of two conformal prediction methods, namely the full conformal and the Jackknife+ approaches, into both full and sparse PCEs. For full PCEs, we introduce computational shortcuts inspired by the inherent structure of regression methods to optimize the implementation of both conformal methods. For sparse PCEs, we incorporate the two approaches with appropriate modifications to the inference strategy, thereby circumventing the non-symmetrical nature of the regression algorithm and ensuring valid prediction intervals. Our developments yield better-calibrated prediction intervals for both full and sparse PCEs, achieving superior coverage over existing approaches, such as the bootstrap, while maintaining a moderate computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5c06\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6df7\u6c8c\u5c55\u5f00\uff08PCE\uff09\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5168 PCE \u548c\u7a00\u758f PCE\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u91cf\u5316 PCE \u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u800c\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5168\u5171\u5f62\u548c Jackknife+ \u4e24\u79cd\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5168 PCE \u548c\u7a00\u758f PCE \u4e2d\uff0c\u5168 PCE \u5f15\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u6377\u5f84\uff0c\u7a00\u758f PCE \u4fee\u6539\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u5168 PCE \u548c\u7a00\u758f PCE \u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982 bootstrap\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9002\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e PCE \u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u3002"}}

Motivated by these considerations, our objective is to quantify the tradeoff between maximizing the principal's utility and equalizing payments among agents, which we call the price of non-discrimination. Our first result is an almost tight bound on the price of non-discrimination, which scales logarithmically with the number of agents.

We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task?

Extreme class imbalance biases conventional models toward majority-class predictions, limiting recall, calibration, and operational usefulness. We propose LPCORP (Low-Prevalence CORrector for Prediction)*, a two-stage framework that combines reasoningenhanced prediction with confidence-based outcome correction. A reasoning model first produces enriched predictions from narrative inputs, after which a lightweight logistic-regression classifier evaluates and selectively corrects these outputs to mitigate prevalence-driven bias. We evaluate LPCORP on real-world datasets from medical and consumer service domains. The results show that this method transforms a highly imbalanced setting into a well-balanced one while preserving the original number of samples and without applying any resampling strategies. Test-set evaluation demonstrates substantially improved performance, particularly in precision, which is a known weakness in low-prevalence data. We further provide a costreduction analysis comparing the expenses associated with rare-event damage control without preventive measures to those incurred when low-cost, prediction-based preventive interventions are applied that showed more than 50% reduction in some cases. * Patent pending: U.S. Provisional 63/933,518, filed 8 December 2025.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLPCORP\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLPCORP\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u7531\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6821\u6b63\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u6d41\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "LPCORP\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

While recent work has explored the use of LLMs in isolated decision tasks, little attention has been given to optimizing long-term objectives through dialogue. We introduce \\textbf{GameTalk}, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction.

While algorithmic homogeneity is well-documented, the distinct evolutionary pathways driven by content-based versus link-based recommendations remain unclear. Using an extended dynamic Bounded Confidence Model (BCM), we show that content-based algorithms--unlike their link-based counterparts--steer social networks toward a segregation-before-polarization (SbP) pathway. Along this trajectory, structural segregation precedes opinion divergence, accelerating individual isolation while delaying but ultimately intensifying collective polarization. Furthermore, we reveal a paradox in information sharing: Reposting increases the number of connections in the network, yet it simultaneously reinforces echo chambers because it amplifies small, latent opinion differences that would otherwise remain inconsequential.

LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5f00\u6e90\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578bLongCat - Flash - Thinking - 2601\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u5353\u8d8a\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u5e76\u884c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u3001\u73af\u5883\u7b49\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u5f02\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6DORA\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Heavy Thinking\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "LongCat - Flash - Thinking - 2601\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Beyond serving as code auto-completion tools in integrated development environments, large language models increasingly function as foundation models within coding agents in vibe-coding scenarios. In such settings, prompts play a central role in agent-based intelligent software development, as they not only guide the behavior of large language models but also serve as carriers of user requirements. Under the dominant conversational paradigm, prompts are typically divided into system prompts and user prompts. System prompts provide high-level instructions to steer model behavior and establish conversational context, while user prompts represent inputs and requirements provided by human users. Despite their importance, designing effective prompts remains challenging, as it requires expertise in both prompt engineering and software engineering, particularly requirements engineering. To reduce the burden of manual prompt construction, numerous automated prompt engineering methods have been proposed. However, most existing approaches neglect the methodological principles of requirements engineering, limiting their ability to generate artifacts that conform to formal requirement specifications in realistic software development scenarios. To address this gap, we propose REprompt, a multi-agent prompt optimization framework guided by requirements engineering. Experiment results demonstrate that REprompt effectively optimizes both system and user prompts by grounding prompt generation in requirements engineering principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faREprompt\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREprompt\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eREprompt\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u3002", "conclusion": "REprompt\u57fa\u4e8e\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u3002"}}

While the approximation power of neural networks is now relatively well understood, training very deep architectures remains challenging due to highly non-convex and often ill-conditioned optimization landscapes. In contrast, for relatively shallow networks, most notably one-hidden-layer $\\texttt{ReLU}$ models, training admits convex reformulations with global guarantees, motivating learning paradigms that improve stability while scaling to depth. MGDL builds upon this insight by training deep networks grade by grade: previously learned grades are frozen, and each new residual block is trained solely to reduce the remaining approximation error, yielding an interpretable and stable hierarchical refinement process. We develop an operator-theoretic foundation for MGDL and prove that, for any continuous target function, there exists a fixed-width multigrade $\\texttt{ReLU}$ scheme whose residuals decrease strictly across grades and converge uniformly to zero. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantee that grade-wise training yields provable vanishing approximation error in deep networks.

This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u9a8c\u8bc1AI\u652f\u6301\u5e73\u53f0\u8f85\u52a9\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u4eba\u5458\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u7ef4\u4fee\u533b\u7597\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6\u533b\u7597\u8bbe\u5907\u7ef4\u62a4\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u5b9a\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ca\u65f6\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u6280\u672f\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u5382\u5546\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5927\u91cf\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u8bbe\u5907\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u60a3\u8005\u62a4\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8bbe\u5907\u7ef4\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u96c6\u6210\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7f51\u7edc\u754c\u9762\u7684AI\u652f\u6301\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6280\u672f\u4eba\u5458\u8f93\u5165\u9519\u8bef\u4ee3\u7801\u6216\u75c7\u72b6\u83b7\u53d6\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u6709\u5168\u7403\u540c\u884c\u8ba8\u8bba\u8bba\u575b\u3002", "result": "\u4ee5\u98de\u5229\u6d66HDI 5000\u8d85\u58f0\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u4ee3\u7801\u89e3\u91ca\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe100%\uff0c\u7ea0\u6b63\u63aa\u65bd\u5efa\u8bae\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe80%\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u533b\u7597\u8bbe\u5907\u7ef4\u62a4\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8bbe\u5907\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u533b\u7597\u670d\u52a1\u3002"}}

Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation.

While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08BED\uff09\u4e2d\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "BED\u4e2d\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u957f\u671f\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u8bdd\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u4e0d\u540c\u51c6\u5219\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u793a\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660eWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u6e90\u53cd\u6f14\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u65f6\uff0cKL\u6563\u5ea6\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u65f6\uff0cWasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2fBED\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645BED\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u5219\u3002"}}

To handle communication limits, FedSGM incorporates bi-directional error feedback, correcting the bias introduced by compression while explicitly understanding the interaction between compression noise and multi-step local updates. We derive convergence guarantees showing that the averaged iterate achieves the canonical $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate, with additional high-probability bounds that decouple optimization progress from sampling noise due to partial participation. Additionally, we introduce a soft switching version of FedSGM to stabilize updates near the feasibility boundary. To our knowledge, FedSGM is the first framework to unify functional constraints, compression, multiple local updates, and partial client participation, establishing a theoretically grounded foundation for constrained federated learning.

This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks.

Programming languages and execution models strongly influence software energy consumption, with interpreted languages generally being less efficient than compiled ones. Lua illustrates this trade-off: despite its popularity, it is less energy-efficient than greener and faster languages such as C.\n  This paper presents an empirical study of Lua's runtime performance and energy efficiency across 25 official interpreter versions and just-in-time (JIT) compilers. Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter. Moreover, LuaJIT approaches C's efficiency, using roughly six times more energy and running about eight times slower, demonstrating the substantial benefits of JIT compilation for improving both performance and energy efficiency in interpreted languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf925\u4e2aLua\u5b98\u65b9\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u7248\u672c\u548cJIT\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LuaJIT\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u8fdc\u8d85\u6807\u51c6Lua\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1C\u8bed\u8a00\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u89c6\u8282\u80fd\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e14\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u800cLua\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5206\u6790Lua\u6f14\u53d8\u3001JIT\u7f16\u8bd1\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709LuaJIT\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6Lua\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\uff0c\u6700\u8282\u80fd\u7684LuaJIT\u80fd\u8017\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73Lua\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5c11\u7ea67\u500d\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb7\u500d\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1C\u8bed\u8a00\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "JIT\u7f16\u8bd1\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u91ca\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u6709\u663e\u8457\u76ca\u5904\u3002"}}

At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier.

This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements. By keeping stakeholders in the validation loop, this approach promotes responsible and trustworthy use of AI in Requirements Engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8f85\u52a9\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u8868\u8fbe\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u56e0\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c40\u9650\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u626d\u66f2\u539f\u610f\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76LLMs\u652f\u6301\u9700\u6c42\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u6548\u679c\u53ca\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u9650\u8005\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "method": "\u7ec4\u7ec726\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u751f\u6210130\u6761\u9700\u6c42\u9648\u8ff0\uff0c\u5148\u72ec\u7acb\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u518d\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u4fee\u8ba2\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf9LLM\u4fee\u8ba2\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u9648\u8ff0\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u91cd\u8981\u9690\u6027\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u52a9\u5176\u66f4\u597d\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u8eab\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u91cd\u8ff0\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u4ee5\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Current terminal benchmarks were built for evaluation, not training; reinforcement learning requires a scalable pipeline, not just a dataset. We introduce Endless Terminals, a fully autonomous pipeline that procedurally generates terminal-use tasks without human annotation. The pipeline has four stages: generating diverse task descriptions, building and validating containerized environments, producing completion tests, and filtering for solvability. From this pipeline we obtain 3255 tasks spanning file operations, log management, data processing, scripting, and database operations. We train agents using vanilla PPO with binary episode level rewards and a minimal interaction loop: no retrieval, multi-agent coordination, or specialized tools. Despite this simplicity, models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains: on our held-out dev set, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 4.0% to 18.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 10.7% to 53.3%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 42.6% to 59.0%. These improvements transfer to human-curated benchmarks: models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains on held out human curated benchmarks: on TerminalBench 2.0, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 0.0% to 2.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 2.2% to 3.4%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 1.1% to 6.7%, in each case outperforming alternative approaches including models with more complex agentic scaffolds.

The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($\u03bb_{\\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($\u03bb_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $\u0394\\mathbf\u03b8$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($\u03bb_c^{1\\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale.

A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation.

While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness.

In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable.

In the age of service-orientation (a.k.a. Software as a Service (SaaS)) APIs have become core business assets and can easily expose hundreds of operations. While well-designed APIs contribute to the commercial success of a service, poorly designed APIs can threaten entire organizations. Recognizing their relevance and value, many guidelines have been proposed for designing usable APIs, similar to design patterns and coding standards. For example, Zalando and Microsoft provide popular REST API guidelines. However, they are often considered as too large and inapplicable, so many companies create and maintain their own guidelines, which is a challenge in itself. In practice, however, developers still struggle to design effective REST APIs. To improve the situation, we need to improve our empirical understanding of adopting, using, and creating REST API guidelines.\n  We present an interview study with 16 REST API experts from industry. We determine the notion of API usability, guideline effectiveness factors, challenges of adopting and designing guidelines, and best practices. We identified eight factors influencing REST API usability, among which the adherence to conventions is the most important one. While guidelines can in fact be an effective means to improve API usability, there is significant resistance from developers against strict guidelines. Guideline size and how it fits with organizational needs are two important factors to consider. REST guidelines also have to grow with the organization, while all stakeholders need to be involved in their development and maintenance. Automated linting provides an opportunity to not only embed compliance enforcement into processes, but also to justify guideline rules with educational explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8REST API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf916\u4f4d\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbf\u8c08\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u786e\u5b9aAPI\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u7b49\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u5357\u6311\u6218\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dREST API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548API\u4ecd\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u91c7\u7528\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u521b\u5efa\u6307\u5357\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5bf916\u4f4d\u884c\u4e1aREST API\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbf\u8c08\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9aAPI\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u6307\u5357\u6709\u6548\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u7b49\uff0c\u627e\u51fa\u5f71\u54cdREST API\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u516b\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u4e25\u683c\u6307\u5357\u6709\u62b5\u5236\uff0c\u6307\u5357\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5951\u5408\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9700\u6c42\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u67e5\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u5408\u89c4\u6267\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u5357\u53ef\u63d0\u5347API\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u9700\u6240\u6709\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u67e5\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the representability of floating-point transformers that use floating-point parameters and floating-point operations. Unlike existing results under exact operations, we first show that floating-point transformers can represent a class of non-permutation-equivariant functions even without positional encoding. Furthermore, we prove that floating-point transformers can represent all permutation-equivariant functions when the sequence length is bounded, but they cannot when the sequence length is large.

However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ.

While various context compression approaches such as LongLLMLingua have emerged to tackle this challenge, they typically rely on fixed metrics such as PPL, ignoring the task-specific nature of code understanding. As a result, they frequently disrupt syntactic and logical structure and fail to retain critical implementation details. In this paper, we propose SWE-Pruner, a self-adaptive context pruning framework tailored for coding agents. Drawing inspiration from how human programmers \"selectively skim\" source code during development and debugging, SWE-Pruner performs task-aware adaptive pruning for long contexts. Given the current task, the agent formulates an explicit goal (e.g., \"focus on error handling\") as a hint to guide the pruning targets. A lightweight neural skimmer (0.6B parameters) is trained to dynamically select relevant lines from the surrounding context given the goal. Evaluations across four benchmarks and multiple models validate SWE-Pruner's effectiveness in various scenarios, achieving 23-54% token reduction on agent tasks like SWE-Bench Verified and up to 14.84x compression on single-turn tasks like LongCodeQA with minimal performance impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fee\u526a\u6846\u67b6SWE - Pruner\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u4e14\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u53d7\u957f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u6613\u7834\u574f\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8c03\u8bd5\u65f6\u201c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7565\u8bfb\u201d\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0cSWE - Pruner\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u5236\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u4fee\u526a\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u7565\u8bfb\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cSWE - Pruner\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5982\u5728SWE - Bench Verified\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c1123 - 54%\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5728LongCodeQA\u5355\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe14.84\u500d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "SWE - Pruner\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fee\u526a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although both aim to ensure reliable performance, prior work has revealed a tradeoff in distribution and adversarial robustness. Specifically, adversarial training might increase reliance on spurious features, which can harm distribution robustness, especially the performance on some underrepresented subgroups. We present a theoretical analysis of adversarial and distribution robustness that provides a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data. In addition to the tradeoff, our work further identified a nuanced phenomenon that $\\ell_\\infty$ perturbations on data with moderate bias can yield an increase in distribution robustness. Moreover, the gain in distribution robustness remains on highly skewed data when simplicity bias induces reliance on the core feature, characterized as greater feature separability. Our theoretical analysis extends the understanding of the tradeoff by highlighting the interplay of the tradeoff and the feature separability.

In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines.

A prevailing hypothesis within the software engineering community suggests this code is \"disposable\", meaning it is merged quickly but discarded shortly thereafter. If true, organizations risk shifting maintenance burden from generation to post-deployment remediation. We investigate this hypothesis through survival analysis of 201 open-source projects, tracking over 200,000 code units authored by AI agents versus humans. Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p < 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cram\u00e9r's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics. The bottleneck for agent-generated code may not be generation quality, but the organizational practices that govern its long-term evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7801\u5b58\u6d3b\u66f4\u4e45\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4fee\u6539\u65f6\u673a\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u74f6\u9888\u6216\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76AI\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u201c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u201d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c06\u7ef4\u62a4\u8d1f\u62c5\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9201\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8d8520\u4e07\u4e2aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5355\u5143\u3002", "result": "AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b58\u6d3b\u66f4\u4e45\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u7387\u4f4e\uff1b\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u4f46\u6548\u5e94\u91cf\u5c0f\uff1b\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6613\u4fee\u6539\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u4fee\u6539\u65f6\u673a\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5728\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u5176\u957f\u671f\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing.

While prior studies have examined AI-generated source code, the impact of AI coding agents on build systems-a critical yet understudied component of the software lifecycle-remains largely unexplored. This data mining challenge focuses on AIDev, the first large-scale, openly available dataset capturing agent-authored pull requests (Agentic-PRs) from real-world GitHub repositories. Our paper leverages this dataset to investigate (RQ1) whether AI coding agents generate build code with quality issues (e.g., code smells), (RQ2) to what extent AI agents can eliminate code smells from build code, and (RQ3) to what extent Agentic-PRs are accepted by developers.

By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy.

To bridge this gap, we introduce M3Kang, the first massively multilingual, multimodal mathematical reasoning dataset for VLMs. It is derived from the Kangaroo Math Competition, the world's largest mathematics contest, which annually engages over six million participants under the age of 18 across more than 90 countries. M3Kang includes 1,747 unique multiple-choice problems organized by grade-level difficulty, with translations into 108 culturally diverse languages, some of them including diagrams essential for solving them. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive benchmarking on both closed- and open-source SOTA models. We observe that, despite recent advances, models still struggle with basic math and diagram-based reasoning, with performance scaling with language presence and model size, but not with grade level.

Classical work by Holmstr\u00f6m established that under pure self-interest, Nash equilibrium is universal shirking. While i* represents teams as composite actors, it lacks scalable computational mechanisms for analyzing how collective action problems emerge and resolve in coopetitive settings. This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%).

To address this challenge, we propose PyGuard, a knowledge-driven framework that converts detection failures into useful behavioral knowledge by extracting patterns from existing tools' false positives and negatives. Our method utilizes hierarchical pattern mining to identify behavioral sequences that distinguish malicious from benign code, employs Large Language Models to create semantic abstractions beyond syntactic variations, and combines this knowledge into a detection system that integrates exact pattern matching with contextual reasoning. PyGuard achieves 99.50% accuracy with only 2 false positives versus 1,927-2,117 in existing tools, maintains 98.28% accuracy on obfuscated code, and identified 219 previously unknown malicious packages in real-world deployment.

While recent advancements in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to time series modeling (TSM) have shown great promise, their effectiveness on the irregular ICU data, characterized by particularly high rates of missing values, remains largely unexplored. This work investigates two key components underlying the success of LLMs for TSM: the time series encoder and the multimodal alignment strategy. To this end, we establish a systematic testbed to evaluate their impact across various state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on benchmark ICU datasets against strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. Results reveal that the encoder design is more critical than the alignment strategy. Encoders that explicitly model irregularity achieve substantial performance gains, yielding an average AUPRC increase of $12.8\\%$ over the vanilla Transformer. While less impactful, the alignment strategy is also noteworthy, with the best-performing semantically rich, fusion-based strategy achieving a modest $2.9\\%$ improvement over cross-attention.

Existing speech-to-speech large language models either rely on ASR transcription or use encoders to extract latent representations, often weakening affective information and contextual coherence in multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we propose \\textbf{ES4R}, a framework for speech-based empathetic response generation. Our core innovation lies in explicitly modeling structured affective context before speech encoding, rather than relying on implicit learning by the encoder or explicit emotion supervision. Specifically, we introduce a dual-level attention mechanism to capture turn-level affective states and dialogue-level affective dynamics. The resulting affective representations are then integrated with textual semantics through speech-guided cross-modal attention to generate empathetic responses. For speech output, we employ energy-based strategy selection and style fusion to achieve empathetic speech synthesis.

In practice, reproducing such attacks requires manually crafting proofs-of-concept (PoCs), a labor-intensive process that demands substantial expertise and scales poorly. In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \\$0.07 per case.

To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \\textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates.

Each of these companies may choose different approaches and hardware architectures for their machines. This poses a problem for quantum software engineering, as the retargetability of quantum programs across different hardware platforms becomes a non-trivial challenge. In response to this problem, various retargetable quantum compilers have been presented in the scientific literature. These promise the ability to compile software for different hardware platforms, enabling retargetability for quantum software. In this paper, we develop and apply a metric by which the retargetability of the quantum compilers can be assessed. We develop and run a study to analyze key aspects regarding the retargetability of the compilers Tket, Qiskit, and ProjectQ. Our findings indicate that Tket demonstrates the highest level of retargetability, closely followed by Qiskit, while ProjectQ lags behind.

We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts.

We study a realistic and underexplored threat model: untargeted, audio-only adversarial attacks on trimodal audio-video-language models. We analyze six complementary attack objectives that target different stages of multimodal processing, including audio encoder representations, cross-modal attention, hidden states, and output likelihoods. Across three state-of-the-art models and multiple benchmarks, we show that audio-only perturbations can induce severe multimodal failures, achieving up to 96% attack success rate. We further show that attacks can be successful at low perceptual distortions (LPIPS <= 0.08, SI-SNR >= 0) and benefit more from extended optimization than increased data scale. Transferability across models and encoders remains limited, while speech recognition systems such as Whisper primarily respond to perturbation magnitude, achieving >97% attack success under severe distortion.

To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.\n  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent \"hot-to-cold advantage flip\" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.\n  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes.

In collaboration with the WHO and Wits University, we study how to improve the efficiency of HIV testing with the goal of eventual deployment, directly supporting progress toward UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.3. While prior work has demonstrated the promise of intelligent algorithms for sequential, network-based HIV testing, existing approaches rely on assumptions that are impractical in our real-world implementations. Here, we study sequential testing on incrementally revealed disease networks and introduce Policy-Embedded Graph Expansion (PEGE), a novel framework that directly embeds a generative distribution over graph expansions into the decision-making policy rather than attempting explicit topological reconstruction. We further propose Dynamics-Driven Branching (DDB), a diffusion-based graph expansion model that supports decision making in PEGE and is designed for data-limited settings where forest structures arise naturally, as in our real-world referral process. Experiments on real HIV transmission networks show that the combined approach (PEGE + DDB) consistently outperforms existing baselines (e.g., 13% improvement in discounted reward and 9% more HIV detections with 25% of the population tested) and explore key tradeoffs that drive decision quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6539\u8fdbHIV\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPEGE\u6846\u67b6\u548cDDB\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u652f\u6301\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u68073.3\uff0c\u4e0eWHO\u548cWits\u5927\u5b66\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbHIV\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709HIV\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u589e\u91cf\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165PEGE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDDB\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9eHIV\u4f20\u64ad\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPEGE + DDB\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5982\u6298\u6263\u5956\u52b1\u63d0\u9ad813%\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b25%\u4eba\u53e3\u65f6HIV\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u91cf\u591a9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u9884\u6d4b\u65e9\u671f\u521b\u4e1a\u516c\u53f8\u6210\u529f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fakNN - ICL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u521b\u4e1a\u516c\u53f8\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ek\u8fd1\u90bb\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6kNN - ICL\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u521b\u4e1a\u516c\u53f8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "kNN - ICL\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u666e\u901a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c50\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u98ce\u6295\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Due to its significant advantages, e.g., non-contact, radar-based respiratory monitoring has attracted widespread attention from both academia and industry. Unfortunately, though it can achieve high monitoring accuracy, consumer electronics-grade radar data inevitably contains User-sensitive Identity Information (USI), which may be maliciously used and further lead to privacy leakage. To track these challenges, by variational mode decomposition (VMD) and adversarial loss-based encryption, we propose a novel Trusted Respiratory Monitoring paradigm, Tru-RM, to perform automated respiratory monitoring through radio signals while effectively anonymizing USI. The key enablers of Tru-RM are Attribute Feature Decoupling (AFD), Flexible Perturbation Encryptor (FPE), and robust Perturbation Tolerable Network (PTN) used for attribute decomposition, identity encryption, and perturbed respiratory monitoring, respectively. Specifically, AFD is designed to decompose the raw radar signals into the universal respiratory component, the personal difference component, and other unrelated components. Then, by using large noise to drown out the other unrelated components, and the phase noise algorithm with a learning intensity parameter to eliminate USI in the personal difference component, FPE is designed to achieve complete user identity information encryption without affecting respiratory features. Finally, by designing the transferred generalized domain-independent network, PTN is employed to accurately detect respiration when waveforms change significantly. Extensive experiments based on various detection distances, respiratory patterns, and durations demonstrate the superior performance of Tru-RM on strong anonymity of USI, and high detection accuracy of perturbed respiratory waveforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTru - RM\u8303\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u96f7\u8fbe\u547c\u5438\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u76d1\u6d4b\u547c\u5438\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u654f\u611f\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u533f\u540d\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f7\u8fbe\u547c\u5438\u76d1\u6d4b\u867d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u542b\u7528\u6237\u654f\u611f\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\uff08VMD\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c5e\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\uff08AFD\uff09\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6270\u52a8\u52a0\u5bc6\u5668\uff08FPE\uff09\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6270\u52a8\u5bb9\u5fcd\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PTN\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u52a0\u5bc6\u548c\u53d7\u6270\u547c\u5438\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u547c\u5438\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTru - RM\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u654f\u611f\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u5f3a\u533f\u540d\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u53d7\u6270\u547c\u5438\u6ce2\u5f62\u6709\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "Tru - RM\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u96f7\u8fbe\u547c\u5438\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u547c\u5438\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

By eliminating materialized edge tensors and maximizing SRAM utilization, our kernel achieves a \\textbf{20$\\times$ improvement in TFLOPS} compared to standard implementations. Extensive experiments on the SPICE and OMol25 datasets demonstrate that E2Former-V2 maintains comparable predictive performance while notably accelerating inference. This work demonstrates that large equivariant transformers can be trained efficiently using widely accessible GPU platforms.

While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

In this work, we investigate whether these synthetic data generation capabilities can serve as a form of distillation, producing smaller models that perform on par with or even better than massive LLMs across languages and tasks. To this end, we use a state-of-the-art multilingual LLM to generate synthetic datasets covering 11 languages and 4 classification tasks. These datasets are then used to train smaller models via fine-tuning or instruction tuning, or as synthetic in-context examples for compact LLMs. Our experiments show that even small amounts of synthetic data enable smaller models to outperform the large generator itself, particularly in low-resource languages.

Accurate causal models provide a means to enhance the interpretability of predictive models, and furthermore a basis for counterfactual and interventional reasoning and the estimation of treatment effects. However, would-be practitioners of causal discovery face a dizzying array of algorithms without a clear best choice. This abundance of competitive algorithms makes ensembling a natural choice for practical applications. At the same time, real-world use cases frequently face challenges that violate the assumptions of common causal discovery algorithms, forcing heavy reliance on expert knowledge. Inspired by recent work on dynamically requested expert knowledge and LLMs as experts, we present a flexible model averaging method leveraging dynamically requested expert knowledge to ensemble a diverse array of causal discovery algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method with imperfect experts such as LLMs on both clean and noisy data. We also analyze the impact of different degrees of expert correctness and assess the capabilities of LLMs for clinical causal discovery, providing valuable insights for practitioners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e13\u5bb6\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f17\u591a\u65e0\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u5e38\u8fdd\u53cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u548c\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5982\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fd9\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u65f6\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

This is particularly important in cases where a large amount of exams need to be graded in a limited time frame, such as nation-wide graduation exams in various countries. Here, we examine the applicability of automated scoring on two large datasets of trial exam essays of two full national cohorts from Estonia. We operationalize the official curriculum-based rubric and compare LLM and statistical natural language processing (NLP) based assessments with human panel scores. The results show that automated scoring can achieve performance comparable to that of human raters and tends to fall within the human scoring range. We also evaluate bias, prompt injection risks, and LLMs as essay writers. These findings demonstrate that a principled, rubric-driven, human-in-the-loop scoring pipeline is viable for high-stakes writing assessment, particularly relevant for digitally advanced societies like Estonia, which is about to adapt a fully electronic examination system. Furthermore, the system produces fine-grained subscore profiles that can be used to generate systematic, personalized feedback for instruction and exam preparation.

This work introduces two modules built on top of the DMAVA: 1) a Multi-Vehicle AVP Node that performs state-based coordination, queuing, and reservation management across multiple vehicles, and 2) a Unity-Integrated YOLOv5 Parking Spot Detection Module that provides real-time, vision-based perception within AWSIM Labs. Both modules integrate seamlessly with the DMAVA and extend it specifically for multi-vehicle AVP operation, supported by a Zenoh-based communication layer that ensures low-latency topic synchronization and coordinated behavior across hosts. Experiments conducted on two- and three-host configurations demonstrate deterministic coordination, conflict-free parking behavior, and scalable performance across distributed Autoware instances. The results confirm that the proposed Distributed Multi-Vehicle AVP System supports cooperative AVP simulation and establishes a foundation for future real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

In this setting, a learner may adaptively query the oracle with any sequence of vectors and observe the corresponding real-valued output. We begin with the simplest case, a single-head softmax-attention regressor. We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \\ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance. Finally, we show that multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable from value queries in general -- distinct parameterisations can induce the same input-output map. Hence, guarantees analogous to the single-head setting are impossible without additional structural assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0bTransformer\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5355\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u5934\u90e8\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0bTransformer\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5355\u5934softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u5165\u624b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u7ed9\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u5934\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u591a\u5934\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u4e00\u822c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u503c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u7ed3\u6784\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u591a\u5934\u90e8\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5355\u5934\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Presented at the Second International Conference on Advanced Computing, Machine Learning, Robotics and Internet Technologies (AMRIT 2024)", "summary": "This study investigates regional bias in large language models (LLMs), an emerging concern in AI fairness and global representation. We evaluate ten prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.0 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3, Gemma 7B, Mistral 7B, and Vicuna-13B using a dataset of 100 carefully designed prompts that probe forced-choice decisions between regions under contextually neutral scenarios. We introduce FAZE, a prompt-based evaluation framework that measures regional bias on a 10-point scale, where higher scores indicate a stronger tendency to favor specific regions.

To mitigate this problem, we propose NOIR, the first framework to protect the client's prompts and generated code from the cloud. NOIR uses an encoder and a decoder at the client to encode and send the prompts' embeddings to the cloud to get enriched embeddings from the LLM, which are then decoded to generate the code locally at the client. Since the cloud can use the embeddings to infer the prompt and the generated code, NOIR introduces a new mechanism to achieve indistinguishability, a local differential privacy protection at the token embedding level, in the vocabulary used in the prompts and code, and a data-independent and randomized tokenizer on the client side. These components effectively defend against reconstruction and frequency analysis attacks by an honest-but-curious cloud. Extensive analysis and results using open-source LLMs show that NOIR significantly outperforms existing baselines on benchmarks, including the Evalplus (MBPP and HumanEval, Pass@1 of 76.7 and 77.4), and BigCodeBench (Pass@1 of 38.7, only a 1.77% drop from the original LLM) under strong privacy against attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNOIR\u6846\u67b6\u4fdd\u62a4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "method": "NOIR\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3001\u672c\u5730\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cNOIR\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "NOIR\u80fd\u5728\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

In medical imagining applications the most coveted property for effective deployment is Single Domain Generalization (SDG), which addresses the challenge of training a model on a single domain to ensure it generalizes well to unseen target domains. In multi-center studies, differences in scanners and imaging protocols introduce domain shifts that exacerbate variability in rare class characteristics. This paper presents our experience on SDG in real life deployment for two exemplary medical imaging case studies on seizure onset zone detection using fMRI data, and stress electrocardiogram based coronary artery detection. Utilizing the commonly used application of diabetic retinopathy, we first demonstrate that state-of-the-art SDG techniques fail to achieve generalized performance across data domains. We then develop a generic expert knowledge integrated deep learning technique DL+EKE and instantiate it for the DR application and show that DL+EKE outperforms SOTA SDG methods on DR.

We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGRIP\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230MoE\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5229\u7528\u67b6\u6784\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3001\u9020\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\u548c\u8868\u9762\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRIP\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u5173\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8def\u7531\u5668\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGRIP\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d8595%\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "GRIP\u53ef\u9632\u6b62\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5668\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u7a20\u5bc6\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\u5230MoE\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Extensive experiments on eighteen synthetic and four real-world networks using four CD methods demonstrate that ReCon consistently enhances community detection accuracy, serving as an effective and easily integrable solution for reliable CD across diverse network properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faReCon\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u7f51\u7edc\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6613\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u7f51\u7edc\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u8fb9\u7b26\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u51b2\u7a81\u5bfc\u81f4\u793e\u533a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReCon\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u5316\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u7ec6\u5316\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u56db\u4e2a\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b65\u9aa4\u9010\u6b65\u5b8c\u5584\u793e\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u572818\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u548c4\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u75284\u79cd\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cReCon\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ReCon\u662f\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u5c5e\u6027\u53ef\u9760\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6613\u96c6\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss.

Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure.

To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{\\model}, a novel RES framework integrating \\textbf{E}ntropy-\\textbf{B}ased Point \\textbf{D}iscovery (\\textbf{EBD}) and \\textbf{V}ision-\\textbf{B}ased \\textbf{R}easoning (\\textbf{VBR}). Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process. VBR verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, abandoning text-only coordinate inference for more robust validation. Built on these components, \\model implements a coarse-to-fine workflow: bounding box initialization, entropy-guided point discovery, vision-based validation, and mask decoding.

In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence.

Yet, elucidating which prior tokens most strongly influence a given prediction remains challenging due to the proliferation of layers and attention heads in modern architectures. We propose Jacobian Scopes, a suite of gradient-based, token-level causal attribution methods for interpreting LLM predictions. By analyzing the linearized relations of final hidden state with respect to inputs, Jacobian Scopes quantify how input tokens influence a model's prediction. We introduce three variants - Semantic, Fisher, and Temperature Scopes - which respectively target sensitivity of specific logits, the full predictive distribution, and model confidence (inverse temperature).

However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u826f\u6027\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u6d41\u91cf\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u7c7b\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7528LDM\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u5e73\u8861\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe0.99\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1bLDM\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea625%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u662f\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5408\u6210\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Existing methods often underperform simple baselines, fail to disentangle measurement noise from biological signal, and provide limited insight into the causal structure governing cellular responses. Here, we present the latent causal diffusion (LCD), a generative model that frames single-cell gene expression as a stationary diffusion process observed under measurement noise. LCD outperforms established approaches in predicting the distributional shifts of unseen perturbation combinations in single-cell RNA-sequencing screens while simultaneously learning a mechanistic dynamical system of gene regulation. To interpret these learned dynamics, we develop an approach we call causal linearization via perturbation responses (CLIPR), which yields an approximation of the direct causal effects between all genes modeled by the diffusion. CLIPR provably identifies causal effects under a linear drift assumption and recovers causal structure in both simulated systems and a genome-wide perturbation screen, where it clusters genes into coherent functional modules and resolves causal relationships that standard differential expression analysis cannot. The LCD-CLIPR framework bridges generative modeling with causal inference to predict unseen perturbation effects and map the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the transcriptome.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLCD\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548cCLIPR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6270\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u5e76\u7ed8\u5236\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u6270\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5982\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLCD\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u89c6\u4e3a\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u5e73\u7a33\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1CLIPR\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u57fa\u56e0\u95f4\u76f4\u63a5\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "LCD\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u7ec6\u80deRNA\u6d4b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u6270\u52a8\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u56e0\u8c03\u63a7\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1bCLIPR\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u62df\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5168\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6270\u52a8\u7b5b\u9009\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "LCD - CLIPR\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u89c1\u6270\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\u5e76\u7ed8\u5236\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format. The data are re-annotated via a multi-agent pipeline involving Qwen2 Audio, Qwen2.5 VL, and GPT 4o, producing 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEmotion - LLaMAv2\u548cMMEVerse\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u524d\u671f\u6846\u67b6Emotion - LLaMA\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEmotion - LLaMAv2\uff0c\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001Conv Attention\u9884\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u6784\u5efaMMEVerse\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u805a\u540812\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230130k\u8bad\u7ec3\u7247\u6bb5\u548c36k\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u8986\u76d618\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u53ca\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002"}}

However, this defense paradigm assumes such watermarks are inherently resistant to removal. We challenge this assumption with DeMark, a query-free black-box attack framework that targets defensive image watermarking schemes for deepfakes. DeMark exploits latent-space vulnerabilities in encoder-decoder watermarking models through a compressive sensing based sparsification process, suppressing watermark signals while preserving perceptual and structural realism appropriate for deepfakes. Across eight state-of-the-art watermarking schemes, DeMark reduces watermark detection accuracy from 100% to 32.9% on average while maintaining natural visual quality, outperforming existing attacks. We further evaluate three defense strategies, including image super resolution, sparse watermarking, and adversarial training, and find them largely ineffective.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating knowledge from external sources, thereby providing credible evidence for scientific question answering.

To support systematic evaluation, we construct SciRAG-SSLI (Scientific RAG - Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant), a large-scale dataset comprising about 300K SciQA instances across 10 subjects, constructed from 10M scientific corpus. The dataset combines naturally retrieved contexts with systematically generated distractors to test logical robustness and factual grounding.

While domain adaptation and fine-tuning are widely studied, they require either source data or labelled target data, which are often unavailable or raise privacy concerns in SER. Test-time adaptation (TTA) bridges this gap by adapting models at inference using only unlabeled target data. Yet, having been predominantly designed for image classification and speech recognition, the efficacy of TTA for mitigating the unique domain shifts in SER has not been investigated. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation and comparison covering 11 TTA methods across three representative SER tasks. The results indicate that backpropagation-free TTA methods are the most promising. Conversely, entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling generally fail, as their core assumption of a single, confident ground-truth label is incompatible with the inherent ambiguity of emotional expression. Further, no single method universally excels, and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the distributional shifts and tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf911\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08TTA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\uff08SER\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "SER\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6216\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0cTTA\u4ec5\u7528\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728SER\u4e2d\u7f13\u89e3\u72ec\u7279\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6548\u679c\u672a\u88ab\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5bf911\u79cdTTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027SER\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u65e0\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728SER\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u503c\u5f97\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e14\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, in agentic scenarios with frequent tool calls, the traditional generation-length-based definition breaks down: tool latency decouples inference time from generation length. We propose Timely Machine, redefining test-time as wall-clock time, where models dynamically adjust strategies based on time budgets. We introduce Timely-Eval, a benchmark spanning high-frequency tool calls, low-frequency tool calls, and time-constrained reasoning. By varying tool latency, we find smaller models excel with fast feedback through more interactions, while larger models dominate high-latency settings via superior interaction quality.

These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly.

Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems.

Current audits of large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on black-box evaluations that assess model behavior only through input-output testing. These methods are limited to tests constructed in the input space, often generated by heuristics. In addition, many socially relevant model properties (e.g., gender bias) are abstract and difficult to measure through text-based inputs alone. To address these limitations, we propose a white-box sensitivity auditing framework for LLMs that leverages activation steering to conduct more rigorous assessments through model internals. Our auditing method conducts internal sensitivity tests by manipulating key concepts relevant to the model's intended function for the task. We demonstrate its application to bias audits in four simulated high-stakes LLM decision tasks. Our method consistently reveals substantial dependence on protected attributes in model predictions, even in settings where standard black-box evaluations suggest little or no bias.

This paper proposes an energy-aware CPP framework grounded in Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning, designed for grid-based environments with obstacles and charging stations. To enable robust and adaptive decision-making under energy limitations, the framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dynamics. A dedicated reward function is designed to jointly optimize coverage efficiency, energy consumption, and return-to-base constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves over 90% coverage while ensuring energy safety, outperforming traditional heuristic algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) baselines by 13.4-19.5% in coverage and reducing constraint violations by 59.9-88.3%.

However, these advancements raise critical security and privacy concerns. As the adoption of bio-inspired architectures and memristive devices increases, so does the urgency to assess the vulnerability of these emerging technologies to hardware and software attacks. Emerging architectures introduce new attack surfaces, particularly due to asynchronous, event-driven processing and stochastic device behavior. The integration of memristors into neuromorphic hardware and software implementations in spiking neural networks offers diverse possibilities for advanced computing architectures, including their role in security-aware applications. This survey systematically analyzes the security landscape of neuromorphic systems, covering attack methodologies, side-channel vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. We focus on both hardware and software concerns relevant to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and hardware primitives, such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) for cryptographic and secure computation applications.

In this context, the growing interest in deploying machine learning on edge devices must be balanced against stringent constraints on computational complexity and memory while supporting high-order modulation. Beyond accurate hard detection, reliable soft information is equally critical, as modern receivers rely on soft-input channel decoding, imposing additional requirements on the detector design. In this work, we propose recurSIC, a lightweight learning-based MIMO detection framework that is structurally inspired by successive interference cancellation (SIC) and incorporates learned processing stages. It generates reliable soft information via multi-path hypothesis tracking with a tunable complexity parameter while requiring only a single forward pass and a minimal parameter count. Numerical results in realistic wireless scenarios show that recurSIC achieves strong hard- and soft-detection performance at very low complexity, making it well suited for edge-constrained MIMO receivers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u578bMIMO\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6recurSIC\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u53d7\u9650MIMO\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6MIMO\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u8f6f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u8fde\u7eed\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u542f\u53d1\u7684recurSIC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u5047\u8bbe\u8ddf\u8e2a\u751f\u6210\u8f6f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u65e0\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0crecurSIC\u5728\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u786c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f6f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "recurSIC\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u53d7\u9650\u7684MIMO\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u3002"}}

However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion.

A central practical challenge is resolving the trade-off between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism. To address inference efficiency, many recent works have explored knowledge distillation strategies specifically tailored to SR, enabling one-step diffusion-based approaches. However, these teacher-student formulations are inherently constrained by information compression, which can degrade perceptual cues such as lifelike textures and depth of field, even with high overall perceptual quality. In parallel, self-distillation DMs, known as Flow Map models, have emerged as a promising alternative for image generation tasks, enabling fast inference while preserving the expressivity and training stability of standard DMs. Building on these developments, we propose FlowMapSR, a novel diffusion-based framework for image super-resolution explicitly designed for efficient inference. Beyond adapting Flow Map models to SR, we introduce two complementary enhancements: (i) positive-negative prompting guidance, based on a generalization of classifier free-guidance paradigm to Flow Map models, and (ii) adversarial fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Among the considered Flow Map formulations (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Shortcut), we find that the Shortcut variant consistently achieves the best performance when combined with these enhancements. Extensive experiments show that FlowMapSR achieves a better balance between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism than recent state-of-the-art methods for both x4 and x8 upscaling, while maintaining competitive inference time.

Hence audio classifiers are easy to manipulate or confuse, resulting in wrong classifications. While inducing a misclassification is not hard, until now the set of features that the classifiers rely on was not well understood.\n  In this paper we introduce a new method that uses causal reasoning to discover features of the frequency space that are sufficient and necessary for a given classification. We describe an implementation of this algorithm in the tool FreqReX and provide experimental results on a number of standard benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that causally sufficient and necessary subsets allow us to manipulate the outputs of the models in a variety of ways by changing the input very slightly. Namely, a change to one out of 240,000 frequencies results in a change in classification 58% of the time, and the change can be so small that it is practically inaudible.

Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, we train linear probes across the residual stream, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and attention layers to analyze where these signals emerge. Although separability appears in the residual stream and MLPs, steering using these probes is most effective in a sparse subset of middle-layer attention heads. Using TruthfulQA as the base dataset, we find that probes trained on it transfer effectively to other factual QA benchmarks. Furthermore, comparing our discovered direction to previously identified \"truthful\" directions reveals limited overlap, suggesting that factual accuracy, and deference resistance, arise from related but distinct mechanisms. Attention-pattern analysis further indicates that the influential heads attend disproportionately to expressions of user doubt, contributing to sycophantic shifts.

However, to deliver such assistance, accurate prediction of the user's joint torques is essential. In this work, we propose a feature extraction pipeline using 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to predict elbow and shoulder joint torques. For preliminary evaluation, this pipeline was integrated into two neural network models: the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Data were collected from a single subject performing elbow and shoulder movements under three load conditions (0 kg, 1.10 kg, and 1.85 kg) using three motion-capture cameras. Reference torques were estimated from center-of-mass kinematics under the assumption of static equilibrium. Our offline analyses showed that, with our feature extraction pipeline, MLP model achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m, 1.403 N m, and 1.434 N m (over five seeds) for elbow, front-shoulder, and side-shoulder joints, respectively, which were comparable to the TCN performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to that of a network designed explicitly for temporal dependencies.

Our results suggest important novel drivers of trust in this context: familiarity emerging from personalisation, nuanced mental models of generative AI, and awareness of people's control over conversations. Notably, generative AI's homogeneous use of personalised, positive, and persuasive language appears to promote some of these trust-building factors.

Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking.

However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165PLawBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3010\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u5f8b\u57fa\u51c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5316\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaPLawBench\uff0c\u542b\u4e09\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u300113\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u3001850\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ec6\u5219\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "10\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728PLawBench\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\\% for most workspace regions. We use augmented reality targets to improve the evaluation process efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate that the agent successfully generalizes to real objects of varying colors and shapes, including LEGO\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}~cubes and a mug.

We present a probabilistic, risk-based access control architecture that couples machine learning inference with mandatory access control to regulate encryption on Linux in real time. The system builds a specialized dataset from the native ftrace framework using the function_graph tracer, yielding high-resolution kernel-function execution traces augmented with resource and I/O counters. These traces support both a supervised classifier and interpretable rules that drive an SELinux policy via lightweight booleans, enabling context-sensitive permit/deny decisions at the moment encryption begins. Compared to approaches centered on sandboxing, hypervisor introspection, or coarse system-call telemetry, the function-level tracing we adopt provides finer behavioral granularity than syscall-only telemetry while avoiding the virtualization/VMI overhead of sandbox-based approaches. Our current user-space prototype has a non-trivial footprint under burst I/O; we quantify it and recognize that a production kernel-space solution should aim to address this.

Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models. Using this new benchmark, we assessed seven state-of-the-art report generation models.

In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures.

In this work, we introduce \\textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \\emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \\textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \\emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \\emph{any} viewpoint.

We focus on two pervasive failure modes: (i) hallucinations, where models produce incorrect information about the world, and (ii) the low-resource effect, where the models show impressive performance in high-resource languages like English but the performance degrades significantly in low-resource languages like Bengali. We study the intersection of these issues and ask: do hallucination detectors suffer from the low-resource effect? We conduct experiments on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities). Experiments with four LLMs and three hallucination detectors reveal a curious finding: As expected, the task accuracies in low-resource languages experience large drops (compared to English). However, the drop in detectors' accuracy is often several times smaller than the drop in task accuracy. Our findings suggest that even in low-resource languages, the internal mechanisms of LLMs might encode signals about their uncertainty. Further, the detectors are robust within language (even for non-English) and in multilingual setups, but not in cross-lingual settings without in-language supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u53d7\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u5c0f\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u867d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u610f\u5916\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u662f\u5426\u53d7\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u5e45\u5ea6\u5c0f\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\uff0cLLMs\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u5176\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

We introduce Generative Traffic Agents (GTA) for simulating large-scale, context-sensitive transportation choices using LLM-powered, persona-based agents. GTA generates artificial populations from census-based sociodemographic data. It simulates activity schedules and mode choices, enabling scalable, human-like simulations without handcrafted rules. We evaluate GTA in Berlin-scale experiments, comparing simulation results against empirical data. While agents replicate patterns, such as modal split by socioeconomic status, they show systematic biases in trip length and mode preference.

To address these shortcomings, we propose REL-SF4PASS with our REL depth representation based on cylindrical coordinate and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion SMMF. REL is made up of Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, and Lateral Orientation Angle, which fully represents 3D space in cylindrical coordinate style and the surface normal direction.

However, prior research has pointed to the high sensitivity of T2I towards particular input languages - when faced with languages other than English (i.e., different surface forms of the same prompt), T2I models often produce culturally stereotypical depictions, prioritizing the surface over the prompt's semantics. Yet a comprehensive analysis of this behavior, which we dub Surface-over-Semantics (SoS), is missing. We present the first analysis of T2I models' SoS tendencies. To this end, we create a set of prompts covering 171 cultural identities, translated into 14 languages, and use it to prompt seven T2I models. To quantify SoS tendencies across models, languages, and cultures, we introduce a novel measure and analyze how the tendencies we identify manifest visually. We show that all but one model exhibit strong surface-level tendency in at least two languages, with this effect intensifying across the layers of T2I text encoders. Moreover, these surface tendencies frequently correlate with stereotypical visual depictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u91cd\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff08SoS\uff09\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u9996\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u5f97\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51faT2I\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6587\u5316\u523b\u677f\u63cf\u7ed8\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u91cd\u8868\u9762\u8f7b\u8bed\u4e49\uff08SoS\uff09\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u6db5\u76d6171\u79cd\u6587\u5316\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u621014\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf97\u4e2aT2I\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316SoS\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u9664\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5916\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u8868\u9762\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u5728T2I\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5404\u5c42\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u9762\u503e\u5411\u5e38\u4e0e\u523b\u677f\u89c6\u89c9\u63cf\u7ed8\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "T2I\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u8868\u9762\u8f7b\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e14\u5173\u8054\u523b\u677f\u89c6\u89c9\u63cf\u7ed8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u5584\u5176\u5bf9\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

However, predicting aesthetic experiences remains difficult due to the subjective nature of perception and the complexity of visual responses. This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5206\u652fCNN - LSTM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4f\u5b85\u5ba4\u5185\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u5ba4\u5185\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u611f\u77e5\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7f8e\u5b66\u4f53\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5206\u652fCNN - LSTM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6536\u96c6224\u4e2a\u5ba4\u5185\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c6\u9891\u53ca28\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u540c\u6b65\u6ce8\u89c6\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5ba2\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe72.2%\uff0c\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fbe66.8%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7eb3\u5165\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u5ba4\u5185\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution. Furthermore, while reasoning-augmented inference improves performance, its marginal benefit per token decreases with distributional proximity.

We found that these relationships took varied forms, from one-to-one to one-to-many, and were shaped by multiple actors, including creators, platforms, and moderators.

Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding.

In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools.

Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance.

While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay.

While global toolkits such as IBM AI Fairness 360 and Microsoft Fairlearn have advanced bias detection, they often lack alignment with region-specific regulatory requirements and national priorities. To address this gap, we propose Nishpaksh, an indigenous fairness evaluation tool that operationalizes the Telecommunication Engineering Centre (TEC) Standard for the Evaluation and Rating of Artificial Intelligence Systems. Nishpaksh integrates survey-based risk quantification, contextual threshold determination, and quantitative fairness evaluation into a unified, web-based dashboard. The tool employs vectorized computation, reactive state management, and certification-ready reporting to enable reproducible, audit-grade assessments, thereby addressing a critical post-standardization implementation need. Experimental validation on the COMPAS dataset demonstrates Nishpaksh's effectiveness in identifying attribute-specific bias and generating standardized fairness scores compliant with the TEC framework.

To quantify any potential reflection biases, we introduce a permutation-based evaluation framework. With this, we observe that state-of-the-art embedding models exhibit systematic positional and language biases when documents are longer and consist of multiple segments. Specifically, early segments and segments in higher-resource languages like English are over-represented, while later segments and segments in lower-resource languages are marginalized. In our further analysis, we find that the positional bias stems from front-loaded attention distributions in pooling-token embeddings, where early tokens receive more attention. To mitigate this issue, we introduce an inference-time attention calibration method that redistributes attention more evenly across document positions, increasing discoverabiltiy of later segments.
