Yet\nmost LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success\ncriteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving\nuncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of\nthe same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which\nLMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer\nreliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these\npriors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to\nsamples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we\nfind that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.\nPerformance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the\nmodel, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning\neffort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging\nevaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are\nbetter at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165OpenEstimate\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u542b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165OpenEstimate\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u516d\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u51fa\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u5c0f\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53d7\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u52aa\u529b\u6216\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "OpenEstimate\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

In this\nstudy, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system\ncomprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating\nisland agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects\n(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The\nhummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm\nfrom the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain\nefficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the\never-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained\nusing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate\nflower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial\nstate, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between\nthese agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across\nvarious environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach\nnot only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new\nopportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning.

We present Hive hash table, a\nhigh-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table\nthat adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.\n  Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed\nbucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory\naccess and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous\nconcurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and\nWarp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic\noperation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a\nload-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in\nwarp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced\noccupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs\na four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and\noverflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded\nrecovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while\neliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.\n  Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains\nload factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than\nstate-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed\ninsert-delete-lookup workloads.

However, completing a\nphysical assessment is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality raw data\nand poor harmonization across industry classification systems used in data\nreporting. Here we describe a new physical extension for the U.S. Department of\nEnergy's (DOE's) EEIO for Industrial Decarbonization (EEIO-IDA) model, yielding\nan expanded EEIO model that is both physically and environmentally extended. In\nthe model framework, the U.S. economy is divided into goods-producing and\nservice-producing subsectors, and mass flows are quantified for each\ngoods-producing subsector using a combination of trade data (e.g., UN Comtrade)\nand physical production data (e.g., U.S. Geological Survey). Given that\nprimary-source production data are not available for all subsectors,\nprice-imputation and mass-balance assumptions are developed and used to\ncomplete the physical flows dataset with high-quality estimations. The\nresulting dataset, when integrated with the EEIO-IDA tool, enables the\nquantification of environmental impact intensity metrics on a mass basis (e.g.,\nCO$_2$eq/kg)) for each industrial subsector.

Current parallel execution frameworks either\nrely on optimistic concurrency control (OCC) or on pessimistic concurrency\ncontrol (PCC), both of which see their performance decrease when workloads are\nhighly contended, albeit for different reasons. In this work, we present NEMO,\na new blockchain execution engine that combines OCC with the object data model\nto address this challenge. NEMO introduces four core innovations: (i) a greedy\ncommit rule for transactions using only owned objects; (ii) refined handling of\ndependencies to reduce re-executions; (iii) the use of incomplete but\nstatically derivable read/write hints to guide execution; and (iv) a\npriority-based scheduler that favors transactions that unblock others.

This paper investigates how insurers' robustness preferences shape\ncompetitive equilibrium in a dynamic insurance market. Insurers optimize their\nunderwriting and liquidity management strategies to maximize shareholder value,\nleading to equilibrium outcomes that can be analytically derived and\nnumerically solved. Compared to a benchmark without model uncertainty, robust\ninsurance pricing results in significantly higher premiums and equity\nvaluations. Notably, our model yields three novel insights: (1) The minimum,\nmaximum, and admissible range of aggregate capacity all expand, indicating that\ninsurers' liquidity management becomes more conservative.

In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nestimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing\nricher information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL\nalgorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the\ndistribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause\nproblems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with\ndifferent distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.\nThis study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy\nQ-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax\ncalculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather\nthan relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions\nhave similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing\npolicies.

The seller has access to the\nunderlying state of the world that determines the utility of the various\nactions the buyer may take. Since the buyer gains greater utility through\nbetter decisions resulting from more accurate assessments of the state, the\nseller can therefore promise the buyer supplemental information at a price. To\ncontend with the fact that the seller may not be perfectly informed about the\nbuyer's private preferences (or utility), we frame the problem of designing a\ndata product as one where the seller designs a revenue-maximizing menu of\nstatistical experiments.\n  Prior work by Cai et al. showed that an optimal menu can be found in time\npolynomial in the state space, whereas we observe that the state space is\nnaturally exponential in the dimension of the data. We propose an algorithm\nwhich, given only sampling access to the state space, provably generates a\nnear-optimal menu with a number of samples independent of the state space. We\nthen analyze a special case of high-dimensional Gaussian data, showing that (a)\nit suffices to consider scalar Gaussian experiments, (b) the optimal menu of\nsuch experiments can be found efficiently via a semidefinite program, and (c)\nfull surplus extraction occurs if and only if a natural separation condition\nholds on the set of potential preferences of the buyer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u6570\u636e\u552e\u5356\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u4ec5\u80fd\u91c7\u6837\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u83dc\u5355\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u552e\u5356\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u5bf9\u5356\u5bb6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4e86\u89e3\u4e70\u5bb6\u504f\u597d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u751f\u6210\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u83dc\u5355\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u83dc\u5355\uff1b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6807\u91cf\u9ad8\u65af\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u83dc\u5355\uff0c\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u5269\u4f59\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u601d\u8def\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches typically rely on a\nsingle selected portfolio, but this fails to consider alternative investment\nstrategies that may perform just as well when accounting for statistical\nuncertainty. To address this selection uncertainty, we introduce the Selection\nConfidence Set (SCS) for EWPs: the set of all portfolios that, under a given\nloss function and at a specified confidence level, contains the unknown set of\noptimal portfolios under repeated sampling. The SCS quantifies selection\nuncertainty by identifying a range of plausible portfolios, challenging the\nidea of a uniquely optimal choice. Like a confidence set, its size reflects\nuncertainty -- growing with noisy or limited data, and shrinking as the sample\nsize increases. Theoretically, we establish that the SCS covers the unknown\noptimal selection with high probability and characterize how its size grows\nwith underlying uncertainty, corroborating these results through Monte Carlo\nexperiments.

The\nalgorithm establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable and\nenergy-efficient underwater swarm robotics with validated performance analysis.\nValidation studies demonstrate an 86% success rate for permanent anchoring\nscenarios, providing a unified formulation for hydrodynamic constraints and\nirreversible settlement behaviours with an empirical study under flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNOAH\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6c34\u4e0b\u81ea\u4e3b\u822a\u884c\u5668\u73b0\u6709\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6c34\u4e0b\u5f3a\u6d41\u3001\u6709\u9650\u58f0\u5b66\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u611f\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u85e4\u58f6\u65e0\u8282\u5e7c\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u7684NOAH\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u611f\u77e5\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u6c38\u4e45\u611f\u77e5\u8282\u70b9\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6c89\u964d\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u6c38\u4e45\u951a\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe86%\uff0c\u5728\u6d41\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6c89\u964d\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u7fa4\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

If we are given a graph and want to\nfind a locally maximal cut--meaning that the number of edges in the cut cannot\nbe improved by moving a single vertex from one side to the other--then just\niterating improving steps finds a local maximum since the size of the cut can\nincrease at most $|E|$ times. If, on the other hand, the edges are weighted,\nthis problem becomes hard for the class PLS (Polynomial Local Search)[16].\n  We are interested in optimization problems with lexicographic costs. For\nMax-Cut this would mean that the edges $e_1,\\dots, e_m$ have costs $c(e_i) =\n2^{m-i}$. For such a cost function, it is easy to see that finding a global\nMax-Cut is easy.

Managing these embedding sizes can be\nchallenging, leading to bulky models that are harder to deploy and maintain. In\nthis paper, we introduce a method to automatically determine the optimal\nembedding size for ID features, significantly reducing the model size while\nmaintaining performance.\n  Our approach involves defining a custom Keras layer called the dimension mask\nlayer, which sits directly after the embedding lookup. This layer trims the\nembedding vector by allowing only the first N dimensions to pass through.

However, existing speech therapy solutions\n(e.g., therapist or tools) are still limited and costly, hence such solutions\nremain inadequate for serving millions of patients worldwide.

Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeVox achieves\n88% confidence level on average in speech disorder recognition, while providing\na complete feedback for therapy exercises.

To address these limitations, this study\nproposes a process-aware framework that enhances FMEA reusability by combining\nmanufacturing-domain conceptualization with graph neural network (GNN)\nreasoning. First, FMEA worksheets from multiple manufacturing lines are\ntransformed into a unified knowledge graph through ontology-guided large\nlanguage model (LLM) extraction, capturing domain concepts such as actions,\nstates, components, and parameters. Second, a Relational Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (RGCN) with the process-aware scoring function learns embeddings that\nrespect both semantic relationships and sequential process flows.

Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and\ndata during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow\ntrajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based\nmethods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data\npoints, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets\nin FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages\nSemi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by\nestablishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data\npoints with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by\npartitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a\ncorresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired\nwith data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and\nmodel architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental\nresults show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of\nstate-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play\ncomponent.

While large language\nmodels (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised\nfinetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a\nnew bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.\nExisting selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$\ndecoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent\nscoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained\nsemantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we\nintroduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate\nselection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament\nmechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills\nreasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,\nenabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted\nconsensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit\ngenerator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more\nefficient.

However, reviewers often work\nunder time pressure and rely primarily on static inspection, leaving the\ndynamic aspects of the program unexplored. Dynamic analyses could reveal such\nbehaviors, but they are rarely integrated into reviews. Among them, fuzzing is\ntypically applied later to uncover crashing bugs. Yet its ability to exercise\ncode with diverse inputs makes it promising for exposing non-crashing, but\nunexpected, behaviors earlier. Still, without suitable mechanisms to analyze\nprogram behaviors, the rich data produced during fuzzing remains inaccessible\nto reviewers, limiting its practical value in this context.\n  We hypothesize that unexpected variations in program behaviors could signify\npotential bugs. The impact of code changes can be automatically captured at\nruntime. Representing program behavior as likely invariants, dynamic properties\nconsistently observed at specific program points, can provide practical signals\nof behavioral changes. Such signals offer a way to distinguish between intended\nchanges and unexpected behavioral shifts from code changes.\n  We present FuzzSight, a framework that leverages likely invariants from\nnon-crashing fuzzing inputs to highlight behavioral differences across program\nversions. By surfacing such differences, it provides insights into which code\nblocks may need closer attention. In our evaluation, FuzzSight flagged 75% of\nregression bugs and up to 80% of vulnerabilities uncovered by 24-hour fuzzing.\nIt also outperformed SAST in identifying buggy code blocks, achieving ten times\nhigher detection rates with fewer false alarms.

To ensure faithfulness and traceability, SQuAI\nintegrates in-line citations for each generated claim and provides supporting\nsentences from the source documents. Our system improves faithfulness, answer\nrelevance, and contextual relevance by up to +0.088 (12%) over a strong RAG\nbaseline. We further release a benchmark of 1,000 scientific\nquestion-answer-evidence triplets to support reproducibility. With transparent\nreasoning, verifiable citations, and domain-wide scalability, SQuAI\ndemonstrates how multi-agent RAG enables more trustworthy scientific QA with\nLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdSQuAI\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u672f\u9886\u57dfRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u51c6\u786e\u56de\u7b54\u3001\u5e26\u5f15\u7528\u58f0\u660e\u53ca\u8de8\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e230\u591a\u4e07\u7bc7arXiv.org\u5168\u6587\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u7a00\u758f - \u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u884c\u5185\u5f15\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684RAG\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u7b54\u6848\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0a\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u53470.088\uff0812%\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u5e031000\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54 - \u8bc1\u636e\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "SQuAI\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53RAG\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u3002"}}

If the sum of their tokens is odd, the node to receive\nthe one excess token is selected at random. Our class covers three popular\nmodels: in the matching model a new matching is generated randomly in each\nround, in the balancing circuit model a fixed sequence of matchings is applied\nperiodically, and in the asynchronous model the load is balanced over a\nrandomly chosen edge.\n  We measure the quality of a load vector by its discrepancy, defined as the\ndifference between the maximum and minimum load across all nodes. As our main\nresult we show that with high probability our discrete balancing scheme reaches\na discrepancy of $3$ in a number of rounds which asymptotically matches the\nspectral bound for continuous load balancing with fractional load.\n  This result improves and tightens a long line of previous works, by not only\nachieving a small constant discrepancy (instead of a non-explicit, large\nconstant) but also holding for arbitrary instead of regular graphs.

Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by\ntask-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to\nground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,\nvanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability\nthat at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across\ntraining steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.\nInspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping\nLLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with\nenvironmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this\nworld model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and\ntransition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement\nlearning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised\nfinetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the\nenvironment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy\noptimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling\nbaseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.\nExperiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku\nshow that our approach significantly improves performance.

In the 1980s,\nRobert Axelrod organized two influential IPD computer tournaments, where Tit\nfor Tat (TFT) emerged as the winner. Yet the archival record is incomplete: for\nthe first tournament only a report survives, and for the second the submitted\nFortran strategies remain but not the final tournament code. This gap raises\nquestions about the reproducibility of these historically influential results.\nWe recreate the second tournament by restoring the surviving Fortran\nimplementations to compile with modern compilers and by building a Python\ninterface that calls the original strategy functions without modification.\nUsing the open-source Axelrod-Python library to run tournaments, we reproduce\nAxelrod's main findings: TFT prevails, and successful play tends to be\ncooperative, responsive to defection, and willing to forgive. Strategy rankings\nremain mostly unchanged. We then assess the robustness of the originally\nsubmitted strategies by incorporating additional strategies, and we run one of\nthe largest IPD tournaments to date.

A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is\nthat they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains\nthey were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR\nincorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer\nlayer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of\nadditional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which\nintroduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To\nassess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical\nevaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation\nsetups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot\ngeneralizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different\nunderlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective\ntest sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform\nzero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform\nfurther experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters\n(i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this\nvariation affects SB-MoE's performance.

While recent work on LLM-assisted scientific literature\nanalysis supports literature comparison, existing approaches offer limited\ntransparency and lack mechanisms for result traceability via an information\nretrieval module. To address this gap, we introduce $\\textbf{GraphMind}$, an\neasy-to-use interactive web tool designed to assist users in evaluating the\nnovelty of scientific papers or drafted ideas. Specially, $\\textbf{GraphMind}$\nenables users to capture the main structure of a scientific paper, explore\nrelated ideas through various perspectives, and assess novelty via providing\nverifiable contextual insights. $\\textbf{GraphMind}$ enables users to annotate\nkey elements of a paper, explore related papers through various relationships,\nand assess novelty with contextual insight. This tool integrates external APIs\nsuch as arXiv and Semantic Scholar with LLMs to support annotation, extraction,\nretrieval and classification of papers. This combination provides users with a\nrich, structured view of a scientific idea's core contributions and its\nconnections to existing work. $\\textbf{GraphMind}$ is available at\nhttps://oyarsa.github.io/graphmind and a demonstration video at\nhttps://youtu.be/wKbjQpSvwJg.

To localize the root cause of performance\ndegradation in these environments, constructing a service dependency graph is\nhighly beneficial. However, building an accurate service dependency graph is\nimpaired by complex routing techniques, such as Network Address Translation\n(NAT), an essential mechanism for connecting services across networks.

To this end, this paper introduces XXXX, a\nnovel run-time system for constructing process-level service dependency graphs.\nIt operates without source code instrumentation and remains resilient under\ncomplex network routing mechanisms, including NAT. XXXX implements a\nnon-disruptive method of injecting metadata onto a TCP packet's header that\nmaintains protocol correctness across host boundaries. In other words, if no\nreceiving agent is present, the instrumentation leaves existing TCP connections\nunaffected, ensuring non-disruptive operation when it is partially deployed\nacross hosts. We evaluated XXXX extensively against three state-of-the-art\nsystems across nine scenarios, involving three network configurations\n(NAT-free, internal-NAT, external-NAT) and three microservice benchmarks.

In the literature, most existing methods estimate\npixel-wise class probabilities, then apply argmax or thresholding to obtain the\nfinal prediction. These methods have been shown to generally lead to\ninconsistent or suboptimal results, as they do not directly maximize\nsegmentation metrics. To address this issue, a novel consistent segmentation\nframework, RankSEG, has been proposed, which includes RankDice and RankIoU\nspecifically designed to optimize the Dice and IoU metrics, respectively.\nAlthough RankSEG almost guarantees improved performance, it suffers from two\nmajor drawbacks. First, it is its computational expense-RankDice has a\ncomplexity of O(d log d) with a substantial constant factor (where d represents\nthe number of pixels), while RankIoU exhibits even higher complexity O(d^2),\nthus limiting its practical application. For instance, in LiTS, prediction with\nRankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule.\nSecond, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where\nmultiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard\nbenchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation. In this paper,\nwe overcome these two drawbacks via a reciprocal moment approximation (RMA) of\nRankSEG with the following contributions: (i) we improve RankSEG using RMA,\nnamely RankSEG-RMA, reduces the complexity of both algorithms to O(d) while\nmaintaining comparable performance; (ii) inspired by RMA, we develop a\npixel-wise score function that allows efficient implementation for\nnon-overlapping segmentation settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0cRankSEG\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5c40\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7528RMA\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3RankSEG\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u53e0\u5206\u5272\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9RankSEG\u8fdb\u884c\u4e92\u60e0\u77e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff08RMA\uff09\uff0c\u5f97\u5230RankSEG - RMA\uff1b\u53d7RMA\u542f\u53d1\u5f00\u53d1\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5c06RankSEG\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u5230O(d)\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7RMA\u6539\u8fdbRankSEG\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5176\u539f\u6709\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002"}}

Funky offers primary orchestration services for FPGA\nworkloads to achieve high performance, utilization, scalability, and fault\ntolerance, accomplished by three contributions: (1) FPGA virtualization for\nlightweight sandboxes, (2) FPGA state management enabling task preemption and\ncheckpointing, and (3) FPGA-aware orchestration components following the\nindustry-standard CRI/OCI specifications.\n  We implement and evaluate Funky using four x86 servers with Alveo U50 FPGA\ncards.

We are the\nfirst to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)\ntask. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural\nhomogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which\nchallenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in\neffectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval\nmechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM\nintroduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates\ndynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from\nspecific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning\nof drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between\nwords and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction\nmodule, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic\nterm to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and\nimprove the robustness of feature representation.

The core\nidea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a\ndata-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal\noperator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from\nthe empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest\nfeq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional\nsubspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse\nstructure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and\nre-normalizing yields a valid PMF.\n  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the\ncomputation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support\ntimes the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a\npractical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an\northogonal-series risk estimate, so the method \"just works\" with minimal\ntuning.

Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men\nStudy (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,\nStage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to\nestimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived\nfeatures for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal\nand external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across\ncohorts.

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied\nto its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from\nunsound ones.

Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set\naround the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes\nworst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian\nsearch. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution\nshift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the\ninstruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality\nrewriting, code debugging, and translation.

In this study, we propose a novel\nmachine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional\nensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).\nSpecifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate\npreliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF.

We evaluate the\nperformance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments\ninvolving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The\nresults consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy\nthan traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible\nadditional computational cost.

Operator theory\nviews such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding\nvectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked\nperspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an\noperator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of\nmaterializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as\na tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To\novercome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we\nintroduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core\nconcepts.

However, increasing model depth comes with challenges\nsuch as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on\nresource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a\nshallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both\nstructure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function\napproximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their\nperformance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,\nrather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration\nthrough sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not\ninherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential\nconstraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer\ncollaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive\napproximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from\npreceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate\nParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.\nMoreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates\nmodel expansion for adaptive continuous learning.

Framed through the unifying\nperspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application\ndomains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The\nfirst part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in\nranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to\na counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not\nto underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee\nis extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial\nor misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over\npermissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where\nvarious off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction\nframework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise\nboth evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy\nlearning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency\nand effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE\nmotivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple\ndiffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped\nobjective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing\ngenerations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u505a\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u6392\u5e8f\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5LOOP\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u5bfc\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u5728\u5355\u52a8\u4f5c\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u5c06\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u57fa\u7ebf\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u7814\u7a76PPO\u548cREINFORCE\u63d0\u51faLOOP\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f4e\u4e8e\u65e5\u5fd7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u53cc\u91cd\u7a33\u5065\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1b\u5728\u5355\u52a8\u4f5c\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\uff1bLOOP\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230PPO\u7ea7\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

A prevalent approach\nwithin the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance\nreasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during\ninference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations\nremain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework\nfor analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the\nperspective of confidence estimation.

To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a\nhybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key\ncomponents: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity\nConsistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting\nthe convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while\npreserving model error.

Both theoretical analysis and empirical\nresults across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong\npotential for reducing reasoning error.

While this choice is intensely debated, its\nunderlying economic drivers remain underexplored. We construct a two-period\ngame-theoretic model to analyze how openness shapes competition in an AI value\nchain, featuring an incumbent developer, a downstream deployer, and an entrant\ndeveloper. Openness exerts a dual effect: it amplifies knowledge spillovers to\nthe entrant, but it also enhances the incumbent's advantage through a \"data\nflywheel effect,\" whereby greater user engagement today further lowers the\ndeployer's future fine-tuning cost. Our analysis reveals that the incumbent's\noptimal first-period openness is surprisingly non-monotonic in the strength of\nthe data flywheel effect. When the data flywheel effect is either weak or very\nstrong, the incumbent prefers a higher level of openness; however, for an\nintermediate range, it strategically restricts openness to impair the entrant's\nlearning. This dynamic gives rise to an \"openness trap,\" a critical policy\nparadox where transparency mandates can backfire by removing firms' strategic\nflexibility, reducing investment, and lowering welfare. We extend the model to\nshow that other common interventions can be similarly ineffective. Vertical\nintegration, for instance, only benefits the ecosystem when the data flywheel\neffect is strong enough to overcome the loss of a potentially more efficient\ncompetitor. Likewise, government subsidies intended to spur adoption can be\ncaptured entirely by the incumbent through strategic price and openness\nadjustments, leaving the rest of the value chain worse off.

Among various attack strategies, Universal\nAdversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both\nstress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.\nDespite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific\nconstraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such\nas debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network\ncommunication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily\ndetectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.\n  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature\nspaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization\nproblem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying\nimportance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient\nalgorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating\noptimization strategy.

Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods\ntypically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this\nassumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations.\nWe propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs\nbased on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of\ntext discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous\nperturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies\ncontrolled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential\nrobustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers\nare collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and\nrobust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is\napplied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness\n(WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal\nprobability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing\nprovides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by\nensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space\nperturbations.

Furthermore, existing pixel-space\nvideo reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video\nto acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of\nrigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to\nperform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To\naddress this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive\nframework built upon our core philosophy: \"Select Less, Reason More.\" Our core\ncontribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,\nwhich transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is\nprecisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,\ncrucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to\naccess fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding\nvideo reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new\nstate-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an\neffective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy.

It operates by\nre-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and\nthen uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for\nspeculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched\nvocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and\nmodification.

The\ndataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing\nclapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,\nlocation, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated\nframes and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and\n1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic\ncategory, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as\nrotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially\nprecise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant\nchallenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure\nfluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in\nhistorical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,\nnon-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word\nimages to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation\nprotocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection\nmodels under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training\nset (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,\nhighlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios.

Here, we investigate nonlinear dimensionality\nreduction techniques that reduce the problem to a sequence of low-dimensional\nLatent-Space BO (LSBO). While early LSBO methods used (linear) random\nprojections (Wang et al., 2013), building on Grosnit et al. (2021), we employ\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs) for LSBO, focusing on deep metric loss for\nstructured latent manifolds and VAE retraining to adapt the encoder-decoder to\nnewly sampled regions. We propose some changes in their implementation,\noriginally designed for tasks such as molecule generation, and reformulate the\nalgorithm for broader optimisation purposes. We then couple LSBO with\nSequential Domain Reduction (SDR) directly in the latent space (SDR-LSBO),\nyielding an algorithm that narrows the latent search domains as evidence\naccumulates. Implemented in a GPU-accelerated BoTorch stack with Matern-5/2\nGaussian process surrogates, our numerical results show improved optimisation\nquality across benchmark tasks and that structured latent manifolds improve BO\nperformance. Additionally, we compare random embeddings and VAEs as two\nmechanisms for dimensionality reduction, showing that the latter outperforms\nthe former.

However, existing detection methods are primarily\ndesigned to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect\nthese implicit cues.

In these areas, models\nbenefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based\nobjectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in\nopen-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or\ncontext-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably\nmedical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas\nchallenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT,\nan open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed\nfor high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue\ngeneration with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to\ndirect an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend\non external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided\nfeedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model,\nour method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard\nbenchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving\nstate-of-the-art results for models of this scale.
