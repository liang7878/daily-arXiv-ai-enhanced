To overcome these challenges, we propose a\nwavelet-optimized end-to-end framework for 3D MRI motion correct using\npre-trained 2D score priors (3D-WMoCo). Specifically, two orthogonal 2D score\npriors are leveraged to guide the 3D distribution prior, while a mean-reverting\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) is employed to model the restoration\nprocess of motion-corrupted 3D volumes to motion-free 3D distribution.\nFurthermore, wavelet diffusion is introduced to accelerate inference, and\nwavelet convolution is applied to enhance feature extraction.

By integrating symbolic\nknowledge with user-item interactions, KGs enrich semantic representations,\nsupport reasoning, and enhance model interpretability. Despite this potential,\nexisting KG-based methods still face major challenges in CDR, particularly\nunder non-overlapping user scenarios. These challenges arise from: (C1)\nsensitivity to KG sparsity and popularity bias, (C2) dependence on overlapping\nusers for domain alignment and (C3) lack of explicit disentanglement between\ntransferable and domain-specific knowledge, which limit effective and stable\nknowledge transfer. To this end, we propose KGBridge, a knowledge-guided prompt\nlearning framework for cross-domain sequential recommendation under\nnon-overlapping user scenarios. KGBridge comprises two core components: a\nKG-enhanced Prompt Encoder, which models relation-level semantics as soft\nprompts to provide structured and dynamic priors for user sequence modeling\n(addressing C1), and a Two-stage Training Paradigm, which combines cross-domain\npretraining and privacy-preserving fine-tuning to enable knowledge transfer\nwithout user overlap (addressing C2). By combining relation-aware semantic\ncontrol with correspondence-driven disentanglement, KGBridge explicitly\nseparates and balances domain-shared and domain-specific semantics, thereby\nmaintaining complementarity and stabilizing adaptation during fine-tuning\n(addressing C3). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nKGBridge consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and remains robust\nunder varying KG sparsity, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating\nstructural imbalance and semantic entanglement in KG-enhanced cross-domain\nrecommendation."}

PID decomposes the contribution of\ndifferent inputs to an output into unique information from each input,\nredundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges\nfrom combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons\nin classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the\ninformation in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between\nthe external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and\nunique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and\nperformance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as\nan information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each\nneuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more\nthan tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks\nand even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield\nnetworks.

However, assurance cases often tend\nto be organized as extensive documents spanning hundreds of pages, making their\ncreation, review, and maintenance error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious.\nTherefore, there is a growing need to leverage (semi-)automated techniques,\nsuch as those powered by generative AI and large language models (LLMs), to\nenhance efficiency, consistency, and accuracy across the entire assurance-case\nlifecycle. In this paper, we focus on assurance case review, a critical task\nthat ensures the quality of assurance cases and therefore fosters their\nacceptance by regulatory authorities. We propose a novel approach that\nleverages the \\textit{LLM-as-a-judge} paradigm to automate the review process.\nSpecifically, we propose new predicate-based rules that formalize\nwell-established assurance case review criteria, allowing us to craft LLM\nprompts tailored to the review task. Our experiments on several\nstate-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) show\nthat, while most LLMs yield relatively good review capabilities, DeepSeek-R1\nand GPT-4.1 demonstrate superior performance, with DeepSeek-R1 ultimately\noutperforming GPT-4.1. However, our experimental results also suggest that\nhuman reviewers are still needed to refine the reviews LLMs yield."}

Github\n  repo: https://github.com/mm4963/prior-guided-EHR-phenotyping/tree/main", "summary": "Objectives: Unsupervised learning with electronic health record (EHR) data\nhas shown promise for phenotype discovery, but approaches typically disregard\nexisting clinical information, limiting interpretability. We operationalize a\nBayesian latent class framework for phenotyping that incorporates\ndomain-specific knowledge to improve clinical meaningfulness of EHR-derived\nphenotypes and illustrate its utility by identifying an asthma sub-phenotype\ninformed by features of Type 2 (T2) inflammation.\n  Materials and methods: We illustrate a framework for incorporating clinical\nknowledge into a Bayesian latent class model via informative priors to guide\nunsupervised clustering toward clinically relevant subgroups. This approach\nmodels missingness, accounting for potential missing-not-at-random patterns,\nand provides patient-level probabilities for phenotype assignment with\nuncertainty. Using reusable and flexible code, we applied the model to a large\nasthma EHR cohort, specifying informative priors for T2 inflammation-related\nfeatures and weakly informative priors for other clinical variables, allowing\nthe data to inform posterior distributions.\n  Results and Conclusion: Using encounter data from January 2017 to February\n2024 for 44,642 adult asthma patients, we found a bimodal posterior\ndistribution of phenotype assignment, indicating clear class separation. The T2\ninflammation-informed class (38.7%) was characterized by elevated eosinophil\nlevels and allergy markers, plus high healthcare utilization and medication\nuse, despite weakly informative priors on the latter variables. These patterns\nsuggest an \"uncontrolled T2-high\" sub-phenotype. This demonstrates how our\nBayesian latent class modeling approach supports hypothesis generation and\ncohort identification in EHR-based studies of heterogeneous diseases without\nwell-established phenotype definitions."}

To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference.

However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth\nstate sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nmethod that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian\nffltering methods, enabling\n  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics\ndirectly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.\nSpeciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation\nof surrogate model parameters\n  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a\ndiscretetime\n  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate\ntransition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which\ncan be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the\nmodel is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage\nusing ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework\naccommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and\npartially observed measurement\n  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings."}

Yet, the\nlocal computational principles which are required to enable this function\nremain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information\nprocessing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory\n- Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of\ndifferent inputs to an output into unique information from each input,\nredundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges\nfrom combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons\nin classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the\ninformation in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between\nthe external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and\nunique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and\nperformance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as\nan information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each\nneuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more\nthan tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks\nand even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield\nnetworks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new\ndesign principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new\nassociative memory models based on information-theoretic goals."}

We\nformalize model exfiltration as a security game, propose a verification\nframework that can provably mitigate steganographic exfiltration, and specify\nthe trust assumptions associated with our scheme. To enable verification, we\ncharacterize valid sources of non-determinism in large language model inference\nand introduce two practical estimators for them. We evaluate our detection\nframework on several open-weight models ranging from 3B to 30B parameters. On\nMOE-Qwen-30B, our detector reduces exfiltratable information to <0.5% with\nfalse-positive rate of 0.01%, corresponding to a >200x slowdown for\nadversaries.

To address these, we propose Federated Attention\n(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention\nmechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and\ncomputational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local\nself-attention over their own token representations while periodically\nexchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer\nblocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private\nprompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual\nrepresentation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across\nprivate data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight\nprovides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated\noptimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this\nframework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within\nparticipants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error\npropagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the\nfundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation\nefficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of\nparticipants.

However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained.
