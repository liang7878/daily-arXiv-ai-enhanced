The Reuse Distance Histogram (RDH) is\na widely used metric to quantify temporal locality, measuring the distance\nbetween consecutive accesses to the same memory location. Traditionally,\ncalculating RDH requires program execution and memory trace collection to\nobtain dynamic memory access behavior. This trace collection is often\ntime-consuming, resource-intensive, and unsuitable for early-stage optimization\nor large-scale applications. Static prediction, on the other hand, offers a\nsignificant speedup in estimating RDH and cache hit rates. However, these\napproaches lack accuracy, since the predictions come without running the\nprogram and knowing the complete memory access pattern, more specifically when\narrays are used inside nested loops. This paper presents a novel static\nanalysis framework for predicting the reuse profiles of array references in\nprograms with nested loop structures, without requiring any runtime\ninformation. By analyzing loop bounds, access patterns in smaller problem\nsizes, and predictive equations, our method predicts access patterns of arrays\nand estimates reuse distances and cache hit rate at compile time.

Using data from the RAND version of the Health and Retirement Study\n(HRS), a nationally representative longitudinal panel of U.S. adults over age\n50, covering the years 2010 to 2022, I estimate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)\nand Instrumental Variables (IV) models to address potential endogeneity in\ncaregiving decisions. The number of children is employed as an instrument for\ninformal care intensity. While OLS estimates suggest a negative association\nbetween informal caregiving and cognition, IV estimates show no significant\ncausal effect after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and lagged\ncognition variables. In contrast, IV results indicate that informal care\nsignificantly reduces the likelihood of nursing home use, the number of\ninstitutional nights, and the probability of institutionalization. No robust\ncausal effects are found for hospital use, doctor visits, or outpatient\nsurgery, although there is some suggestive evidence of a complementary\nrelationship between informal care and home health services. These findings\nhighlight the role of informal caregiving in substituting for institutional\ncare and underscore its importance in long-term care policy for dementia\npatients.

To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a\nmulti-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow\nfrom a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical\ngaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation:\nFoam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline,\nincluding advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of\nhandling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic\ngeneration of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via\nParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent,\nthe framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as\ndiscrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other\nagentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3.\nHigh-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a\nHierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a\ndependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency.\nEvaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2%\nsuccess rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing\nframeworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the\nexpertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems\ncan democratize complex scientific computing.

Its adaptability makes\nit more suitable for analyzing real-world graphs where noise and imperfect data\nare common and the ideal clique model is often impractical. The problem of\nidentifying the maximum $ k $-plex (MKP, which is NP-hard) is gaining attention\nin fields such as social network analysis, community detection, terrorist\nnetwork identification, and graph clustering. Recent works have focused on\noptimizing the time complexity of MKP algorithms. The state-of-the-art has\nreduced the complexity from a trivial $ O^*(2^n) $ to $ O^*(c_k^n) $, with $\nc_k > 1.94 $ for $ k \\geq 3 $, where $ n $ denotes the vertex number. This\npaper investigates the MKP using two quantum models: gate-based model and\nannealing-based model. Two gate-based algorithms, qTKP and qMKP, are proposed\nto achieve $ O^*(1.42^n) $ time complexity. qTKP integrates quantum search with\ngraph encoding, degree counting, degree comparison, and size determination to\nfind a $ k $-plex of a given size; qMKP uses binary search to progressively\nidentify the maximum solution. Furthermore, by reformulating MKP as a quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization problem, we propose qaMKP, the first\nannealing-based approximation algorithm, which utilizes qubit resources more\nefficiently than gate-based algorithms. To validate the practical performance,\nproof-of-principle experiments were conducted using the latest IBM gate-based\nquantum simulator and D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer. This work holds\npotential to be applied to a wide range of clique relaxations, e.g., $ n $-clan\nand $ n $-club."}

The\nreliance on static peak memory estimates exacerbates fragmentation,\nunderutilization, and job rejections. We propose Scheduler-Driven Job\nAtomization (SJA), a new paradigm that establishes a bidirectional interaction\nbetween scheduler and jobs. In SJA, the scheduler advertises available\nexecution gaps, and jobs respond by signaling interest if they can potentially\ngenerate a subjob that fits the offered time-capacity window. The scheduler may\ncollect multiple signals for the same slot and, based on its allocation policy\n(e.g., fairness, efficiency, or SLA priorities), selects which job is granted\nthe slot. Only then does the chosen job materialize a safe, self-contained\nsubjob tailored to that opportunity. Unlike migration or preemption, SJA\nproactively shapes workloads before execution, thereby avoiding costly state\ntransfers and unpredictable interruptions. It aims to increase GPU utilization,\nreduce wait times, and minimize migration overhead by aligning jobs with\nopportunities in real time, ensuring that each admitted subjob is correct by\nconstruction.

This study presents the first\ncomprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art AI approaches for automated\nantepartum CTG analysis. We systematically compare time-series FMs and LLMs\nagainst established CTG-specific architectures. Our evaluation encompasses over\n500 CTG recordings of varying durations reflecting real-world clinical\nrecordings, providing robust performance benchmarks across different modelling\nparadigms. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior\nperformance compared to both foundation models and domain-specific approaches,\noffering a promising alternative pathway for clinical CTG interpretation. These\nfindings provide critical insights into the relative strengths of different AI\nmethodologies for fetal monitoring applications and establish a foundation for\nfuture clinical AI development in prenatal care."}

However, due to the high cost of RCTs, the\nproportion of trial data relative to observational data is small, which only\naccounts for 0.65\\% of total traffic in our context, resulting in significant\nbias when generalizing to the broader user base. Additionally, the complexity\nof industrial processes reduces the quality of RCT data, which is often subject\nto heterogeneity from potential interference and selection bias, making it\ndifficult to correct. Moreover, existing data fusion methods are challenging to\nimplement effectively in complex industrial settings due to the high\ndimensionality of features and the strict assumptions that are hard to verify\nwith real-world data. To address these issues, we propose an empirical data\nfusion method called pseudo-sample matching. By generating pseudo-samples from\nbiased, low-quality RCT data and matching them with the most similar samples\nfrom large-scale observational data, the method expands the RCT dataset while\nmitigating its heterogeneity. We validated the method through simulation\nexperiments, conducted offline and online tests using real-world data. In a\nweek-long online experiment, we achieved a 0.41\\% improvement in profit, which\nis a considerable gain when scaled to industrial scenarios with hundreds of\nmillions in revenue.

Across GSM8K and\nMATH-$500$ benchmarks, ALS achieves $2$--$5\\times$ speedup over iterative\nmethods while matching or surpassing greedy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and\nSelf-Consistency baselines, yielding up to 101\\% improvement in\nefficiency--accuracy trade-off. These results show that much of latent\noptimization's benefit can be captured offline, making sophisticated reasoning\ntechniques viable for production deployment.

Accurately forecasting this demand for applications like\nmicrogrid management and demand response therefore requires generative models\nthat can produce realistic daily activity sequences, capturing both the timing\nand duration of human behavior. This paper develops a generative model of human\nactivity sequences using nationally representative time-use diaries at a\n10-minute resolution. We use this model to quantify which demographic factors\nare most critical for improving predictive performance.\n  We propose a hierarchical semi-Markov framework that addresses two key\nmodeling challenges. First, a time-inhomogeneous Markov \\emph{router} learns\nthe patterns of ``which activity comes next.\" Second, a semi-Markov\n\\emph{hazard} component explicitly models activity durations, capturing ``how\nlong\" activities realistically last. To ensure statistical stability when data\nare sparse, the model pools information across related demographic groups and\ntime blocks. The entire framework is trained and evaluated using survey design\nweights to ensure our findings are representative of the U.S. population.\n  On a held-out test set, we demonstrate that explicitly modeling durations\nwith the hazard component provides a substantial and statistically significant\nimprovement over purely Markovian models.

For each problem, we provided one or two source\npapers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then\nassessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5\nproduced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different\napproximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while\nproviding a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required\ncombining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a\nvalidated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but\nfailed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected.\nAlthough our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on\nroutine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations\nwhen cross-paper synthesis is required.

Our results reveal systemic risks where even\nagents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply\nchain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher\nunder RCP8.5 compared to the baseline.

We design an attention-gated module to fuse these two\ncomplementary sources of information intelligently, and a multi-kernel dilated\nconvolutional network is then used to deepen the understanding of temporal\npatterns. Comprehensive experiments on multiple widely used real-world\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model."}

Additionally, the complexity\nof industrial processes reduces the quality of RCT data, which is often subject\nto heterogeneity from potential interference and selection bias, making it\ndifficult to correct. Moreover, existing data fusion methods are challenging to\nimplement effectively in complex industrial settings due to the high\ndimensionality of features and the strict assumptions that are hard to verify\nwith real-world data. To address these issues, we propose an empirical data\nfusion method called pseudo-sample matching. By generating pseudo-samples from\nbiased, low-quality RCT data and matching them with the most similar samples\nfrom large-scale observational data, the method expands the RCT dataset while\nmitigating its heterogeneity. We validated the method through simulation\nexperiments, conducted offline and online tests using real-world data. In a\nweek-long online experiment, we achieved a 0.41\\% improvement in profit, which\nis a considerable gain when scaled to industrial scenarios with hundreds of\nmillions in revenue. In addition, we discuss the harm to model training,\noffline evaluation, and online economic benefits when the RCT data quality is\nnot high, and emphasize the importance of improving RCT data quality in\nindustrial scenarios.

In this work, we introduce Reverse-Complement\nConsistency Regularization (RCCR), a simple and model-agnostic fine-tuning\nobjective that directly penalizes the divergence between a model's prediction\non a sequence and the aligned prediction on its reverse complement. We evaluate\nRCCR across three diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA,\nDNABERT-2) on a wide range of genomic tasks, including sequence classification,\nscalar regression, and profile prediction. Our experiments show that RCCR\nsubstantially improves RC robustness by dramatically reducing prediction flips\nand errors, all while maintaining or improving task accuracy compared to\nbaselines such as RC data augmentation and test-time averaging.

To circumvent\nthe prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs\nupcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its\nfeed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert\ndiversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This\npaper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using\nexperts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained\nmodels (e.g., Llama2-Chat and Code Llama). A key challenge lies in the fact\nthat these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter\nspace, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To\novercome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to\nharmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture.

We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel\nGNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that\naddresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates\nsimilarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence\nor divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying\nmechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and\nmaintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple\nrepresentation clusters.

To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed.

While joint processing can\neliminate the delay in target estimation found in sequential approaches, it\nintroduces complex variable coupling, posing challenges in both modeling and\noptimization. This paper presents a joint modeling approach that formulates\ncooperative and non-cooperative localization as a single optimization problem.\nTo address the resulting coupling, we introduce auxiliary variables that enable\nstructural decoupling and distributed computation. Building on this\nformulation, we develop the Scaled Proximal Alternating Direction Method of\nMultipliers for Joint Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization\n(SP-ADMM-JCNL). Leveraging the problem's structured design, we provide\ntheoretical guarantees that the algorithm generates a sequence converging\nglobally to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the reformulated problem and\nfurther to a critical point of the original non-convex objective function, with\na sublinear rate of O(1/T). Experiments on both synthetic and benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that SP-ADMM-JCNL achieves accurate and reliable\nlocalization performance."}

We address this zero-shot setting by\nproposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the\ninductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior\n(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key\nassumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,\nand that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or\nstochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based\ntraining framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for\nself-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in\nDIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,\npatch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual\nloss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel\nfidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,\nand remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels.

We propose a refinement of the Babai type conjecture on\ndiameters of Sn: n^2/2 + 4n upper bounds in the undirected case, compared to\nprevious O(n^2) bounds. We also provide explicit generator families, related to\ninvolutions in a square with whiskers pattern, conjectured to maximize the\ndiameter; search confirms this for all n up to 15. We further conjecture an\nanswer to a question posed by V M Glushkov in 1968 on directed Cayley graphs\ngenerated by a cyclic shift and a transposition.\n  For nilpotent groups we conjecture an improvement of J S Ellenberg's results\non upper unitriangular matrices over Z/pZ, showing linear dependence of\ndiameter on p. Moreover.\n  Some conjectures are LLM friendly, naturally stated as sorting problems\nverifiable by algorithms or Python code. To benchmark path finding we created\nmore than 10 Kaggle datasets. CayleyPy works with arbitrary permutation or\nmatrix groups and includes over 100 predefined generators. Our growth\ncomputation code outperforms GAP and Sage up to 1000 times in speed and size."}

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively.

We present a new dataset,\nresults, and a detailed analysis of the state-of-the-art in audio-based\npedestrian detection in the presence of vehicular noise. In our study, we\nconduct three analyses: (i) cross-dataset evaluation between noisy and\nnoise-limited environments, (ii) an assessment of the impact of noisy data on\nmodel performance, highlighting the influence of acoustic context, and (iii) an\nevaluation of the model's predictive robustness on out-of-domain sounds. The\nnew dataset is a comprehensive 1321-hour roadside dataset. It incorporates\ntraffic-rich soundscapes. Each recording includes 16kHz audio synchronized with\nframe-level pedestrian annotations and 1fps video thumbnails."}

However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human\ndemonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the\ndiminishing returns from increasing offline data. In comparison, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the\nenvironment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still,\ntraining RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to\nsample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from\nsparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom\n(DoF) systems. We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL\nthrough a residual learning framework. Our approach leverages BC policies as\nblack-box bases and learns lightweight per-step residual corrections via\nsample-efficient off-policy RL. We demonstrate that our method requires only\nsparse binary reward signals and can effectively improve manipulation policies\non high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in both simulation and the real world.\nIn particular, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nsuccessful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands. Our\nresults demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in various vision-based tasks,\npointing towards a practical pathway for deploying RL in the real world.\nProject website: https://residual-offpolicy-rl.github.io"}
