However, existing PP-ANNS solutions fall short of meeting\nthe requirements of data privacy, efficiency, accuracy, and minimal user\ninvolvement concurrently. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel\nsolution that primarily executes PP-ANNS on a single cloud server to avoid the\nheavy communication overhead between the cloud and the user. To ensure data\nprivacy, we introduce a novel encryption method named distance comparison\nencryption, facilitating secure, efficient, and exact distance comparisons. To\noptimize the trade-off between data privacy and search performance, we design a\nprivacy-preserving index that combines the state-of-the-art $k$-ANNS method\nwith an approximate distance computation method.

This work presents CarAT (Carbon Atom Tracker), an\nautomated methodology for calculating BCC across industrial value chains,\nenabling dynamic and accurate sustainability reporting. The approach leverages\nexisting Enterprise Resource Planning data in three stages: (1) preparing value\nchain data, (2) performing atom mapping in chemical reactions using chemistry\nlanguage models, and (3) applying a linear program to calculate BCC given known\ninlet compositions. The methodology is validated on a 27-node industrial\ntoluene diisocyanate value chain.

Existing\nretrieval-based solutions address some of these issues but often miss\nfine-grained visual details and struggle with niche or specialized categories.\n  We propose Optimized Preference-Based AI for Listings (OPAL), a framework for\ngenerating schema-compliant, high-quality item descriptions from images using a\nfine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM). OPAL addresses key\nchallenges in multimodal e-commerce applications, including bridging modality\ngaps and capturing detailed contextual information.

The prevalence of partially synchronized\npatterns, such as Disperse synchronization and Sparse synchronization, reveals\nstructural disconnects in current cross-platform release practices.

We study model-induced stochasticity, which\nquantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when\nthe set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.\n  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast\naccuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time\nseries forecasting.

Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages.

The samples were compared for the\nnumber of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding\nlocal minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has\nbeen achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,\nthe states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs\nthan in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two\ntechniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques\nwere (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many\npotentially \"important\" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if\nnot high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling\ntechniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at\nlater than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the\ntraining when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful\ndifferences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the\nfailure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement\nwhen using D-Wave-based sampling.

This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core\nproblem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that\nunderstanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,\nparticularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a\nnew framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural\nlanguage problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet\nexpressive domain.

To bridge this gap, we conducted\na user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in\nbiomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to\nvisualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who\nclassified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad\nsynthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the\nTransformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the\nattention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the\npredictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how\nattention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual\neffectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred\nmore intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our\nresults do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for\nexplanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how\nthey are visually presented."}

Typical data\naugmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and\nits label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's\ngeneralization capacity.

Here we challenge this view by\nestablishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally\ndifferent computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal\ndynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.\n  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing\nparadox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By\nencoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a\nbimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by\nphase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting\ndynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In\ncontrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the\nrepresentational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their\nartificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including\nclassification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.\n  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment\nbetween input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn,\noffers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in\nneuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration\ndynamic. It demonstrates that computation in both biological and artificial\nsystems can be dynamically sculpted by 'software' on fixed 'hardware', pointing\ntoward a potential paradigm shift for AI research: away from designing complex\nstatic architectures and toward mastering adaptive, dynamic computation\nprinciples."}

Based on this foundation, we propose\nMed-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather\nthan relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly\nacquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --\nenabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing\nlungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding\nbenchmarks.

In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in\nattractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we\ncomprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield\nnetwork undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to\nformation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show\nthat, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce\na pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new\nattractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an\nabrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful\nlearning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point\nattractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With\nthis, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same\nmechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal\nand applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of\nmemory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of\na wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to\nmitigate their flaws."}
