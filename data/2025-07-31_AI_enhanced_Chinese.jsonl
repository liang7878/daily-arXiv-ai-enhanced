To address the inefficiencies of\nstandard hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods in large scale\nsettings, we develop a macro element HDG method that reduces global and local\ndegrees of freedom by embedding continuous Galerkin structure within\nmacro-elements. This formulation supports matrix free implementations and\nenables highly parallel local solves, leading to substantial performance gains\nand excellent scalability on modern architectures. To enhance robustness in\nunder resolved or turbulent regimes, we extend the method using entropy\nvariables and a flux differencing approach to construct entropy stable and\nkinetic energy preserving variants. These formulations satisfy a discrete\nentropy inequality and improve stability without compromising high order\naccuracy. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on benchmark\nproblems including the inviscid isentropic vortex and the Taylor Green vortex\nin both inviscid and turbulent regimes. Numerical results confirm optimal\naccuracy, improved robustness, and up to an order of magnitude speedup over\nstandard HDG methods.

In cardiac\nelectro-mechanics, finite element method (FEM)-based simulations provide\nvaluable insights into diseased tissue behaviour and the development of\nassistive systems such as di-electric elastomer actuators.

A key factor contributing\nto the success of GR is the semantic ID (SID), which converts continuous\nsemantic representations (e.g., from large language models) into discrete ID\nsequences. This enables GR models with SIDs to both incorporate semantic\ninformation and learn collaborative filtering signals, while retaining the\nbenefits of discrete decoding. However, varied modeling techniques,\nhyper-parameters, and experimental setups in existing literature make direct\ncomparisons between GR proposals challenging. Furthermore, the absence of an\nopen-source, unified framework hinders systematic benchmarking and extension,\nslowing model iteration. To address this challenge, our work introduces and\nopen-sources a framework for Generative Recommendation with semantic ID, namely\nGRID, specifically designed for modularity to facilitate easy component\nswapping and accelerate idea iteration. Using GRID, we systematically\nexperiment with and ablate different components of GR models with SIDs on\npublic benchmarks.

This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the \"hard systematicity\nchallenge.\" However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be\nregulated by the rationales for systematization.

A commonly used model\nassumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with\na shared singular subspace. In this case, two primary methods have emerged for\nestimating this shared structure, which vary in how they integrate information\nacross datasets. The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the\ndatasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second\napproach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset,\nthen aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally\ncomputes a consensus amongst them. While these methods are widely used, they\nhave not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which\nis of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and\ndimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty\nabout which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their\npotential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the\nasymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop\noptimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods.

To assess the quality of knowledge graphs,\nexisting works either propose high-level frameworks comprising various data\nquality dimensions without concrete implementations, define tools that measure\ndata quality with ad-hoc SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)\nqueries, or promote the usage of constraint languages, such as the Shapes\nConstraint Language (SHACL), to assess and improve the quality of the graph.\nAlthough the latter approaches claim to address data quality assessment, none\nof them comprehensively tries to cover all data quality dimensions.

We introduce two novel hybrid\nactivation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4\n(smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for\npositive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a\nsteepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary\nclassification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three\ndifferent neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance\ncompared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on\nMNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.\nThe function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable\ngradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's\ngradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep\nnetworks.

Recent design approaches of dental crowns are\ncarried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a\npreparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually\ndefine a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a\nnon-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework\nto determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A\ndataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to\ntrain a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was\nmodified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth\ninto two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary\nfaces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to\ntrain 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their\nresults to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and\noptimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation\nresults. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to\nrepresent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the\ncenters of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that\nan ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest\nnumber of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance\nthreshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground\ntruth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the\npreparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth\nmargin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683).

Existing approaches primarily focus on modeling item-item\nassociations deduced from user behaviors using graph neural networks (GNNs) or\nleveraging item content information. However, these methods often overlook\ncritical challenges, such as noisy user behavior data and data sparsity due to\nthe long-tailed distribution of these behaviors. In this paper, we propose\nMMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning\nframework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three\nmain components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that\nleverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a\nself-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and\nlearns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation\naggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic\nand task levels. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to generate augmented training\ndata, further enhancing the denoising process during training. We conduct\nextensive experiments on five real-world datasets, showing that MMSC\noutperforms existing baselines by 26.1% for substitutable recommendation and\n39.2% for complementary recommendation.

However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of\nfuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed\nfuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,\nthe dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical\ncomponents, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely\ntied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the\nchallenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to\nremove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With\ntheir strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to\ngenerate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct\nbug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which\nintegrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and\nmutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call\nchain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To\nconstruct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,\nobtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which\nfurther help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate\nRandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,\nBeacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz.

The core idea is to construct a stochastic mapping from\nthe input to a high-dimensional latent representation, enabling\nuncertainty-aware prediction of the solution. Specifically, the architecture\nconsists of a confidence-aware encoder and a probabilistic decoder. The encoder\nimplements a high-dimensional latent variable model based on a Gaussian process\n(LVM-GP), where the latent representation is constructed by interpolating\nbetween a learnable deterministic feature and a Gaussian process prior, with\nthe interpolation strength adaptively controlled by a confidence function\nlearned from data. The decoder defines a conditional Gaussian distribution over\nthe solution field, where the mean is predicted by a neural operator applied to\nthe latent representation, allowing the model to learn flexible\nfunction-to-function mapping.

This development happens in parallel with a growing demand\nof data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient\noptimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously\nestablished as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In\nparallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an\nobjective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level.

Moreover, sampling quality and\nassessing design parameter sensitivity is often an underrepresented part of\ndata-driven design.

We show that, for both\nMMD-based and adversarial models, the sample complexity admits an upper bound\nthat scales quadratically with network depth and width. Furthermore, our\nanalysis suggests that in semi-supervised settings, robustness to limited\nlabeled target data can be achieved by scaling the target loss proportionally\nto the square root of the number of labeled target samples.

This paper studies the\nmean-variance optimization in a setting of finite-horizon discrete-time Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs), where the objective is to maximize the combined\nmetrics of mean and variance of the accumulated rewards at terminal stage. By\nintroducing the concepts of pseudo mean and pseudo variance, we convert the\noriginal mean-variance MDP to a bilevel MDP, where the outer is a single\nparameter optimization of the pseudo mean and the inner is a standard\nfinite-horizon MDP with an augmented state space by adding an auxiliary state\nof accumulated rewards. We further study the properties of this bilevel MDP,\nincluding the optimality of history-dependent deterministic policies and the\npiecewise quadratic concavity of the inner MDPs' optimal values with respect to\nthe pseudo mean. To efficiently solve this bilevel MDP, we propose an iterative\nalgorithm that alternatingly updates the inner optimal policy and the outer\npseudo mean.

Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse\ndatasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at\nleast as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding\ndata. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of\nqueries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x\nthroughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets.

This dual-factor model, governed by an adaptive\nweight, enables SAM to achieve sustained high performance through strategic\nstability and robustness in volatile conditions.\n  Extensive experiments against 14 diverse baselines demonstrate SAM's\nsuperiority. It achieves top-tier throughput while being uniquely resilient to\ncomplex workload shifts and cache pollution attacks. Furthermore, its decision\nlatency is highly scalable, remaining nearly constant as the system grows to\n120 databases.

However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant\non historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e.,\noptimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent.\nThis log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical\npreferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests.

By integrating large\nlanguage models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval,\nand explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into\nan intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the\nabove domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a\nmulti-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced\npre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative\njudge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App.\nOnline experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance\ngains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and\nsatisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions.\nThese comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that\nLLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually\nbeneficial recommendation ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRecGPT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7f6e\u4e8e\u63a8\u8350\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u6dd8\u5b9dApp\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4ee5\u610f\u56fe\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u5171\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u65e5\u5fd7\u62df\u5408\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u6f5c\u5728\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u751f\u6001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRecGPT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u6316\u6398\u3001\u7269\u54c1\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u7531\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u8bc4\u5224\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "RecGPT\u5728\u6dd8\u5b9dApp\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5546\u5bb6\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u591a\u66dd\u5149\u548c\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4ee5\u610f\u56fe\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u4e92\u5229\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In the\nprocess, I show multiple unexpected behaviors in Git, including the following:\nThe histogram diff algorithm has pathological cases where a single-line change\ncan cause the entire rest of the file to be marked as changed. The default\nmerge strategy (ort) can result in merges requiring exponential time in the\nnumber of commits in the history. Merges and rebases are not commutative, and\neven when merges do not result in a conflict, the result is not specified but\ndepends on the diff algorithm used.

In this paper, we revisit\nhypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization\ncapabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous\npersonalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which\nleverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding\nvectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's\nheterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we\nintroduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with\nsimilar model sizes to share heads.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose AUV-Fusion, a cross-modal adversarial attack framework\nthat adopts high-order user preference modeling and cross-modal adversary\ngeneration.

Owing to limited computational resources, operational\nmedium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models,\nwhich are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations,\nthe proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based\npost-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble\nmember, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution\nmodel outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of\nthe CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of\nCNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For\ncomparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with\nthe CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN\ncorrection before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy\nthan the reverse approach.

Given a task description,\nMetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an\noptimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite\nstate machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To\nevaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and\npractical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system\nsurpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance\nwith the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those\nspecific tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u7684MetaAgent\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7ed3\u6784\u50f5\u5316\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMetaAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6253\u78e8\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7528\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MetaAgent\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, harnessing\nthe power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires\nformulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to\nautomatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus\nbridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated\narchitecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about\nthe relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in\nmanufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we\nevaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate\ninformation retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,\nparticularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core\nInformation Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding\nrelevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in\ntransforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries.

This addresses a\nkey limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data\nscaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across\ncompute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments.

Recent methods enhance CFM performance by\ninducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on\ncomputationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights\nfrom entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow\nMatching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by\nweighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this\nweighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals,\nand we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly\nunchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the\nminibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes\ncomputational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size.

However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to\ncreate data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of\nthe original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The\nobjective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based\ncross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different\nclustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new\ncross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class\nstratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both\nbalanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing\ncross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost.\nThe technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification\noutperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though\nit did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets,\ntraditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing\nlower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for\nperformance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance.

Designed to learn and act independently,\nthese systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.\nHowever, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which\nare unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the\ndecision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous\nsystems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When\nmultiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must\nnegotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the\nparties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous\nsystems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into\ntheir decision-making through ethics-based negotiation.

To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real\nrobots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource\ncontention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness\nof the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation.

Existing techniques for APR are\noften combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the\ncode-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current\nLLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference\nstage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates\nit through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two\nimportant aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training\nphase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair.

Mixed-precision\nquantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between\nefficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization.

Recent studies utilizing\nbit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial\ntraining complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose\nMemory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that\naddresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable\ndifferentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model\nweights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,\nenabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter\nsplitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the\nsimultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.\nExperimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable\nparameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous\nbit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression\nrates.

Existing vulnerability\ndetection methods have their limitations: 1) Static analysis methods struggle\nwith complex scenarios. 2) Methods based on specialized pre-trained models\nperform well on specific datasets but have limited generalization capabilities.\nIn contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate\nimpressive ability in adapting to new vulnerability patterns. However, they\noften underperform on specific vulnerability types compared to methods based on\nspecialized pre-trained models. We also observe that explanations generated by\ngeneral-purpose LLMs can provide fine-grained code understanding information,\ncontributing to improved detection performance.\n  Inspired by these observations, we propose SAEL, an LLM-based framework for\nsmart contract vulnerability detection. We first design targeted prompts to\nguide LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities and generating explanations, which\nserve as prediction features. Next, we apply prompt-tuning on CodeT5 and T5 to\nprocess contract code and explanations, enhancing task-specific performance. To\ncombine the strengths of each approach, we introduce an Adaptive\nMixture-of-Experts architecture. This dynamically adjusts feature weights via a\nGating Network, which selects relevant features using TopK filtering and\nSoftmax normalization, and incorporates a Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism\nto enhance cross-feature relationships.

The design aims to add learner-defined structure to otherwise\nunstructured experiences and bring meaning to curation and reflection\nactivities by translating them into learning stories with AI-generated\nfeedback. We position storytelling as an integrative approach to design that\nconnects resource curation, reflective and sensemaking practice, and narrative\npractices learners already use across social platforms. We recruited 15\ninformal programming learners who are regular social media users to engage with\nthe system in a self-paced manner; participation concluded upon submitting a\nlearning story and survey. We used three quantitative scales and a qualitative\nsurvey to examine users' characteristics and perceptions of the system's\nsupport for their self-regulation. User feedback suggests the system's\nviability as a self-regulation aid. Learners particularly valued in-situ\nreflection, automated story feedback, and video annotation, while other\nfeatures received mixed views.

In particular, we focus on simulating scam\nconversations using LLMs. Our work incorporates two LLMs that converse with\neach other to simulate realistic, unsafe conversations that people may\nencounter online between a scammer LLM and a target LLM but users of our system\nare asked provide feedback to the target LLM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u8bc8\u9a97\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u8bdd\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u8bc8\u9a97\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u53cd\u9988\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u4e92\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6a21\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u3002"}}

Generative modeling based on density operator models\n(\\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such\nas those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,\nsuch as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a\nfundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable\nmodels on real-world datasets. \\textit{In this paper, we develop an\nExpectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined\nthrough \\textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those\nused for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,\ndesigning such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined\nquantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation\nstep. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum\ninformation projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map\nprovides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we\nintroduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an\niterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence\nlower bound. We show that the \\textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing\nlog-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models.

Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental\nflaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic\nfeatures. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained\ninformation due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,\nmemory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly\ncapture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise\npredictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical\nmemory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for\nmemory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic\ninformation. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel\nand semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism\nto perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their\ninherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local\nAlignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),\nwe achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level\nmemory and the semantic representations in high-level memory.

Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive\nCue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain\nDynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack\ncues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning\nStrategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain\nPerceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture\nspatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities.

To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,\nbitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and\nunderstudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,\nresulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery\nremains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames\nmay mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,\nwe propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that\nintegrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to\ndifferent types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the\nframework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich\npriors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and\ncorruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)\nmodule, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level\ncorruption understanding.

To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of\npredicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event\nlevel emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer\nand S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group\nmembers, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing\nmulti-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions\nprimarily based on emotion perception over time and group level.

One of the goals\nof safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing\nwith real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,\nwhere test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a\nquantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios\nmust be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is\nexpressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions\nabout the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while\navoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited\nparameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.\n  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF\nof the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple\nbase distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and\ndifferentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation\nwithout restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,\ncomparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional\nmethod for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational\nresources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.\nAs a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more\nprecise assessment of an ADS's safety.\n  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety.

OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,\nleading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised\nsetting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot\nsetting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching\nchallenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by\nthe classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we\nshow that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD\ndetection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD\ncombines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a\nspecific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier\ntrained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is\nmodular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus\nintroduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.\nWe evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also\nconsider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label\nnoise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been\npreviously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based\nOOD detection methods.

Work in progress", "summary": "Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have\nprogressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the\ninherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic\ncontent and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable\nperformance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these\nlimitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model\ntrained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning\n(PCuRL) framework.
