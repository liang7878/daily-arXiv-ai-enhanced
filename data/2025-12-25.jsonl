I introduce Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI), a paradigm that reconceptualizes intelligence as emergent from the coordination of multiple \"brains\", rather than a single one. At its core, the Differentiable Price Mechanism (DPM) computes the exact loss gradient $$ \\mathbf{G}_i = - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}_i} $$ as a dynamic, VCG-equivalent incentive signal, guaranteeing Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (DSIC) and convergence to the global optimum. A Bayesian extension ensures incentive compatibility under asymmetric information (BIC). The framework scales linearly ($\\mathcal{O}(N)$) with the number of agents, bypassing the combinatorial complexity of Dec-POMDPs and is empirically 50x faster than Model-Free Reinforcement Learning. By structurally aligning agent self-interest with collective objectives, it provides a provably efficient, auditable and generalizable approach to coordinated, trustworthy and scalable multi-agent intelligence grounded in economic principles."}

To avoid heavy on-chain workloads, systems like Truebit and optimistic rollups use challenge-based protocols, performing computations off-chain and invoking the chain only when challenged. This keeps normal-case costs low and, if at least one honest challenger exists, can catch fraud. What has been less clear is whether honest challengers are actually incentivized and a dishonest proposer is properly damaged under the worst case environment. We build a model with a colluding minority, heterogeneous costs, and three ordering modes. We then ask whether two goals can be met together: honest non-loss and fraud deterrence. Our results are clear: in single-winner designs, the incentive design is impossible or limited in scale. By contrast, in multi-winner designs, we obtain simple, explicit conditions under which both goals hold."}

However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \\textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \\textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests. We demonstrate that this approach effectively solves several standard coordination matrix games and a cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment."}

Despite its clinical importance, CMD remains underdiagnosed due to the reliance on invasive procedures such as pressure wire-based measurements of the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), which are costly, time-consuming, and carry procedural risks. To date, no study has sought to quantify CMD indices using data-driven approaches while leveraging the rich information contained in coronary angiograms. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel data-driven framework for inference of CMD indices based on coronary angiography. A physiologically validated multi-physics model was used to generate synthetic datasets for data-driven model training, consisting of CMD indices and computational angiograms with corresponding contrast intensity profiles (CIPs). Two neural network architectures were developed: a single-input-channel encoder-MLP model for IMR prediction and a dual-input-channel encoder-MLP model for CFR prediction, both incorporating epistemic uncertainty estimation to quantify prediction confidence. Results demonstrate that the data-driven models achieve high predictive accuracy when evaluated against physics-based synthetic datasets, and that the uncertainty estimates are positively correlated with prediction errors. Furthermore, the utility of CIPs as informative surrogates for coronary physiology is demonstrated, underscoring the potential of the proposed framework to enable accurate, real-time, image-based CMD assessment using routine angiography without the need for more invasive approaches."}

The model dynamically updates beliefs as additional expert calls occur and attenuates contradictory assessments, which are absent from existing text-based screening tools. Empirically, our model outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by 6.691% in F1-score and increases portfolio-level Return on Investment by 15.255%. Attention and ablation analyses reveal that conversational cues are particularly informative for technologically complex startups, young firms, diverse founding teams, and firms with low public visibility.

These workflows impose heterogeneous and often conflicting requirements on runtime systems, spanning MPI executables, persistent AI services, fine-grained tasks, and low-latency AI-HPC coupling. Existing systems typically address only subsets of these requirements, limiting their ability to support emerging AI-HPC applications at scale. We present RHAPSODY, a multi-runtime middleware that enables concurrent execution of heterogeneous AI-HPC workloads through uniform abstractions for tasks, services, resources, and execution policies. Rather than replacing existing runtimes, RHAPSODY composes and coordinates them, allowing simulation codes, inference services, and agentic workflows to coexist within a single job allocation on leadership-class HPC platforms. We evaluate RHAPSODY with Dragon and vLLM on multiple HPC systems using representative heterogeneous, inference-at-scale, and tightly coupled AI-HPC workflows. Our results show that RHAPSODY introduces minimal runtime overhead, sustains increasing heterogeneity at scale, achieves near-linear scaling for high-throughput inference workloads, and data- and control-efficient coupling between AI and HPC tasks in agentic workflows."}

While Zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods sidestep the need for labeled training data by leveraging pretrained vision-language models, they often rely on a single fused query that merges all descriptive cues of what the user wants, tending to dilute key information and failing to account for what they wish to avoid. Moreover, current CIR benchmarks assume a single correct target per query, overlooking the ambiguity in modification texts. To address these challenges, we propose Soft Filtering with Textual constraints (SoFT), a training-free, plug-and-play filtering module for ZS-CIR. SoFT leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to extract two complementary constraints from the reference-modification pair: prescriptive (must-have) and proscriptive (must-avoid) constraints. These serve as semantic filters that reward or penalize candidate images to re-rank results, without modifying the base retrieval model or adding supervision. In addition, we construct a two-stage dataset pipeline that refines CIR benchmarks. We first identify multiple plausible targets per query to construct multi-target triplets, capturing the open-ended nature of user intent. Then guide multimodal LLMs to rewrite the modification text to focus on one target, while referencing contrastive distractors to ensure precision. This enables more comprehensive and reliable evaluation under varying ambiguity levels. Applied on top of CIReVL, a ZS-CIR retriever, SoFT raises R@5 to 65.25 on CIRR (+12.94), mAP@50 to 27.93 on CIRCO (+6.13), and R@50 to 58.44 on FashionIQ (+4.59), demonstrating broad effectiveness."}

Our approach deploys a 1-bit quantized Llama-3.2-1B model on Raspberry Pi hardware, achieving 71.4 times energy reduction compared to full-precision models while maintaining intelligent control capabilities.

These decarbonized indices optimize the portfolio weights by minimizing the mean-VaR and mean-ES and seek to reduce the risk of significant financial losses while still pursuing decarbonization goals.

Words with symbol frequencies far from one half have smaller combinatorial richness and therefore appear less complex under the standard definition.

This adjustment isolates intrinsic descriptive complexity from the purely combinatorial effect of symbol imbalance. For Martin Löf random sequences under constructive exchangeable measures, the adjusted complexity grows linearly and converges to one. A pathological construction shows that regularity of the underlying measure is essential.

Although the literature includes linear and near-linear time algorithms for the LAD line fitting problem, these methods are difficult to implement and, to our knowledge, lack maintained public implementations. As a result, practitioners often resort to linear programming (LP) based methods such as the simplex-based Barrodale-Roberts method and interior-point methods, or on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approximation which does not guarantee exact solutions. To close this gap, we propose the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact algorithm for LAD line fitting. PALB uses supporting lines derived from subgradients to build piecewise-affine lower bounds, and employs a subdivision scheme involving minima of these lower bounds. We prove correctness and provide bounds on the number of iterations. On synthetic datasets with varied signal types and noise including heavy-tailed outliers as well as a real dataset from the NOAA's Integrated Surface Database, PALB exhibits empirical log-linear scaling. It is consistently faster than publicly available implementations of LP based and IRLS based solvers. We provide a reference implementation written in Rust with a Python API."}

However, we found that such power-law-based correction overly penalizes popular items and harms their recommendation performance. We address this issue by redefining the propensity score to allow broader item recommendation without excessively penalizing popular items. The proposed score is formulated by applying a sigmoid function to the logarithm of the item observation frequency, maintaining the simplicity of power-law scoring while allowing for more flexible adjustment. Furthermore, we incorporate the redefined propensity score into a linear autoencoder model, which tends to favor popular items, and evaluate its effectiveness. Experimental results revealed that our method substantially improves the diversity of items in the recommendation list without sacrificing recommendation accuracy."}

These tasks present stochastic payoffs and stochastic prices, respectively. The analysis uses statistical hypothesis testing to compare gender-specific responses across three experimental designs.\n  Findings: The key results of the study indicate that women typically exhibit higher degrees of PaRA than men, which is a consistent finding with the mainstream literature. However, remarkably, the results from all the three indirect MCL designs show that women typically exhibit lower degrees of PrRA than men, and this result is robust across different MCL designs.

Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization."}

Code available at https://github.com/wltang-dev/Latent-Strategy-RL-Agent", "summary": "This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.\n  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation."}

In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems."}

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline."}

Our approach discretizes time into k buckets, coalescing deposits within the same bucket to limit unique expiration timestamps. We prove three key properties: (1) storage is bounded by k+1 records regardless of deposit frequency, (2) actual expiration time is always at least the configured TTL, and (3) adversaries cannot increase a victim's operation cost beyond O(k)[amortized] worst case.

However, the effective application of MLLMs to multimodal sequential recommendation remains unexplored: A) Existing methods primarily leverage the multimodal semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained MLLMs to generate item embeddings or semantic IDs, thereby enhancing traditional recommendation models. These approaches generate item representations that exhibit limited interpretability, and pose challenges when transferring to language model-based recommendation systems. B) Other approaches convert user behavior sequence into image-text pairs and perform recommendation through multiple MLLM inference, incurring prohibitive computational and time costs. C) Current MLLM-based recommendation systems generally neglect the integration of collaborative signals. To address these limitations while balancing recommendation performance, interpretability, and computational cost, this paper proposes MultiModal Summarization-and-Retrieval-Augmented Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, we first employ MLLM to summarize items into concise keywords and fine-tune the model using rewards that incorporate summary length, information loss, and reconstruction difficulty, thereby enabling adaptive adjustment of the summarization policy. Inspired by retrieval-augmented generation, we then transform collaborative signals into corresponding keywords and integrate them as supplementary context. Finally, we apply supervised fine-tuning with multi-task learning to align the MLLM with the multimodal sequential recommendation. Extensive evaluations on common recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MMSRARec, showcasing its capability to efficiently and interpretably understand user behavior histories and item information for accurate recommendations."}

Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora."}

Do LLMs Bend the Rules in Programming?", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints."}

While GPU spot instances offer a low-cost alternative to on-demand resources, their volatile prices and availability make deadline-aware scheduling particularly challenging. We tackle this difficulty by using a mix of spot and on-demand instances. Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \\emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$.

One main obstacle in using standard decomposition techniques for planar graphs, like Baker's technique and extensions thereof, is that connectivity requirements are global (rather than local) properties that are not captured by existing frameworks.\n  We present a novel, and arguably clean, decomposition technique for such classical connectivity problems on planar graphs. This technique immediately implies PTASs for the problems of finding a smallest k-edge-connected or k-vertex-connected spanning subgraph of a planar graph for arbitrary k.

Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels."}

Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings. By reframing LLMs as knowledge curation engines rather than black-box predictors, this work demonstrates a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-compatible pathway for advancing AI-driven decision support in oncology."}

This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings."}

The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.\n  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs.

Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.\n  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.\n  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment.

This issue degrades generation quality, especially in the early stages. Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process. This preprocessing step simplifies the model's task of learning the target distribution, thereby improving generation quality even in the early stages of reconstruction with small networks. The proposed method is, in principle, applicable to a broad range of generative tasks, enabling more stable and efficient sampling processes."}

However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments."}

We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors.

Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation. FEM-Bench establishes a structured foundation for evaluating AI-generated scientific code, and future iterations will incorporate increasingly sophisticated tasks to track progress as models evolve."}

On 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models, Gate-Norm prunes the model in under a second. Pruning $8$--$16$ attention sublayers yields up to $1.30\\times$ higher inference throughput while keeping average zero-shot accuracy within $2\\%$ of the unpruned baseline across BoolQ, RTE, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy/Challenge, and OpenBookQA.

Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice."}

Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora."}

To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques.

Through robust modelling in the Julia programming language, our method uses the Scientific ML frameworks: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and Universal differential equations (UDEs) to predict and forecast the system dynamics. In addition, an essential component of our analysis involves determining the forecasting breakdown point, which is the smallest possible amount of training data our models need to predict future, unseen data accurately.

Though such problems are often solved through finite-dimensional gradient descent over a parametrization of the functions, such as neural networks, an interesting alternative is to instead perform gradient descent directly in the function space by leveraging its Hilbert space structure, thus enabling provable guarantees and fast convergence. However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation. We showcase the use of our method to solve partial differential equations à la physics informed neural networks (PINNs), where it effectively enables provable convergence."}

As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches."}

We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.\n  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA.

To mitigate this, we propose \\textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions."}

Alongside precision/recall, we propose an efficiency metric measuring expected time per qualified candidate.

A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets."}

To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks.

To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads.

To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $π^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{π^{*-1}(i),k} \\geq M_{π^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\\in [n-1], k \\in [d]$. Then, ranking experts amounts to constructing an estimator of $π^*$. In particular, we investigate here the existence of statistically optimal and computationally efficient procedures and we describe recent results that disprove the existence of computational-statistical gaps for this problem. To provide insights on the key ideas, we start by discussing simpler and yet related sub-problems, namely sub-matrix detection and estimation.

We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios. We discuss implications for reliability, relate our findings to prior work on instruction-following and long-context processing, and recommend strategies (such as self-refinement and dynamic prompting) to reduce laziness and bolster multi-instruction compliance."}

This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated."}

This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning."}

This sequential and adaptive nature enables the program to be modeled as a business process, thereby facilitating its analysis. Nevertheless, studies in this context face significant limitations inherent to real-world medical databases: data are often scarce due to both economic costs and the time required for collection; many existing records are not suitable for specific analytical purposes; and, finally, there is a high prevalence of missing values, as not all patients undergo the same diagnostic tests. To address these limitations, this work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for the synthesis of realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations. The primary objective is to increase the size and diversity of the available datasets in order to enhance the performance of cardiac risk prediction models and to reduce the need for potentially hazardous diagnostic procedures, such as exercise stress testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating coherent and realistic synthetic data, whose use improves the accuracy of the various classifiers employed for cardiac risk detection, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for synthetic data generation."}

However, in practice, it is common to perform \"low-level\" tasks before \"high-level\" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results."}

To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings.

PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\\times$ higher throughput per unit memory."}

Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant \"deliberative misalignment\", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world."}

Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation.

We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies.

This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance.

Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence."}

This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift."}

We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split. This methodology establishes a moving temporal frontier that prevents historical contamination and provides an authentic assessment of model generalization.

We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.\n  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA.

This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems."}

The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience.

The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology.

This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms."}

Despite recent progress of machine learning in different domains, these models have shown vulnerabilities when they are exposed to adversarial threats. Adversarial threats aim to hinder the machine learning models from satisfying their objectives. They can create adversarial perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans' eyes but have the ability to cause misclassification during inference. Moreover, they can poison the training data to harm the model's performance or they can query the model to steal its sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a defense system, which devises an adversarial training module within mixture-of-experts architecture to enhance its robustness against adversarial threats. In our proposed defense system, we use nine pre-trained experts with ResNet-18 as their backbone. During end-to-end training, the parameters of expert models and gating mechanism are jointly updated allowing further optimization of the experts. Our proposed defense system outperforms state-of-the-art defense systems and plain classifiers, which use a more complex architecture than our model's backbone."}

We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\\% [95\\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\\% [95\\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\\% [95\\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts."}

While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST.

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance."}

Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level."}

Thanks to sampling-based motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the state-of-the-art inspection planner."}

Understanding trust and prosociality in these settings is fundamental to improve human-AI teamwork. Research in biology and social sciences has identified mechanisms to sustain cooperation among humans. Indirect reciprocity (IR) is one of them. With IR, helping someone can enhance an individual's reputation, nudging others to reciprocate in the future. Transposing IR to human-AI interactions is however challenging, as differences in human demographics, moral judgements, and agents' learning dynamics can affect how interactions are assessed. To study IR in human-AI groups, we combine laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling. We investigate whether 1) indirect reciprocity can be transposed to children-robot interactions; 2) artificial agents can learn to cooperate given children's strategies; and 3) how differences in learning algorithms impact human-AI cooperation. We find that IR extends to children and robots solving coordination dilemmas. Furthermore, we observe that the strategies revealed by children provide a sufficient signal for multi-armed bandit algorithms to learn cooperative actions. Beyond the experimental scenarios, we observe that cooperating through multi-armed bandit algorithms is highly dependent on the strategies revealed by humans."}

We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures. In parallel, we introduce a denoising-consistency branch at random timesteps to stabilize the representations and preserve generative consistency.

Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm.

Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards.

Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines.

Our proposed approach uses Gaussian process operator learning to construct a flexible functional representation formulated directly on function space, making it independent of a particular equation or discretization. Our method is flexible, and can apply to a broad range of functional differential equations while still allowing for the incorporation of physical priors in either the prior mean or the kernel design. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several relevant equations, such as the Wetterich and Wilson--Polchinski equations, showing that it achieves equal or better performance than existing approximations such as the local-potential approximation, while being significantly more flexible. In particular, our method can handle non-constant fields, making it promising for the study of more complex field configurations, such as instantons."}

In this work, we introduce \\textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces. For each such fragment, the pipeline employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations. This results in the generation of \\textit{de novo} drug candidates with competitive binding affinities and high synthetic accessibility, while ensuring 100\\% chemical validity and novelty as per MOSES benchmarking.

These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak (\"model gaps\") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves (\"benchmark gaps\"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance.

Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps.

To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation."}

A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP.

A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity.

To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts.

In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems."}

Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency.

We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access.

The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations.

Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling.

We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces.

Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models. To address this challenging task, we develop PINNBARDS, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-Based AR Distribution Simulator, that uses observational toroids and MHD-SWT equations to derive initial state-vector. Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields (~2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields (~100 kG). We obtain best agreement with observations for 20-30 kG toroidal fields, and ~10 degree bandwidth, consistent with low-order longitudinal mode excitation.

Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk.

Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries.

On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "comment": null, "summary": "The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform \"low-level\" tasks before \"high-level\" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results."}

This crisis is driven by information leakage due to overlapping training and test sets across different models, as well as the illegitimate transfer of global patterns to test data. While the ability to learn shared temporal dynamics represents a primary strength of these models, their evaluation on historical archives often permits the exploitation of observed global shocks, which violates the independence required for valid benchmarking. We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split. This methodology establishes a moving temporal frontier that prevents historical contamination and provides an authentic assessment of model generalization. Initially applied within the energy sector, TS-Arena provides a sustainable infrastructure for comparing foundation models under real-world constraints. A prototype of the platform is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/DAG-UPB/TS-Arena."}

Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments."}

In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference. Simulation results show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms."}

Consequently, there has been significant effort to track its occurrence during VR use with brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG). However, a significant confound in current methods for detecting sickness from EEG is they do not account for the simultaneous processing of the sickening visual stimulus that is present in the brain data from VR. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) from an auditory stimulus shown to reflect cybersickness impacts, we can more precisely target EEG cybersickness features and use those to achieve better performance in online cybersickness classification. In this article, we introduce a method utilizing trained convolutional neural networks and transformer models and plot interpretability maps from integrated gradients and class activation to give a visual representation of what the model determined was most useful in sickness classification from an EEG dataset consisting of ERPs recorded during the elicitation of cybersickness. Across 12 runs of our method with three different neural networks, the models consistently pointed to a surprising finding: that amplitudes recorded at an electrode placed on the scalp near the left prefrontal cortex were important in the classification of cybersickness. These results help clarify a hidden pattern in other related research and point to exciting opportunities for future investigation: that this scalp location could be used as a tagged feature for better real-time cybersickness classification with EEG.

To handle missing text, we introduce nullable prompts, implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent and the use of text when present.

These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak (\"model gaps\") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves (\"benchmark gaps\"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

The system integrates domain-specific tools and specialized databases under a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising planning, coordination, and action layers. This architecture offers high flexibility and adaptability to previously unseen tasks, while providing a modular and extensible framework that can be readily expanded to incorporate new tools, data sources, or analytical capabilities. To further enhance performance, we introduce two novel algorithms: (1) LLM-driven prompt refinement with human feedback, and (2) schema-adaptive hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accurate information retrieval from large-scale structured grid datasets. Experimental evaluations across a variety of user queries and power grid cases demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of X-GridAgent in automating interpretable and rigorous power system analysis."}

Research on this problem began with the seminal work of Shah and Zaman in 2010, who formally defined it and introduced the notion of rumor centrality. With the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), several studies have proposed GNN-based approaches to source detection. However, some of these works lack methodological clarity and/or are hard to reproduce. As a result, it remains unclear (to us, at least) whether GNNs truly outperform more traditional source detection methods across comparable settings. In this paper, we first review existing GNN-based methods for source detection, clearly outlining the specific settings each addresses and the models they employ. Building on this research, we propose a principled GNN architecture tailored to the source detection task. We also systematically investigate key questions surrounding this problem. Most importantly, we aim to provide a definitive assessment of how GNNs perform relative to other source detection methods. Our experiments show that GNNs substantially outperform all other methods we test across a variety of network types. Although we initially set out to challenge the notion of GNNs as a solution to source detection, our results instead demonstrate their remarkable effectiveness for this task. We discuss possible reasons for this strong performance. To ensure full reproducibility, we release all code and data on GitHub. Finally, we argue that epidemic source detection should serve as a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures."}

MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over the base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety."}

Although the literature includes linear and near-linear time algorithms for the LAD line fitting problem, these methods are difficult to implement and, to our knowledge, lack maintained public implementations. As a result, practitioners often resort to linear programming (LP) based methods such as the simplex-based Barrodale-Roberts method and interior-point methods, or on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approximation which does not guarantee exact solutions. To close this gap, we propose the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact algorithm for LAD line fitting. PALB uses supporting lines derived from subgradients to build piecewise-affine lower bounds, and employs a subdivision scheme involving minima of these lower bounds. We prove correctness and provide bounds on the number of iterations. On synthetic datasets with varied signal types and noise including heavy-tailed outliers as well as a real dataset from the NOAA's Integrated Surface Database, PALB exhibits empirical log-linear scaling. It is consistently faster than publicly available implementations of LP based and IRLS based solvers. We provide a reference implementation written in Rust with a Python API."}

Built from hundreds of actual hardware designs produced by the Tiny Tapeout community, our automated pipeline removes duplicates, verifies correctness and periodically incorporates new designs to mitigate contamination, matching Tiny Tapeout release schedule.

We present the first physical attack on RF image based drone detectors, optimizing class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms that are transmitted alongside legitimate communications.

First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model.

Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution.

To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration.

Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models. To address this challenging task, we develop PINNBARDS, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-Based AR Distribution Simulator, that uses observational toroids and MHD-SWT equations to derive initial state-vector. Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields (~2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields (~100 kG). We obtain best agreement with observations for 20-30 kG toroidal fields, and ~10 degree bandwidth, consistent with low-order longitudinal mode excitation. To our knowledge, PINNBARDS serves as the first method for reconstructing state-vectors for hidden tachocline magnetic structures from surface patterns; potentially leading to weeks ahead prediction of flare-producing AR-emergence."}

Specifically, we first fix the U-Net bottleneck layer as the Clustering-friendly Middle Layer (CML), and then use Optimal Timestep Search (OTS) to identify the clustering-optimal timestep (t*). During training, we extract bottleneck features at the fixed t* and obtain clustering representations via a lightweight residual mapping. We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures. In parallel, we introduce a denoising-consistency branch at random timesteps to stabilize the representations and preserve generative consistency.

This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU."}

Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust."}

The weighted MCC varies between $-1$ and $1$. But crucially, the weighted MCC values are higher for classifiers that perform better on highly weighted observations, and hence is able to distinguish them from classifiers that have a similar overall performance and ones that perform better on the lowly weighted observations.\n  Furthermore, we prove that the weighted measures are robust with respect to the choice of weights in a precise manner:\n  if the weights are changed by at most $ε$, the value of the weighted measure changes at most by a factor of $ε$ in the binary case\n  and by a factor of $ε^2$ in the multiclass case.\n  Our computations demonstrate that the weighted measures clearly identify classifiers that perform better on higher weighted observations, while the unweighted measures remain completely indifferent to the choices of weights."}

Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks. We release our code at https://transductive-visualprogram.github.io/."}

Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($λ$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines."}

However, open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines linking dataset size to model performance remain limited. This study investigates the relationship between training data size and prediction accuracy for a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction. We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space. The results also suggest improved data utilization efficiency for larger surrogate models, implying a potential trade-off between dataset generation cost and model training budget."}

However, models used to quantify cellular morphology are typically trained with a single microscopy imaging type. This results in specialized models that cannot be reused across biological studies because the technical specifications do not match (e.g., different number of channels), or because the target experimental conditions are out of distribution. Here, we present CHAMMI-75, an open access dataset of heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies. We curated this resource from publicly available sources to investigate cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can process any microscopy image type. Our experiments show that training with CHAMMI-75 can improve performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks primarily because of its high diversity in microscopy modalities.

Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions."}

Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary \"thinking tokens\" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining."}

Their utility in traditional program analysis has been well established, enabling effective classification and analysis of malicious software. In the mobile domain, especially in the Android ecosystem, FCG-based malware classification is particularly critical due to the platform's widespread adoption and the complex, component-based structure of Android apps. However, progress in this direction is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality Android-specific FCG datasets. Existing datasets are often outdated, dominated by small or redundant graphs resulting from app repackaging, and fail to reflect the diversity of real-world malware. These limitations lead to overfitting and unreliable evaluation of graph-based classification methods. To address this gap, we introduce Better Call Graphs (BCG), a comprehensive dataset of large and unique FCGs extracted from recent Android application packages (APKs). BCG includes both benign and malicious samples spanning various families and types, along with graph-level features for each APK. Through extensive experiments using baseline classifiers, we demonstrate the necessity and value of BCG compared to existing datasets.

We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation.

These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization."}

In this work, we introduce \\textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces. For each such fragment, the pipeline employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations. This results in the generation of \\textit{de novo} drug candidates with competitive binding affinities and high synthetic accessibility, while ensuring 100\\% chemical validity and novelty as per MOSES benchmarking. This architecture highlights the potential of integrating structural biology, deep representation learning, and chemical synthesis rules to automate and accelerate rational drug design.

We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance.

As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches."}

Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.\n  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs.

Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \\emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$.

Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation."}

However, one of the bottlenecks of these models is slow sampling due to the delay before the onset of trajectory bifurcation, at which point substantial reconstruction begins. This issue degrades generation quality, especially in the early stages. Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process. This preprocessing step simplifies the model's task of learning the target distribution, thereby improving generation quality even in the early stages of reconstruction with small networks. The proposed method is, in principle, applicable to a broad range of generative tasks, enabling more stable and efficient sampling processes."}

We experimented with fine-tuning on purchase-driven query-title pairs, using role-specific prefixes to model query-item asymmetry. To meet production constraints, we apply Matryoshka Representation Learning to obtain compact, truncation-robust embeddings. Offline evaluation on historical search logs shows consistent gains over a strong generic encoder, with particularly large improvements when replacing PCA compression with Matryoshka truncation. A manual assessment further highlights better handling of proper nouns, marketplace-specific semantics, and term-importance alignment. Additionally, an initial online A/B test demonstrates statistically significant improvements in revenue per user and search-flow efficiency, with transaction frequency maintained.

However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \\textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \\textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests. We demonstrate that this approach effectively solves several standard coordination matrix games and a cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment."}

In the highly-degenerate regime, we find that a central role is played by the ramification locus of the projection.

A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets."}

We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI.

We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost.

With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings."}

In the first phase, HiGeMine employs a zero-shot semantic alignment strategy to filter reviews, retaining only those semantically consistent with the corresponding blurb, thereby mitigating noise, bias, and irrelevance. In the second phase, we introduce a dual-path, two-level graph-based classification architecture: a coarse-grained Level-1 binary classifier distinguishes fiction from non-fiction, followed by Level-2 multi-label classifiers for fine-grained genre prediction. Inter-genre dependencies are explicitly modeled using a label co-occurrence graph, while contextual representations are derived from pretrained language models applied to the filtered textual content. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we curate a new hierarchical book genre dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiGeMine consistently outperformed strong baselines across hierarchical genre classification tasks. The proposed framework offers a principled and effective solution for leveraging both structured and unstructured textual data in hierarchical book genre analysis."}

We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta).

Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10."}

However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation."}

To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\\times$ more data-efficient than standard training.

Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy."}

PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials.

To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques.

We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator."}

Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions."}

However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems."}

SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response.

Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk. Guided by the flatness-aware bound derived, (iii) we operationalize this objective via SAMerging, a method that employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to find flat minima. Empirically, SAMerging establishes a new state of the art across vision and NLP benchmarks, achieving remarkable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/arshandalili/SAMerging."}

In a preregistered experiment, over 500 consultants, data analysts, and managers completed professional tasks using one of 13 LLMs. We find that each year of AI model progress reduced task time by 8%, with 56% of gains driven by increased compute and 44% by algorithmic progress. However, productivity gains were significantly larger for non-agentic analytical tasks compared to agentic workflows requiring tool use. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by approximately 20% over the next decade."}

Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments."}
