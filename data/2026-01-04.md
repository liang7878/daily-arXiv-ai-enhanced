### [1] [The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850)
*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DDFT协议测量语言模型认知鲁棒性，发现认知鲁棒性与传统设计范式无关，错误检测能力是关键瓶颈，DDFT提供评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型评估无法衡量模型在现实压力下知识的鲁棒性，静态基准无法区分缺乏知识和验证机制崩溃的模型。

Method: 引入DDFT协议，提出双系统认知模型，对9个前沿模型在8个知识领域的5个压缩级别进行评估。

Result: 认知鲁棒性与参数数量和架构类型无关，错误检测能力强烈预测整体鲁棒性，旗舰模型仍有脆弱性，小模型可实现稳健性能。

Conclusion: DDFT框架为关键应用部署前评估认知鲁棒性提供理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

### [2] [CASCADE: Cumulative Agentic Skill Creation through Autonomous Development and Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23880)
*Xu Huang,Junwu Chen,Yuxing Fei,Zhuohan Li,Philippe Schwaller,Gerbrand Ceder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 针对大语言模型依赖预设工具等问题，提出CASCADE框架，在多任务中获高成功率并展示应用，推动AI辅助科研。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型依赖预设工具或脆弱的工具生成，限制了其对复杂科学任务的能力和适应性。

Method: 引入CASCADE框架，通过网络搜索和代码提取进行持续学习、通过内省和知识图探索进行自我反思等元技能，让代理掌握复杂外部工具和编码知识。

Result: 在SciSkillBench基准测试中，使用GPT - 5的CASCADE成功率达93.3%，相比无进化机制的35.4%有显著提升；可用于实际应用。

Conclusion: CASCADE能积累可跨代理和科学家共享的可执行技能，推动可扩展的AI辅助科学研究。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.

*Ioanna Gemou,Evangelos Lamprou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了结合大语言模型与答案集编程的框架McCoy用于疾病诊断，初步结果显示其在小规模疾病诊断任务上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的疾病预测很重要，但符号AI因构建高质量知识库的工作量大，在医疗领域应用受限，需解决此障碍。

Method: 引入McCoy框架，用大语言模型将医学文献转化为答案集编程代码，结合患者数据，用答案集编程求解器处理得出最终诊断。

Result: McCoy在小规模疾病诊断任务上表现良好。

Conclusion: McCoy是一个结合两种范式优势的、强大且可解释的预测框架。

Abstract: Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

### [4] [SPARK: Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24008)
*Gaurab Chhetri,Subasish Das,Tausif Islam Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SPARK框架，用基于角色的大语言模型代理实现个性化搜索，结合多理论建模，为下一代搜索系统提供见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化搜索需建模用户不断变化的多维信息需求，现有系统受静态配置文件或单一检索管道限制。

Method: 定义基于角色、专业知识、任务上下文和领域的角色空间，引入角色协调器激活相关代理，各代理执行独立检索增强生成过程，通过结构化通信协议协作。

Result: 框架产生关于协调效率、个性化质量和认知负载分布的可测试预测，包含自适应学习机制。

Conclusion: SPARK将细粒度代理专业化与协作检索相结合，为下一代搜索系统提供见解。

Abstract: Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

*Natchaya Temyingyong,Daman Jain,Neeraj Kumarsahu,Prabhat Kumar,Rachata Phondi,Wachiravit Modecrua,Krittanon Kaewtawee,Krittin Pachtrachai,Touchapon Kraisingkorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ROAD框架用于自动提示优化，绕过对精制数据集需求，经实验验证高效且能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法依赖大量标注数据集，而实际软件工程中初始阶段缺乏此类数据。

Method: 将优化视为动态调试调查，采用多智能体架构，包括分析器、优化器和教练，将非结构化失败日志转换为决策树协议。

Result: 在标准学术基准和实时生产知识管理引擎评估中，成功率提升5.6%，搜索准确率提升3.8%，在零售领域复杂推理任务中性能相对基线提升约19%。

Conclusion: 模仿人类故障分析和修复工程循环是资源密集型强化学习训练的可行、数据高效替代方案。

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on large, labeled gold-standard development sets to compute fitness scores for evolutionary or Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline. These findings suggest that mimicking the human engineering loop of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.

### [6] [LoongFlow: Directed Evolutionary Search via a Cognitive Plan-Execute-Summarize Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24077)
*Chunhui Wan,Xunan Dai,Zhuo Wang,Minglei Li,Yanpeng Wang,Yinan Mao,Yu Lan,Zhiwen Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 传统进化方法缺乏结构化推理阻碍大语言模型向自我改进代理转变，本文提出LoongFlow框架，结合LLM和混合进化记忆系统，在算法发现和管道优化中表现优异，进化效率超领先基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统进化方法在大语言模型向自我改进代理转变中缺乏结构化推理、易过早收敛和探索低效的问题。

Method: 引入LoongFlow框架，将LLM集成到“Plan - Execute - Summarize”范式，结合多岛模型、MAP - Elites和自适应玻尔兹曼选择的混合进化记忆系统。

Result: 在AlphaEvolve基准和Kaggle竞赛中，LoongFlow进化效率比领先基线高60%，能发现更优解。

Conclusion: LoongFlow在自主科学发现上取得重要进展，能以更低计算成本生成专家级解决方案。

Abstract: The transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-improving agents is hindered by the lack of structured reasoning in traditional evolutionary approaches. Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces. To address these challenges, we introduce LoongFlow, a self-evolving agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art solution quality with significantly reduced computational costs. Unlike "blind" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions. LoongFlow marks a substantial step forward in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling the generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead.

### [7] [CogRec: A Cognitive Recommender Agent Fusing Large Language Models and Soar for Explainable Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24113)
*Jiaxin Hu,Tao Wang,Bingsan Yang,Hongrun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文针对大语言模型在推荐系统中的局限及认知架构知识获取难题，提出结合二者优势的认知推荐代理CogRec，实验显示其在多方面有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在“黑盒”特性、知识幻觉和在线学习能力有限等问题，认知架构知识获取困难，为解决这些问题提出研究。

Method: 提出CogRec，以Soar为核心符号推理引擎，用大语言模型进行知识初始化，基于PCA循环运行，遇困境动态查询大语言模型并通过Soar分块机制生成新规则。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的广泛评估表明，CogRec在推荐准确性、可解释性和解决长尾问题方面有显著优势。

Conclusion: CogRec结合大语言模型和Soar认知架构优势，能持续更新知识库，为推荐提供可解释理由，在多方面表现良好。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity in understanding user preferences for recommendation systems. However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent "Black-Box" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.

### [8] [Graph-Based Exploration for ARC-AGI-3 Interactive Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24156)
*Evgenii Rudakov,Jonathan Shock,Benjamin Ultan Cowley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出无训练基于图的方法解决ARC - AGI - 3基准中的交互推理任务，表现优于前沿大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的大语言模型无法可靠解决ARC - AGI - 3基准中的游戏类交互推理任务。

Method: 结合基于视觉的帧处理和使用图结构表示的系统状态空间探索，分割视觉帧、基于视觉显著性对动作排序、维护探索状态和转换的有向图。

Result: 在ARC - AGI - 3预览挑战中，该方法在六个游戏中平均解决52个关卡中的30个，在私有排行榜上排名第三，大幅优于基于大语言模型的代理。

Conclusion: 即使不学习，显式图结构探索可作为交互推理的强大基线，强调在稀疏反馈环境中系统状态跟踪和动作优先级排序的重要性。

Abstract: We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics. The code is open source and available at https://github.com/dolphin-in-a-coma/arc-agi-3-just-explore.

Conclusion: SCP为可扩展、多机构、代理驱动的科学建立了必要的基础设施。

Abstract: We introduce SCP: the Science Context Protocol, an open-source standard designed to accelerate discovery by enabling a global network of autonomous scientific agents. SCP is built on two foundational pillars: (1) Unified Resource Integration: At its core, SCP provides a universal specification for describing and invoking scientific resources, spanning software tools, models, datasets, and physical instruments. This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility. By standardizing scientific context and tool orchestration at the protocol level, SCP establishes essential infrastructure for scalable, multi-institution, agent-driven science.

*Pengfu Wan,Jiawei Chen,Gangyan Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于深度强化学习的方法解决FSMVRP问题，在随机生成实例和基准数据集上实验效果好，有实际应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSMVRP因需同时决策车队组成和路线规划导致复杂度高，在大规模和时间受限环境下挑战大，需有效解决方法。

Method: 将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，开发名为FRIPN的策略网络，整合车队组成和路线规划决策，采用针对不同决策目标的输入嵌入。

Result: 在随机生成实例和基准数据集上实验，方法在计算效率和可扩展性上优势明显，尤其在大规模和时间受限场景。

Conclusion: 方法有实际应用潜力，为将基于DRL的技术扩展到VRP其他变体提供启示。

Abstract: The Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) is a prominent variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), extensively studied in operations research and computational science. FSMVRP requires simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios such as short-term vehicle rental and on-demand logistics. However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a novel policy network, termed FRIPN, that seamlessly integrates fleet composition and routing decisions. Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained scenarios. These strengths highlight the potential of our approach for practical applications and provide valuable inspiration for extending DRL-based techniques to other variants of VRP.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出风险感知逐步对齐方法RSA，解决现有安全对齐方法风险控制不足问题，实现高有用性和强安全性，抑制尾部风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法在风险中性范式下，难以解决参考策略偏差风险和应对低概率高危害行为，需改进风险控制。

Method: 提出RSA方法，将风险感知纳入策略优化过程，将安全对齐表述为令牌级风险感知约束策略优化问题，通过逐步对齐过程求解。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保证强安全性的同时实现高有用性，显著抑制尾部风险。

Conclusion: RSA方法能有效解决现有安全对齐方法的局限性，在风险控制方面有良好表现。

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.

Motivation: 为在部分可观测条件下运行的大语言模型（LLM）代理，找到不依赖基于梯度更新或额外训练的方法进行探索性推理。

Method: 代理维护环境状态的外部结构化信念，通过行动条件观察迭代更新，利用轻量级LLM替代估计信息增益，通过新奖励评估与真实环境配置的一致性。

Conclusion: 所提出的测试时自适应代理有效可行，能在不依赖复杂更新与训练情况下提升模型与潜在世界状态的对齐表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a test-time adaptive agent that performs exploratory inference through posterior-guided belief refinement without relying on gradient-based updates or additional training for LLM agent operating under partial observability. Our agent maintains an external structured belief over the environment state, iteratively updates it via action-conditioned observations, and selects actions by maximizing predicted information gain over the belief space. We estimate information gain using a lightweight LLM-based surrogate and assess world alignment through a novel reward that quantifies the consistency between posterior belief and ground-truth environment configuration. Experiments show that our method outperforms inference-time scaling baselines such as prompt-augmented or retrieval-enhanced LLMs, in aligning with latent world states with significantly lower integration overhead.

Conclusion: 通过综合研究关键组件，能找到JEPA - WMs模型的最优方法，提升规划效果。

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 现有FM空间能力评估忽视空间理解的交互性和经验驱动性，需分析FM智能体在地图环境中的表现以实现可靠的基于地图的推理和应用。

Method: 提出交互式评估框架，让智能体逐步探索局部可观测的网格地图，通过六种空间任务评估空间理解，系统改变多种FM的探索策略、记忆表征和推理方案。

Result: 探索主要影响经验获取，对最终推理精度影响有限；记忆表征在巩固空间经验中起核心作用，结构化记忆可提升性能；推理方案影响存储知识的使用；空间推理性能在特定阈值后饱和。

Conclusion: 提升基于地图的空间理解需要针对空间表征和推理的机制，而非仅靠扩展模型规模。

Abstract: Map environments provide a fundamental medium for representing spatial structure. Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of Large Language Models, or LLMs, in mathematical reasoning has been the focus of several recent studies. However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly serving as autonomous agents, and their utilization of external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is considered a future trend. Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness. To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency. Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations. All code is open-source at Github.

Result: RLMs能处理超出模型上下文窗口两个数量级的输入，在四个长上下文任务上显著优于基础LLM和常见长上下文支架。

Conclusion: RLMs在处理长提示上有良好效果且成本可控。

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.

Abstract: This paper proposes a group deliberation oriented multi-agent conversational model to address the limitations of single large language models in complex reasoning tasks. The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent. The model achieves higher reasoning efficiency than mainstream multi-agent approaches, providing an effective and stable solution for complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Youtu - Agent框架有效解决现有问题，在多个任务上表现良好。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\%) and GAIA (72.8\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\% and +5.4\% respectively. Moreover, our Agent RL training achieves 40\% speedup with steady performance improvement on 7B LLMs, enhancing coding/reasoning and searching capabilities respectively up to 35\% and 21\% on Maths and general/multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

Abstract: Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.

Conclusion: GenZ模型能发现特定数据集模式，效果优于仅依赖基础模型领域知识的方法。

Abstract: We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.

Abstract: Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.

Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.

The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous vehicle research in Poland.

Motivation: 探索迭代部署大语言模型对模型属性的影响

Result: 规划技能显著提升，后期模型有泛化能力，迭代部署与强化学习相关

Conclusion: 迭代部署一方面在AI安全领域有潜在影响，另一方面可作为一种替代显式强化学习的训练方式

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

Method: 构建支持超十种特定领域工具的稳定工具环境；采用分层数据整理框架筛选高质量数据；使用级联训练方法，包括种子SFT阶段、二次SFT阶段和最终RL阶段。

Result: STAgent在TravelBench上有出色表现，在多种通用基准测试中保留通用能力。

Conclusion: 提出的代理模型STAgent有效。

Abstract: We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.

Abstract: This study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%. This benchmarking study moves toward formalizing the assessment of LLM-based BEMS AI agents and identifying future research directions, emphasizing the trade-off between response accuracy and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 评估阿曼不同地区风能潜力，为风电场选址提供依据。

Method: 利用气象站风速观测记录，计算威布尔分布参数，预测归一化年发电量，统计分析风向。

Result: 确定4个多风地点，给出超6m/s风速概率及归一化年发电量，图姆赖特风况最佳。

Conclusion: 图姆赖特凭借风速和风向优势，是建设公用事业规模风电场的理想地点。

Abstract: Using observation records of wind speeds from weather stations in the Sultanate of Oman between 2000 and 2023, we compute estimators of the two Weibull distribution parameters (namely, the Weibull distribution's shape parameter and the Weibull distribution's scale parameter) in 10 weather station locations within eight Omani governorates. The 10 weather station locations in Oman and their corresponding governorates are Seeb (in Muscat), Salalah (in Dhofar), Buraimi (in Al Buraimi), Masirah (in Ash Sharqiyah South), Thumrait (in Dhofar), Sur (in Ash Sharqiyah South), Khasab (in Musandam), Sohar (in Sohar), Fahud (in Az Zahirah), and Saiq (in Ad Dakhiliyah). The obtained wind speed distributions at these weather stations are then used to predict the annual energy production (AEP) for a proposed reference amount of 1 MWp of wind turbine capacity, and this specific AEP is designated here by the term "normalized annual energy production (NAEP)." The direction of the wind is also analyzed statistically over the same period to identify the more probable wind directions. Four locations were clearly distinguishable as being windy compared to the others. The simulated probability of exceeding a feasible 6 m/s (21.6 km/h) wind speed in these locations is 41.71% in Thumrait, 37.77% in Masirah, 29.53% in Sur, and 17.03% in Fahud. The NAEP values in these four locations are estimated as 1.727 GWh/MWp/year, 1.419 GWh/MWp/year, 1.038 GWh/MWp/year, and 0.602 GWh/MWp/year, respectively. The wind in the location of Thumrait is not only the fastest (on average) among the selected locations but also the most unidirectional, blowing almost always from the south-south-east (SSE) direction, and both features make this non-coastal location in southern Oman, with an altitude of about 467 m, an attractive site for utility-scale wind farms.

Conclusion: 联邦客户分析能实质性提高网络竞争市场中的风险管理有效性和客户关系管理成果。

Abstract: Financial institutions face escalating challenges in identifying high-risk customer behaviors within massive transaction networks, where fraudulent activities exploit market fragmentation and institutional boundaries. We address three fundamental problems in customer risk analytics: data silos preventing holistic relationship assessment, extreme behavioral class imbalance, and suboptimal customer intervention strategies that fail to balance compliance costs with relationship value. We develop an integrated customer intelligence framework combining federated learning, relational network analysis, and adaptive targeting policies. Our federated graph neural network enables collaborative behavior modeling across competing institutions without compromising proprietary customer data, using privacy-preserving embeddings to capture cross-market relational patterns. We introduce cross-bank Personalized PageRank to identify coordinated behavioral clusters providing interpretable customer network segmentation for risk managers. A hierarchical reinforcement learning mechanism optimizes dynamic intervention targeting, calibrating escalation policies to maximize prevention value while minimizing customer friction and operational costs. Analyzing 1.4 million customer transactions across seven markets, our approach reduces false positive and false negative rates to 4.64% and 11.07%, substantially outperforming single-institution models. The framework prevents 79.25% of potential losses versus 49.41% under fixed-rule policies, with optimal market-specific targeting thresholds reflecting heterogeneous customer base characteristics. These findings demonstrate that federated customer analytics materially improve both risk management effectiveness and customer relationship outcomes in networked competitive markets.

Conclusion: Hojabr能解决现有系统碎片化问题，实现跨领域优化技术的系统推理和复用。

Abstract: Modern data analytics pipelines increasingly combine relational queries, graph processing, and tensor computation within a single application, but existing systems remain fragmented across paradigms, execution models, and research communities. This fragmentation results in repeated optimization efforts, limited interoperability, and strict separation between logical abstractions and physical execution strategies.
  We propose Hojabr as a unified declarative intermediate language to address this problem. Hojabr integrates relational algebra, tensor algebra, and constraint-based reasoning within a single higher-order algebraic framework, in which joins, aggregations, tensor contractions, and recursive computations are expressed uniformly. Physical choices, such as join algorithms, execution models, and sparse versus dense tensor representations, are handled as constraint-specialization decisions rather than as separate formalisms. Hojabr supports bidirectional translation with existing declarative languages, enabling programs to be both lowered into Hojabr for analysis and optimization and lifted back into their original declarative form. By making semantic, structural, and algebraic properties explicit, and by supporting extensibility across the compilation stack, Hojabr enables systematic reasoning and reuse of optimization techniques across database systems, machine learning frameworks, and compiler infrastructures.

Motivation: 现有交互式算法在处理含数百属性的高维数据集时，存在无法扩展或需过多用户交互的问题。

Method: 提出新框架FHDR以处理高维数据集的交互式查询。

Result: 实验显示FHDR在执行时间上至少比已知最佳算法快一个数量级，在所需交互次数上快几个数量级。

Conclusion: FHDR建立了可扩展交互式后悔最小化的新标杆。

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision making in large databases is very important in real world applications. Recently, an interactive query has been studied extensively in the database literature with the advantage of both the top-k query (with limited output size) and the skyline query (which does not require users to explicitly specify their preference function). This approach iteratively asks the user to select the one preferred within a set of options. Based on rounds of feedback, the query learns the implicit preference and returns the most favorable as a recommendation.
  However, many modern applications in areas like housing or financial product markets feature datasets with hundreds of attributes. Existing interactive algorithms either fail to scale or require excessive user interactions (often exceeding 1000 rounds). Motivated by this, we propose FHDR (Fast High-Dimensional Reduction), a novel framework that takes less than 0.01s with fewer than 30 rounds of interaction. It is considered a breakthrough in the field of interactive queries since most, if not all, existing studies are not scalable to high-dimensional datasets.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that FHDR outperforms the best-known algorithms by at least an order of magnitude in execution time and up to several orders of magnitude in terms of the number of interactions required, establishing a new state of the art for scalable interactive regret minimization.

Motivation: 现有学习型索引仅优化有限目标，忽略更新效率和稳定性等维度，且缺乏理论保证、通用性受限。

Method: 提出LMIndex框架，利用高效查询/更新顶层结构和最优误差阈值训练算法；开发LMG变体，采用新的间隙分配策略。

Result: LMG在批量加载、点查询、范围查询、更新、稳定性和空间使用等方面表现出色，有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: LMG有效打破现有方法的多维性能权衡，提供了平衡通用的框架。

Abstract: Index structures are fundamental for efficient query processing on large-scale datasets. Learned indexes model the indexing process as a prediction problem to overcome the inherent trade-offs of traditional indexes. However, most existing learned indexes optimize only for limited objectives like query latency or space usage, neglecting other practical evaluation dimensions such as update efficiency and stability. Moreover, many learned indexes rely on assumptions about data distributions or workloads, lacking theoretical guarantees when facing unknown or evolving scenarios, which limits their generality in real-world systems.
  In this paper, we propose LMIndex, a robust framework for learned indexing that leverages a efficient query/update top-layer structure (theoretically $O(1)$ when the key type is fixed) and a efficient optimal error threshold training algorithm (approach $O(1)$ in practice). Building upon this, we develop LMG (LMIndex with gaps), a variant employing a novel gap allocation strategy to enhance update performance and maintain stability under dynamic workloads. Extensive evaluations show that LMG achieves competitive or leading performance, including bulk loading (up to 8.25$\times$ faster), point queries (up to 1.49$\times$ faster), range queries (up to 4.02$\times$ faster than B+Tree), update (up to 1.5$\times$ faster on read-write workloads), stability (up to 82.59$\times$ lower coefficient of variation), and space usage (up to 1.38$\times$ smaller). These results demonstrate that LMG effectively breaks the multi-dimensional performance trade-offs inherent in state-of-the-art approaches, offering a balanced and versatile framework.

Abstract: Cloud data pipelines increasingly operate under dynamic workloads, evolving schemas, cost constraints, and strict governance requirements. Despite advances in cloud-native orchestration frameworks, most production pipelines rely on static configurations and reactive operational practices, resulting in prolonged recovery times, inefficient resource utilization, and high manual overhead. This paper presents Agentic Cloud Data Engineering, a policy-aware control architecture that integrates bounded AI agents into the governance and control plane of cloud data pipelines. In Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform, specialized agents analyze pipeline telemetry and metadata, reason over declarative cost and compliance policies, and propose constrained operational actions such as adaptive resource reconfiguration, schema reconciliation, and automated failure recovery. All agent actions are validated against governance policies to ensure predictable and auditable behavior. We evaluate Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform using representative batch and streaming analytics workloads constructed from public enterprise-style datasets. Experimental results show that Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform reduces mean pipeline recovery time by up to 45%, lowers operational cost by approximately 25%, and decreases manual intervention events by over 70% compared to static orchestration, while maintaining data freshness and policy compliance. These results demonstrate that policy-bounded agentic control provides an effective and practical approach for governing cloud data pipelines in enterprise environments.

Abstract: Edge computing enables latency-critical applications to process data close to end devices, yet task heterogeneity and limited resources pose significant challenges to efficient orchestration. This paper presents a measurement-driven, container-based resource management framework for intra-node optimization on a single edge server hosting multiple heterogeneous applications. Extensive profiling experiments are conducted to derive a nonlinear fitting model that characterizes the relationship among CPU/memory allocations and processing latency across diverse workloads, enabling reliable estimation of performance under varying configurations and providing quantitative support for subsequent optimization. Using this model and a queueing-based delay formulation, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly minimize system latency and power consumption, which is shown to be NP-hard. The problem is decomposed into tractable convex subproblems and solved through a two-stage container-based resource management scheme (CRMS) combining convex optimization and greedy refinement. The proposed scheme achieves polynomial-time complexity and supports quasi-dynamic execution under global resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that CRMS reduces latency by over 14\% and improves energy efficiency compared with heuristic and search-based baselines, offering a practical and scalable solution for heterogeneous edge environments with dynamic workload characteristics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables mobile edge devices, functioning as clients, to collaboratively train a decentralized model while ensuring local data privacy. However, the efficiency of FL in wireless networks is limited not only by constraints on communication and computational resources but also by significant data heterogeneity among clients, particularly in large-scale networks. This paper first presents a theoretical analysis of the impact of client data heterogeneity on global model generalization error, which can result in repeated training cycles, increased energy consumption, and prolonged latency. Based on the theoretical insights, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize learning latency and energy consumption while constraining generalization error. A joint client selection and resource allocation (CSRA) approach is then proposed, employing a series of convex optimization and relaxation techniques. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CSRA scheme yields higher test accuracy, reduced learning latency, and lower energy consumption compared to baseline methods that do not account for data heterogeneity.

Motivation: 基于Transformer的大语言模型在长上下文推理中因KV缓存的高内存需求面临挑战。

Method: 提出PackKV框架，采用专门针对KV缓存数据特性的有损压缩技术，协同设计压缩算法和系统架构。

Result: 在相同最小精度下降下，K缓存和V缓存内存缩减率分别提高153.2%和179.6%；在A100和RTX Pro 6000 GPU上，K和V的平均吞吐量分别提高75.7%和171.7%，且降低GPU内存带宽需求。

Conclusion: PackKV是一种高效的通用KV缓存管理框架，能有效解决长上下文推理的内存问题，提升执行效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across a wide range of practical applications. However, long-context inference remains a significant challenge due to the substantial memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to several gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present \textbf{PackKV}, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-context generation. %, which synergistically supports both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference scenarios. PackKV introduces novel lossy compression techniques specifically tailored to the characteristics of KV cache data, featuring a careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach is compatible with the dynamically growing nature of the KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that, under the same and minimum accuracy drop as state-of-the-art quantization methods, PackKV achieves, on average, \textbf{153.2}\% higher memory reduction rate for the K cache and \textbf{179.6}\% for the V cache. Furthermore, PackKV delivers extremely high execution throughput, effectively eliminating decompression overhead and accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation. Specifically, PackKV achieves an average throughput improvement of \textbf{75.7}\% for K and \textbf{171.7}\% for V across A100 and RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, compared to cuBLAS matrix-vector multiplication kernels, while demanding less GPU memory bandwidth.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型和基础模型规模扩大，检查点/恢复操作产生大数据I/O问题，现有内核加速I/O库在大语言模型检查点方面的有效性未充分研究。

Method: 开发微基准测试，量化使用liburing时的权衡，评估聚合、对齐和I/O合并在缓冲和直接I/O下的相互作用。

Conclusion: 需要与现代文件系统和I/O后端相匹配的聚合和合并策略。

Abstract: As LLMs and foundation models scale, checkpoint/restore has become a critical pattern for training and inference. With 3D parallelism (tensor, pipeline, data), checkpointing involves many processes, each managing numerous tensors of varying shapes and sizes, that must be persisted frequently to stable storage (e.g., parallel file systems). This turns checkpoint/restore into a big-data I/O problem characterized by volume, variety, and velocity. The workflow must traverse the full storage stack -- from GPU memory through host memory and local storage to external repositories -- whose tiers differ by orders of magnitude in performance, creating bottlenecks under concurrency even with asynchronous flush/prefetch. Kernel-accelerated I/O libraries such as \texttt{liburing} may mitigate these issues versus POSIX, but their effectiveness for LLM checkpointing remains underexplored. We develop microbenchmarks to quantify trade-offs when using \texttt{liburing}, evaluating how aggregation, alignment, and I/O coalescing interact under buffered and direct I/O. We find that uncoalesced small-buffer operations halve throughput relative to synthetic workloads, while file system-aware aggregation restores bandwidth and reduces metadata overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM checkpointing engines, our approach achieves up to $3.9\times$ higher write throughput than DataStates-LLM and $7.6\times$ higher than TorchSnapshot. These results highlight the need for aggregation and coalescing strategies that align with modern file systems and I/O backends.

Abstract: With the development of large-scale models, traditional distributed bilevel optimization algorithms cannot be applied directly in low-resource clients. The key reason lies in the excessive computation involved in optimizing both the lower- and upper-level functions. Thus, we present the first resource-adaptive distributed bilevel optimization framework with a second-order free hypergradient estimator, which allows each client to optimize the submodels adapted to the available resources. Due to the coupled influence of partial outer parameters x and inner parameters y, it's challenging to theoretically analyze the upper bound regarding the globally averaged hypergradient for full model parameters. The error bound of inner parameter also needs to be reformulated since the local partial training. The provable theorems show that both RABO and RAFBO can achieve an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{C_x^{\ast}Q})$, which is dominated by the minimum coverage of the outer parameter $C_x^{\ast}$. Extensive experiments on two different tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and computation efficiency of our proposed methods.

Abstract: Modern cloud-native systems increasingly rely on multi-cluster deployments to support scalability, resilience, and geographic distribution. However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness of intelligent, self-adaptive infrastructure management as a key enabler for scalable and resilient cloud platforms.

Motivation: 现代机器学习训练和推理使用大量GPU，网络故障恢复慢，常见网络错误会导致整个作业终止，浪费大量GPU时间。

Method: 利用多网卡硬件，执行快速连接迁移、带宽感知负载重新分配和弹性集体算法。

Result: 在两个8 - GPU H100 InfiniBand服务器和大规模ML模拟器上评估，对NIC故障高度鲁棒，训练开销小于1%，推理开销小于3%，性能优于AdapCC和DejaVu。

Conclusion: R²CCL是一种有效的容错通信库，能在网络故障时减少开销，提高性能。

Abstract: Modern ML training and inference now span tens to tens of thousands of GPUs, where network faults can waste 10--15\% of GPU hours due to slow recovery. Common network errors and link fluctuations trigger timeouts that often terminate entire jobs, forcing expensive checkpoint rollback during training and request reprocessing during inference. We present R$^2$CCL, a fault-tolerant communication library that provides lossless, low-overhead failover by exploiting multi-NIC hardware. R$^2$CCL performs rapid connection migration, bandwidth-aware load redistribution, and resilient collective algorithms to maintain progress under failures. We evaluate R$^2$CCL on two 8-GPU H100 InfiniBand servers and via large-scale ML simulators modeling hundreds of GPUs with diverse failure patterns. Experiments show that R$^2$CCL is highly robust to NIC failures, incurring less than 1\% training and less than 3\% inference overheads. R$^2$CCL outperforms baselines AdapCC and DejaVu by 12.18$\times$ and 47$\times$, respectively.

Abstract: The Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) theorem states that a set of points in high-dimensional space can be embedded into a lower-dimensional space while approximately preserving pairwise distances with high probability Johnson and Lindenstrauss (1984). The standard JL theorem uses dense random matrices with Gaussian entries. However, for some applications, sparse random matrices are preferred as they allow for faster matrix-vector multiplication. I outline the constructions and proofs introduced by Achlioptas (2003) and the contemporary standard by Kane and Nelson (2014). Further, I implement and empirically compare these sparse constructions with standard Gaussian JL matrices.

Abstract: The kidney exchange mechanism allows many patient-donor pairs who are otherwise incompatible with each other to come together and exchange kidneys along a cycle. However, due to infrastructure and legal constraints, kidney exchange can only be performed in small cycles in practice. In reality, there are also some altruistic donors who do not have any paired patients. This allows us to also perform kidney exchange along paths that start from some altruistic donor. Unfortunately, the computational task is NP-complete. To overcome this computational barrier, an important line of research focuses on designing faster algorithms, both exact and using the framework of parameterized complexity.
  The standard parameter for the kidney exchange problem is the number $t$ of patients that receive a healthy kidney. The current fastest known deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem, parameterized by $t$, is $O^\star\left(14^t\right)$. In this work, we improve this by presenting a deterministic FPT algorithm that runs in time $O^\star\left((4e)^t\right)\approx O^\star\left(10.88^t\right)$. This problem is also known to be W[1]-hard parameterized by the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph. A natural question here is whether the kidney exchange problem admits an FPT algorithm parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We answer this negatively in this paper by proving that this problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by the pathwidth of the underlying undirected graph. We also present some parameterized intractability results improving the current understanding of the problem under the framework of parameterized complexity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the directed global minimum vertex-cut problem: given a directed vertex-weighted graph $G$, compute a vertex-cut $(L,S,R)$ in $G$ of minimum value, which is defined to be the total weight of all vertices in $S$. The problem, together with its edge-based variant, is one of the most basic in graph theory and algorithms, and has been studied extensively. The fastest currently known algorithm for directed global minimum vertex-cut (Henzinger, Rao and Gabow, FOCS 1996 and J. Algorithms 2000) has running time $\tilde{O}(mn)$, where $m$ and $n$ denote the number of edges and vertices in the input graph, respectively. A long line of work over the past decades led to faster algorithms for other main versions of the problem, including the undirected edge-based setting (Karger, STOC 1996 and J. ACM 2000), directed edge-based setting (Cen et al., FOCS 2021), and undirected vertex-based setting (Chuzhoy and Trabelsi, STOC 2025). However, for the vertex-based version in directed graphs, the 29 year-old $\tilde{O}(mn)$-time algorithm of Henzinger, Rao and Gabow remains the state of the art to this day, in all edge-density regimes. In this paper we break the $Θ(mn)$ running time barrier for the first time, by providing a randomized algorithm for directed global minimum vertex-cut, with running time $O\left(mn^{0.976}\cdot\operatorname{polylog} W\right)$ where $W$ is the ratio of largest to smallest vertex weight. Additionally, we provide a randomized $O\left(\min\left\{m^{1+o(1)}\cdot k,n^{2+o(1)}\right\}\right)$-time algorithm for the unweighted version of directed global minimum vertex-cut, where $k$ is the value of the optimal solution. The best previous algorithm for the problem achieved running time $\tilde O\left(\min\left\{k^2 \cdot m, mn^{11/12+o(1)}, n^{2+o(1)}\right\}\right)$ (Forster et al., SODA 2020, Li et al., STOC 2021).

Abstract: We study the problem of fair $k$-committee selection under an egalitarian objective. Given $n$ agents partitioned into $m$ groups (\eg, demographic quotas), the goal is to aggregate their preferences to form a committee of size $k$ that guarantees minimum representation from each group while minimizing the maximum \emph{cost} incurred by any agent. We model this setting as the ordinal fair $k$-center problem, where agents are embedded in an unknown metric space, and each agent reports a complete preference ranking (i.e., ordinal information) over all agents, consistent with the underlying distance metric (i.e., cardinal information). The cost incurred by an agent with respect to a committee is defined as its distance to the closest committee member. The quality of an algorithm is evaluated using the notion of distortion, which measures the worst-case ratio between the cost of the committee produced by the algorithm and the cost of an optimal committee, when given complete access to the underlying metric space.
  When cardinal information is not available, no constant distortion is possible for the ordinal $k$-center problem, even without fairness constraints, when $k\geq 3$ [Burkhardt et.al., AAAI'24]. To overcome this hardness, we allow limited access to cardinal information by querying the metric space. In this setting, our main contribution is a factor-$5$ distortion algorithm that requires only $O(k \log^2 k)$ queries. Along the way, we present an improved factor-$3$ distortion algorithm using $O(k^2)$ queries.

Abstract: Genome rearrangement distances are an established method in genome comparison. Works in this area may include various rearrangement operations representing large-scale mutations, gene orientation information, the number of nucleotides in intergenic regions, and weights reflecting the expected frequency of each operation. In this article, we model genomes containing at most one copy of each gene by considering gene sequences, with orientations, and representing intergenic regions according to their nucleotide lengths. We looked at a problem called Weighted Reversal, Transposition, and Indel Distance, which seeks the minimal cost sequence composed by the rearrangement operations of reversals, transposition, and indels, capable of transforming one genome into another. We leverage a structure called Labeled Intergenic Breakpoint Graph to show an algorithm for that problem with guaranteed approximations considering some sets of weights for the operations.

Abstract: We consider a recently introduced fair repetitive scheduling problem involving a set of clients, each asking for their associated job to be daily scheduled on a single machine across a finite planning horizon. The goal is to determine a job processing permutation for each day, aiming to minimize the maximum total completion time experienced by any client. This problem is known to be NP-hard for quite restrictive settings, with previous work offering exact solution methods for highly-structured special cases.
  In this paper, we focus on the design of approximation algorithms with provable performance guarantees. Our main contributions can be briefly summarized as follows:
  (i) When job processing times are day-dependent, we devise a polynomial-time LP-based $2$-approximation, as well as a polynomial-time approximation scheme for a constant number of days.
  (ii) With day-invariant processing times, we obtain a surprisingly simple $(\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2}+ε)$-approximation in polynomial time. This setting is also shown to admit a quasi-polynomial-time approximation scheme for an arbitrary number of days.
  The key technical component driving our approximation schemes is a novel batching technique, where jobs are conceptually grouped into batches, subsequently leading either to a low-dimensional dynamic program or to a compact configuration LP. Concurrently, while developing our constant-factor approximations, we propose a host of lower-bounding mechanisms that may be of broader interest.

Abstract: The concept of fair orientations in graphs was introduced by Christodoulou, Fiat, Koutsoupias, and Sgouritsa in 2023, naturally modeling fair division scenarios in which resources are only contested by neighbors. In this model, vertices represent agents and undirected edges represent goods; edges have to be oriented towards one of their endpoints, i.e., allocated to one of their adjacent agents. Although EFX orientations (envy-free up to any good) have been extensively studied in this setting, EF orientations (envy-free) remain unexplored. In this work, we initiate their study, mostly under the lens of parameterized complexity, presenting various tractable cases, hardness results, and parameterizations. Our results concern both simple graphs and multigraphs. Interestingly, many of our results transfer to EFX orientations, thus complementing and improving upon previous work; notably, we answer an open question regarding the structural parameterized complexity of the latter problem on graphs of polynomially-bounded valuations. We also show that EF orientations are tractable in cases in which EFX orientations are not, particularly for binary valuations. Lastly, we consider charity in the orientation setting, establishing algorithms for finding the minimum amount of edges that have to be removed from a graph in order for EF(X) orientations to exist.

Result: 高效策略在A/B测试中使收入提高4.5%；刻画了模型下最大化长期平均收入的最优策略结构。

Conclusion: 所提策略和模型有效，能更好地针对促销敏感客户，学习客户间的跨期模式，提高收入。

Abstract: Partnering with a large online retailer, we consider the problem of sending daily personalized promotions to a userbase of over 20 million customers. We propose an efficient policy for determining, every day, the promotion that each customer should receive (10%, 12%, 15%, 17%, or 20% off), while respecting global allocation constraints. This policy was successfully deployed to see a 4.5% revenue increase during an A/B test, by better targeting promotion-sensitive customers and also learning intertemporal patterns across customers.
  We also consider theoretically modeling the intertemporal state of the customer. The data suggests a simple new combinatorial model of pricing with reference effects, where the customer remembers the best promotion they saw over the past $\ell$ days as the "reference value", and is more likely to purchase if this value is poor. We tightly characterize the structure of optimal policies for maximizing long-run average revenue under this model -- they cycle between offering poor promotion values $\ell$ times and offering good values once.

Conclusion: 提出的两种算法在多级资源公平分配问题上有较好表现，满足不同需求。

Abstract: We introduce the concept of multilevel fair allocation of resources with tree-structured hierarchical relations among agents. While at each level it is possible to consider the problem locally as an allocation of an agent to its children, the multilevel allocation can be seen as a trace capturing the fact that the process is iterated until the leaves of the tree. In principle, each intermediary node may have its own local allocation mechanism. The main challenge is then to design algorithms which can retain good fairness and efficiency properties. In this paper we propose two original algorithms under the assumption that leaves of the tree have matroid-rank utility functions and the utility of any internal node is the sum of the utilities of its children. The first one is a generic polynomial-time sequential algorithm that comes with theoretical guarantees in terms of efficiency and fairness. It operates in a top-down fashion -- as commonly observed in real-world applications -- and is compatible with various local algorithms. The second one extends the recently proposed General Yankee Swap to the multilevel setting. This extension comes with efficiency guarantees only, but we show that it preserves excellent fairness properties in practice.

Abstract: Given the stated preferences of several people over a number of proposals regarding public policy initiatives, some of those proposals might be judged to be more ``divisive'' than others. When designing online participatory platforms to support digital democracy initiatives enabling citizens to deliberate over such proposals, we might wish to equip those platforms with the functionality to retrieve the most divisive proposals currently under discussion. Such a service would be useful for analysing the progress of deliberation and steering discussion towards issues that still require further debate. Guided by this use case, we explore possibilities for providing a clear definition of what it means to select a set of most divisive proposals on the basis of people's stated preferences over proposals. Then, employing the axiomatic method familiar from social choice theory, we show that the task of selecting the most divisive proposals in a manner that satisfies certain seemingly mild normative requirements faces a number of fundamental difficulties.

Abstract: Incorporating item-side information, such as category and brand, into sequential recommendation is a well-established and effective approach for improving performance. However, despite significant advancements, current models are generally limited by three key challenges: they often overlook the fine-grained temporal dynamics inherent in timestamps, exhibit vulnerability to noise in user interaction sequences, and rely on computationally expensive fusion architectures. To systematically address these challenges, we propose the Time-Aware Adaptive Side Information Fusion (TASIF) framework. TASIF integrates three synergistic components: (1) a simple, plug-and-play time span partitioning mechanism to capture global temporal patterns; (2) an adaptive frequency filter that leverages a learnable gate to denoise feature sequences adaptively, thereby providing higher-quality inputs for subsequent fusion modules; and (3) an efficient adaptive side information fusion layer, this layer employs a "guide-not-mix" architecture, where attributes guide the attention mechanism without being mixed into the content-representing item embeddings, ensuring deep interaction while ensuring computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that TASIF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining excellent efficiency in training.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, reducing hallucinations and compensating for outdated information. However, recent studies have exposed a critical vulnerability in RAG pipelines corpus poisoning where adversaries inject malicious documents into the retrieval corpus to manipulate model outputs. In this work, we propose two complementary retrieval-stage defenses: RAGPart and RAGMask. Our defenses operate directly on the retriever, making them computationally lightweight and requiring no modification to the generation model. RAGPart leverages the inherent training dynamics of dense retrievers, exploiting document partitioning to mitigate the effect of poisoned points. In contrast, RAGMask identifies suspicious tokens based on significant similarity shifts under targeted token masking. Across two benchmarks, four poisoning strategies, and four state-of-the-art retrievers, our defenses consistently reduce attack success rates while preserving utility under benign conditions. We further introduce an interpretable attack to stress-test our defenses. Our findings highlight the potential and limitations of retrieval-stage defenses, providing practical insights for robust RAG deployments.

Conclusion: MaRCA框架有效解决了大规模推荐系统中的计算资源分配问题，能在现有资源下提升业务收入。

Abstract: Modern recommender systems face significant computational challenges due to growing model complexity and traffic scale, making efficient computation allocation critical for maximizing business revenue. Existing approaches typically simplify multi-stage computation resource allocation, neglecting inter-stage dependencies, thus limiting global optimality. In this paper, we propose MaRCA, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for end-to-end computation resource allocation in large-scale recommender systems. MaRCA models the stages of a recommender system as cooperative agents, using Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) to optimize revenue under computation resource constraints. We introduce an AutoBucket TestBench for accurate computation cost estimation, and a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Revenue-Cost Balancer to proactively forecast traffic loads and adjust the revenue-cost trade-off accordingly. Since its end-to-end deployment in the advertising pipeline of a leading global e-commerce platform in November 2024, MaRCA has consistently handled hundreds of billions of ad requests per day and has delivered a 16.67% revenue uplift using existing computation resources.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前利用大语言模型进行基于文本的可解释推荐时，解释与可用证据的事实一致性问题未被充分探索。

Method: 设计基于提示的管道，用大语言模型从评论中提取原子解释语句，构建基准；提出结合大语言模型和自然语言推理的语句级对齐指标。

Result: 在六个先进可解释推荐模型实验中，模型语义相似度得分高，但事实性指标表现差。

Conclusion: 可解释推荐需事实感知评估，研究为开发更可信解释系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Text-based explainable recommendation aims to generate natural-language explanations that justify item recommendations, to improve user trust and system transparency. Although recent advances leverage LLMs to produce fluent outputs, a critical question remains underexplored: are these explanations factually consistent with the available evidence? We introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating the factual consistency of text-based explainable recommenders. We design a prompting-based pipeline that uses LLMs to extract atomic explanatory statements from reviews, thereby constructing a ground truth that isolates and focuses on their factual content. Applying this pipeline to five categories from the Amazon Reviews dataset, we create augmented benchmarks for fine-grained evaluation of explanation quality. We further propose statement-level alignment metrics that combine LLM- and NLI-based approaches to assess both factual consistency and relevance of generated explanations. Across extensive experiments on six state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models, we uncover a critical gap: while models achieve high semantic similarity scores (BERTScore F1: 0.81-0.90), all our factuality metrics reveal alarmingly low performance (LLM-based statement-level precision: 4.38%-32.88%). These findings underscore the need for factuality-aware evaluation in explainable recommendation and provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy explanation systems.

Motivation: 在大语言模型时代，共指消解中监督神经方法潜力未充分挖掘，增量聚类面临长文本效率和性能平衡挑战。

Method: 提出MEIC - DT，有双阈值约束机制控制输入规模，采用SAES进行智能缓存管理，引入IRP保全语义完整性。

Result: 在常见基准测试上，MEIC - DT在严格内存约束下实现了极具竞争力的共指性能。

Conclusion: MEIC - DT能在严格内存限制下有效应对共指消解的增量聚类问题。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), supervised neural methods remain the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for Coreference Resolution. Yet, their full potential is underexplored, particularly in incremental clustering, which faces the critical challenge of balancing efficiency with performance for long texts. To address the limitation, we propose \textbf{MEIC-DT}, a novel dual-threshold, memory-efficient incremental clustering approach based on a lightweight Transformer. MEIC-DT features a dual-threshold constraint mechanism designed to precisely control the Transformer's input scale within a predefined memory budget. This mechanism incorporates a Statistics-Aware Eviction Strategy (\textbf{SAES}), which utilizes distinct statistical profiles from the training and inference phases for intelligent cache management. Furthermore, we introduce an Internal Regularization Policy (\textbf{IRP}) that strategically condenses clusters by selecting the most representative mentions, thereby preserving semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate that MEIC-DT achieves highly competitive coreference performance under stringent memory constraints.

TL;DR: 提出 MDiffFR 方法解决联邦推荐中的冷启动物品问题，理论上有更强隐私保证，实验表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦推荐因隐私约束使得新物品冷启动问题严峻，现有解决方案建模能力不足且易致嵌入不对齐。

Method: 在服务器使用定制扩散模型生成新物品嵌入，分发到客户端进行冷启动推理，利用预训练模态编码器提取特征引导逆向去噪过程。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法比现有基于映射的方法有更强隐私保证；在四个真实数据集上的实验显示该方法始终优于所有基线。

Conclusion: MDiffFR 是解决联邦推荐中冷启动物品问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Federated recommendations (FRs) provide personalized services while preserving user privacy by keeping user data on local clients, which has attracted significant attention in recent years. However, due to the strict privacy constraints inherent in FRs, access to user-item interaction data and user profiles across clients is highly restricted, making it difficult to learn globally effective representations for new (cold-start) items. Consequently, the item cold-start problem becomes even more challenging in FRs. Existing solutions typically predict embeddings for new items through the attribute-to-embedding mapping paradigm, which establishes a fixed one-to-one correspondence between item attributes and their embeddings. However, this one-to-one mapping paradigm often fails to model varying data distributions and tends to cause embedding misalignment, as verified by our empirical studies. To this end, we propose MDiffFR, a novel generation-based modality-guided diffusion method for cold-start items in FRs. In this framework, we employ a tailored diffusion model on the server to generate embeddings for new items, which are then distributed to clients for cold-start inference. To align item semantics, we deploy a pre-trained modality encoder to extract modality features as conditional signals to guide the reverse denoising process. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed method achieves stronger privacy guarantees compared to existing mapping-based approaches. Extensive experiments on four real datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms all baselines in FRs.

Abstract: While the OneRec series has successfully unified the fragmented recommendation pipeline into an end-to-end generative framework, a significant gap remains between recommendation systems and general intelligence. Constrained by isolated data, they operate as domain specialists-proficient in pattern matching but lacking world knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and instruction following. This limitation is further compounded by the lack of a holistic benchmark to evaluate such integrated capabilities. To address this, our contributions are: 1) RecIF Bench & Open Data: We propose RecIF-Bench, a holistic benchmark covering 8 diverse tasks that thoroughly evaluate capabilities from fundamental prediction to complex reasoning. Concurrently, we release a massive training dataset comprising 96 million interactions from 160,000 users to facilitate reproducible research. 2) Framework & Scaling: To ensure full reproducibility, we open-source our comprehensive training pipeline, encompassing data processing, co-pretraining, and post-training. Leveraging this framework, we demonstrate that recommendation capabilities can scale predictably while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge. 3) OneRec-Foundation: We release OneRec Foundation (1.7B and 8B), a family of models establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across all tasks in RecIF-Bench. Furthermore, when transferred to the Amazon benchmark, our models surpass the strongest baselines with an average 26.8% improvement in Recall@10 across 10 diverse datasets (Figure 1). This work marks a step towards building truly intelligent recommender systems. Nonetheless, realizing this vision presents significant technical and theoretical challenges, highlighting the need for broader research engagement in this promising direction.

Conclusion: HiGR 框架有效且高效，能提升推荐质量。

Abstract: Slate recommendation, where users are presented with a ranked list of items simultaneously, is widely adopted in online platforms. Recent advances in generative models have shown promise in slate recommendation by modeling sequences of discrete semantic IDs autoregressively. However, existing autoregressive approaches suffer from semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential decoding that lacks holistic slate planning. To address these limitations, we propose HiGR, an efficient generative slate recommendation framework that integrates hierarchical planning with listwise preference alignment. First, we propose an auto-encoder utilizing residual quantization and contrastive constraints to tokenize items into semantically structured IDs for controllable generation. Second, HiGR decouples generation into a list-level planning stage for global slate intent, followed by an item-level decoding stage for specific item selection. Third, we introduce a listwise preference alignment objective to directly optimize slate quality using implicit user feedback. Experiments on our large-scale commercial media platform demonstrate that HiGR delivers consistent improvements in both offline evaluations and online deployment. Specifically, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in offline recommendation quality with a 5x inference speedup, while further achieving a 1.22% and 1.73% increase in Average Watch Time and Average Video Views in online A/B tests.

Abstract: Search relevance plays a central role in web e-commerce. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant results on relevance task, existing benchmarks lack sufficient complexity for comprehensive model assessment, resulting in an absence of standardized relevance evaluation metrics across the industry. To address this limitation, we propose Rule-Aware benchmark with Image for Relevance assessment(RAIR), a Chinese dataset derived from real-world scenarios. RAIR established a standardized framework for relevance assessment and provides a set of universal rules, which forms the foundation for standardized evaluation. Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance. RAIR data are now available, serving as an industry benchmark for relevance assessment while providing new insights into general LLM and Visual Language Model(VLM) evaluation.

Abstract: Online gaming is a popular activity involving the adoption of complex systems and network infrastructures. The relevance of gaming, which generates large amounts of market revenue, drove research in modeling network devices' behavior to evaluate bandwidth consumption, predict and sustain high loads, and detect malicious activity. In this context, process mining appears promising due to its ability to combine data-driven analyses with model-based insights. In this paper, we propose a process mining-based method that analyzes gaming network traffic, allowing: unsupervised characterization of different states from gaming network data; encoding such states through process mining into interpretable Petri nets; and classification of gaming network traffic data to identify different video games being played. We apply the method to the UPSIDE case study, involving gaming network data of several devices interacting with two video games: Clash Royale and Rocket League. Results demonstrate that the gaming network behavior can be effectively and interpretably modeled through states represented as Petri nets with sufficient coherence (94.02% inter-device similarity) and specificity (174.99% inter-state separation) while maintaining a good classification accuracy of the two different video games (73.84% AUC).

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has been widely adopted in diverse industrial domains, including autonomous driving, intelligent healthcare, and aided programming. Like traditional software, DL systems are also prone to faults, whose malfunctioning may expose users to significant risks. Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects. These insights highlight promising directions for future exploration in this field.

Abstract: For complex simulation problems, inferring parameters of scientific interest often precludes the use of classical likelihood-based techniques due to intractable likelihood functions. Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\mathbfθ$ given observed data $\mathbf{x}_{\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.

Abstract: We present TabMixNN, a flexible PyTorch-based deep learning framework that synthesizes classical mixed-effects modeling with modern neural network architectures for tabular data analysis. TabMixNN addresses the growing need for methods that can handle hierarchical data structures while supporting diverse outcome types including regression, classification, and multitask learning. The framework implements a modular three-stage architecture: (1) a mixed-effects encoder with variational random effects and flexible covariance structures, (2) backbone architectures including Generalized Structural Equation Models (GSEM) and spatial-temporal manifold networks, and (3) outcome-specific prediction heads supporting multiple outcome families. Key innovations include an R-style formula interface for accessibility, support for directed acyclic graph (DAG) constraints for causal structure learning, Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) kernels for spatial modeling, and comprehensive interpretability tools including SHAP values and variance decomposition. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility through applications to longitudinal data analysis, genomic prediction, and spatial-temporal modeling. TabMixNN provides a unified interface for researchers to leverage deep learning while maintaining the interpretability and theoretical grounding of classical mixed-effects models.

Abstract: This study presents a large-scale predictive modeling framework for logP prediction using 426850 bioactive compounds rigorously curated from the intersection of three authoritative chemical databases: PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules. We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures.

Abstract: Human-level concept learning argues that humans typically learn new concepts from a single example, whereas machine learning algorithms typically require hundreds of samples to learn a single concept. Our brain subconsciously identifies important features and learns more effectively. \vspace*{6pt}
  Contribution: In this paper, we present the Coordinate Matrix Machine (CM$^2$). This purpose-built small model augments human intelligence by learning document structures and using this information to classify documents. While modern "Red AI" trends rely on massive pre-training and energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, CM$^2$ is designed as a Green AI solution. It achieves human-level concept learning by identifying only the structural "important features" a human would consider, allowing it to classify very similar documents using only one sample per class.
  Advantage: Our algorithm outperforms traditional vectorizers and complex deep learning models that require larger datasets and significant compute. By focusing on structural coordinates rather than exhaustive semantic vectors, CM$^2$ offers: 1. High accuracy with minimal data (one-shot learning) 2. Geometric and structural intelligence 3. Green AI and environmental sustainability 4. Optimized for CPU-only environments 5. Inherent explainability (glass-box model) 6. Faster computation and low latency 7. Robustness against unbalanced classes 8. Economic viability 9. Generic, expandable, and extendable

Conclusion: 现代语言模型保留了使风洞环境下实现贝叶斯推理的几何特征，并沿此特征组织近似贝叶斯更新。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that small transformers trained in controlled "wind-tunnel'' settings can implement exact Bayesian inference, and that their training dynamics produce a geometric substrate -- low-dimensional value manifolds and progressively orthogonal keys -- that encodes posterior structure. We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.
  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate.

The resulting evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using learned evidence. However, the Subjective-Logic framework constrains evidence to be non-negative, requiring specific activation functions whose geometric properties can induce activation-dependent learning-freeze behavior: a regime where gradients become extremely small for samples mapped into low-evidence regions. We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark classification problems (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), two few-shot classification problems, and blind face restoration problem empirically validate the developed theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generalized regularized evidential models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RTRL和E - prop多研究单层循环动力学学习，而大脑学习跨多层，需处理深度和时间上的层级动态，因此要扩展E - prop框架到深层网络。

Method: 推导跨深度的新递归关系，将E - prop的资格迹扩展到更深层。

Result: 展示了一种在线学习算法能同时在时间和深度上进行准确的信用分配。

Conclusion: 可在无时间反向传播的情况下训练深度循环网络。

Abstract: Recurrent networks are typically trained with backpropagation through time (BPTT). However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time.

Conclusion: HINTS具有实用价值，能有效提取人类因素用于时间序列预测，并具有良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Human decision-making, emotions, and collective psychology are complex factors that shape the temporal dynamics observed in financial and economic systems. Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent factors endogenously from time series residuals without external data. HINTS leverages the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model as a structural inductive bias to model evolving social influence, memory, and bias patterns. The extracted human factors are integrated into a state-of-the-art backbone model as an attention map. Experimental results using nine real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that HINTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, multiple case studies and ablation studies validate the interpretability of HINTS, demonstrating strong semantic alignment between the extracted factors and real-world events, demonstrating the practical utility of HINTS.

Conclusion: MUSIC是一种灵活有效的建模部分观测系统和不完整物理知识的方法。

Abstract: Advances in data acquisition and computational methods have accelerated the use of differential equation based modelling for complex systems. Such systems are often described by coupled (or more) variables, yet governing equation is typically available for one variable, while the remaining variable can be accessed only through data. This mismatch between known physics and observed data poses a fundamental challenge for existing physics-informed machine learning approaches, which generally assume either complete knowledge of the governing equations or full data availability across all variables. In this paper, we introduce MUSIC (Multitask Learning Under Sparse and Incomplete Constraints), a sparsity induced multitask neural network framework that integrates partial physical constraints with data-driven learning to recover full-dimensional solutions of coupled systems when physics-constrained and data-informed variables are mutually exclusive. MUSIC employs mesh-free (random) sampling of training data and sparsity regularization, yielding highly compressed models with improved training and evaluation efficiency. We demonstrate that MUSIC accurately learns solutions (shock wave solutions, discontinuous solutions, pattern formation solutions) to complex coupled systems under data-scarce and noisy conditions, consistently outperforming non-sparse formulations. These results highlight MUSIC as a flexible and effective approach for modeling partially observed systems with incomplete physical knowledge.

Conclusion: SVBF - LBG方案能提高聚类纯度，且保留下游分析所需的数学结构。

Abstract: In many classification and clustering tasks, it is useful to compute a geometric representative for a dataset or a cluster, such as a mean or median. When datasets are represented by subspaces, these representatives become points on the Grassmann or flag manifold, with distances induced by their geometry, often via principal angles. We introduce a subspace clustering algorithm that replaces subspace means with a trainable prototype defined as a Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) - a subspace that comes as close as possible to intersecting each cluster member in at least one fixed direction. Integrated in the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline, this SVBF-LBG scheme yields improved cluster purity on synthetic, image, spectral, and video action data, while retaining the mathematical structure required for downstream analysis.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the architectural design process of deep neural networks (DNN), has attracted increasing attention. Multimodal DNNs that necessitate feature fusion from multiple modalities benefit from NAS due to their structural complexity; however, constructing an architecture for multimodal DNNs through NAS requires a substantial amount of labeled training data. Thus, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for architecture search of multimodal DNNs. The proposed method applies SSL comprehensively for both the architecture search and model pretraining processes. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method successfully designed architectures for DNNs from unlabeled training data.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) represents an efficient and popular approach for network traffic classification. However, network traffic classification is a challenging domain, and trained models may degrade soon after deployment due to the obsolete datasets and quick evolution of computer networks as new or updated protocols appear. Moreover, significant change in the behavior of a traffic type (and, therefore, the underlying features representing the traffic) can produce a large and sudden performance drop of the deployed model, known as a data or concept drift. In most cases, complete retraining is performed, often without further investigation of root causes, as good dataset quality is assumed. However, this is not always the case and further investigation must be performed. This paper proposes a novel methodology to evaluate the stability of datasets and a benchmark workflow that can be used to compare datasets.
  The proposed framework is based on a concept drift detection method that also uses ML feature weights to boost the detection performance. The benefits of this work are demonstrated on CESNET-TLS-Year22 dataset. We provide the initial dataset stability benchmark that is used to describe dataset stability and weak points to identify the next steps for optimization. Lastly, using the proposed benchmarking methodology, we show the optimization impact on the created dataset variants.

Conclusion: NODE是一种有效的逆问题最优实验设计方法，能提升重建准确性和任务性能。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Optimal Design of Experiments, a learning-based framework for optimal experimental design in inverse problems that avoids classical bilevel optimization and indirect sparsity regularization. NODE jointly trains a neural reconstruction model and a fixed-budget set of continuous design variables representing sensor locations, sampling times, or measurement angles, within a single optimization loop. By optimizing measurement locations directly rather than weighting a dense grid of candidates, the proposed approach enforces sparsity by design, eliminates the need for l1 tuning, and substantially reduces computational complexity. We validate NODE on an analytically tractable exponential growth benchmark, on MNIST image sampling, and illustrate its effectiveness on a real world sparse view X ray CT example. In all cases, NODE outperforms baseline approaches, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy and task-specific performance.

Conclusion: ZTA - FL框架有效提升了IIoT的安全性，同时给出理论分析、故障模式表征并开源代码以便复现。

Abstract: Recent attacks on critical infrastructure, including the 2021 Oldsmar water treatment breach and 2023 Danish energy sector compromises, highlight urgent security gaps in Industrial IoT (IIoT) deployments. While Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative intrusion detection, existing frameworks remain vulnerable to Byzantine poisoning attacks and lack robust agent authentication. We propose Zero-Trust Agentic Federated Learning (ZTA-FL), a defense in depth framework combining: (1) TPM-based cryptographic attestation achieving less than 0.0000001 false acceptance rate, (2) a novel SHAP-weighted aggregation algorithm providing explainable Byzantine detection under non-IID conditions with theoretical guarantees, and (3) privacy-preserving on-device adversarial training. Comprehensive experiments across three IDS benchmarks (Edge-IIoTset, CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15) demonstrate that ZTA-FL achieves 97.8 percent detection accuracy, 93.2 percent accuracy under 30 percent Byzantine attacks (outperforming FLAME by 3.1 percent, p less than 0.01), and 89.3 percent adversarial robustness while reducing communication overhead by 34 percent. We provide theoretical analysis, failure mode characterization, and release code for reproducibility.

Conclusion: 分析了生成式分类器的归纳偏差和决定其优于判别式分类器的数据特性。

Abstract: Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.

Conclusion: CENNSurv能建模复杂时间模式，可扩展性好，为研究累积效应的研究者提供有可解释性见解的实用工具。

Abstract: In epidemiological research, modeling the cumulative effects of time-dependent exposures on survival outcomes presents a challenge due to their intricate temporal dynamics. Conventional spline-based statistical methods, though effective, require repeated data transformation for each spline parameter tuning, with survival analysis computations relying on the entire dataset, posing difficulties for large datasets. Meanwhile, existing neural network-based survival analysis methods focus on accuracy but often overlook the interpretability of cumulative exposure patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce CENNSurv, a novel deep learning approach that captures dynamic risk relationships from time-dependent data. Evaluated on two diverse real-world datasets, CENNSurv revealed a multi-year lagged association between chronic environmental exposure and a critical survival outcome, as well as a critical short-term behavioral shift prior to subscription lapse. This demonstrates CENNSurv's ability to model complex temporal patterns with improved scalability. CENNSurv provides researchers studying cumulative effects a practical tool with interpretable insights.

Conclusion: 所提的混合矩阵设计方案能有效解决无线网络中DFL每节点最大能耗最小化问题。

Abstract: We consider the design of mixing matrices to minimize the operation cost for decentralized federated learning (DFL) in wireless networks, with focus on minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption. As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes. Our evaluations based on real data have validated the efficacy of the proposed solution in combining the low energy consumption of sparse mixing matrices and the fast convergence of dense mixing matrices.

Conclusion: MERINDA能为边缘实时监测自主系统带来准确且可解释的模型恢复。

Abstract: Physical AI at the edge -- enabling autonomous systems to understand and predict real-world dynamics in real time -- requires hardware-efficient learning and inference. Model recovery (MR), which identifies governing equations from sensor data, is a key primitive for safe and explainable monitoring in mission-critical autonomous systems operating under strict latency, compute, and power constraints. However, state-of-the-art MR methods (e.g., EMILY and PINN+SR) rely on Neural ODE formulations that require iterative solvers and are difficult to accelerate efficiently on edge hardware. We present \textbf{MERINDA} (Model Recovery in Reconfigurable Dynamic Architecture), an FPGA-accelerated MR framework designed to make physical AI practical on resource-constrained devices. MERINDA replaces expensive Neural ODE components with a hardware-friendly formulation that combines (i) GRU-based discretized dynamics, (ii) dense inverse-ODE layers, (iii) sparsity-driven dropout, and (iv) lightweight ODE solvers. The resulting computation is structured for streaming parallelism, enabling critical kernels to be fully parallelized on the FPGA. Across four benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, MERINDA delivers substantial gains over GPU implementations: \textbf{114$\times$ lower energy} (434~J vs.\ 49{,}375~J), \textbf{28$\times$ smaller memory footprint} (214~MB vs.\ 6{,}118~MB), and \textbf{1.68$\times$ faster training}, while matching state-of-the-art model-recovery accuracy. These results demonstrate that MERINDA can bring accurate, explainable MR to the edge for real-time monitoring of autonomous systems.

Result: 在标准和具有挑战性的Safety Gymnasium任务实验中，SB - TRPO比现有方法更能平衡安全性和任务完成度。

Conclusion: SB - TRPO算法能有效解决硬约束强化学习中安全和奖励平衡的问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical domains requires agents to maximise rewards while strictly adhering to safety constraints. Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned. Experiments on standard and challenging Safety Gymnasium tasks show that SB-TRPO consistently achieves the best balance of safety and meaningful task completion compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Futures are contracts obligating the exchange of an asset at a predetermined date and price, notable for their high leverage and liquidity and, therefore, thrive in the Crypto market. RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, yet many of its most effective methods rely on access to large amounts of labeled data or extensive online interaction. In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making. Overall, this dissertation advances the theoretical foundations of interactive learning by developing algorithms that are statistically optimal and computationally efficient, while also providing principled guidance for deploying interactive learning methods in large-scale, real-world settings.

TL;DR: 文章引入并研究GLA和GCA两种替代损失函数族，进行理论分析和实验，结果显示两者在多类不平衡分类中表现优于传统损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接最小化平衡分类损失难以处理，因此需要设计有效的替代损失函数。

Method: 引入GLA和GCA损失函数族，对其一致性进行理论分析，并通过实验验证性能。

Result: GLA损失族是贝叶斯一致，仅对完整假设集为H-一致；GCA损失族对有界或完整假设集都为H-一致，理论保证更强。实验中，两者都优于传统损失函数，GLA在常见基准表现稍好，GCA在高度不平衡场景有优势。

Conclusion: GLA和GCA损失函数族在多类不平衡分类问题中有更好的性能，可有效解决直接最小化平衡分类损失的难题。

Abstract: The balanced loss is a widely adopted objective for multi-class classification under class imbalance. By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\mathsf p_{\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\sqrt{\mathsf p_{\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings.

Result: 框架明确了运筹学角色从求解器到护栏再到系统架构师的转变。

Conclusion: 框架元素定义了安全关键、对可靠性敏感的操作领域保障自主性的研究议程。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is shifting from conversational assistants toward agentic systems -- autonomous decision-making systems that sense, decide, and act within operational workflows. This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.

Motivation: 从理论角度研究语言模型在偏好标签受隐私约束和/或对抗性损坏情况下的私有和鲁棒对齐问题。

Method: 建立离线和在线设置下次优差距的上限，分析隐私优先和损坏优先两种交互情况，使用不同损失函数和算法。

Conclusion: 新的一致收敛保证在学习理论和统计中有广泛应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the private and robust alignment of language models from a theoretical perspective by establishing upper bounds on the suboptimality gap in both offline and online settings. We consider preference labels subject to privacy constraints and/or adversarial corruption, and analyze two distinct interplays between them: privacy-first and corruption-first. For the privacy-only setting, we show that log loss with an MLE-style algorithm achieves near-optimal rates, in contrast to conventional wisdom. For the joint privacy-and-corruption setting, we first demonstrate that existing offline algorithms in fact provide stronger guarantees -- simultaneously in terms of corruption level and privacy parameters -- than previously known, which further yields improved bounds in the corruption-only regime. In addition, we also present the first set of results for private and robust online alignment. Our results are enabled by new uniform convergence guarantees for log loss and square loss under privacy and corruption, which we believe have broad applicability across learning theory and statistics.

TL;DR: 本文提出多尺度SSM框架（MS - SSM），通过多分辨率处理增强记忆效率和长程建模能力，实验表明其优于现有SSM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SSM模型有效记忆有限、难以捕捉多尺度依赖，为解决这些局限提出多尺度SSM框架。

Method: 引入多尺度SSM框架，以多分辨率表示序列动态并使用专门的状态空间动态处理每个分辨率；引入依赖输入的尺度混合器来实现不同分辨率间的动态信息融合。

Result: 在多个基准测试上，如Long Range Arena、层次推理、时间序列分类和图像识别，MS - SSM始终优于先前基于SSM的模型。

Conclusion: MS - SSM显著改善了序列建模，尤其是在长程和层次任务上，同时保持计算效率，凸显了状态空间架构中多分辨率处理的优势。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently attention as an efficient alternative to computationally expensive attention-based models for sequence modeling. They rely on linear recurrences to integrate information over time, enabling fast inference, parallelizable training, and control over recurrence stability. However, traditional SSMs often suffer from limited effective memory, requiring larger state sizes for improved recall. Moreover, existing SSMs struggle to capture multi-scale dependencies, which are essential for modeling complex structures in time series, images, and natural language. This paper introduces a multi-scale SSM framework that addresses these limitations by representing sequence dynamics across multiple resolution and processing each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics. By capturing both fine-grained, high-frequency patterns and coarse, global trends, MS-SSM enhances memory efficiency and long-range modeling. We further introduce an input-dependent scale-mixer, enabling dynamic information fusion across resolutions. The proposed approach significantly improves sequence modeling, particularly in long-range and hierarchical tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, including Long Range Arena, hierarchical reasoning, time series classification, and image recognition, demonstrate that MS-SSM consistently outperforms prior SSM-based models, highlighting the benefits of multi-resolution processing in state-space architectures.

Conclusion: 配对种子评估在实践中弱占优，有相关性时提高统计可靠性，无相关性时等效于独立评估且不失有效性。

Abstract: Machine learning systems appear stochastic but are deterministically random, as seeded pseudorandom number generators produce identical realisations across executions. Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains. Paired seed evaluation is weakly dominant in practice, improving statistical reliability when correlation is present and reducing to independent evaluation without loss of validity when it is not.

Result: 在ETT、Exchange和Weather等基准数据集上，Bridge - TS在均方误差和平均绝对误差方面达到插补精度新纪录。

Conclusion: 改进生成式时间序列插补的先验具有优越性。

Abstract: Time series imputation, i.e., filling the missing values of a time recording, finds various applications in electricity, finance, and weather modelling. Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets such as ETT, Exchange, and Weather show that Bridge-TS reaches a new record of imputation accuracy in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, demonstrating the superiority of improving prior for generative time series imputation.

Result: 在语言建模、常识推理、召回密集型任务和时间序列等实验中，Trellis架构优于强基线，且序列越长性能提升越明显。

Conclusion: Trellis架构有潜力用于长上下文应用。

Abstract: Transformers, while powerful, suffer from quadratic computational complexity and the ever-growing Key-Value (KV) cache of the attention mechanism. This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory. To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time. Extensive experiments on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive tasks, and time series show that the proposed architecture outperforms strong baselines. Notably, its performance gains increase as the sequence length grows, highlighting its potential for long-context applications.

Abstract: Neural processes (NPs) are a class of models that learn stochastic processes directly from data and can be used for inference, sampling and conditional sampling. We introduce a new NP model based on flow matching, a generative modeling paradigm that has demonstrated strong performance on various data modalities. Following the NP training framework, the model provides amortized predictions of conditional distributions over any arbitrary points in the data. Compared to previous NP models, our model is simple to implement and can be used to sample from conditional distributions using an ODE solver, without requiring auxiliary conditioning methods. In addition, the model provides a controllable tradeoff between accuracy and running time via the number of steps in the ODE solver. We show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural process methods on various benchmarks including synthetic 1D Gaussian processes data, 2D images, and real-world weather data.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效缩小了弱监督与高维统计之间的差距。

Abstract: High-dimensional learning problems, where the number of features exceeds the sample size, often require sparse regularization for effective prediction and variable selection. While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve predictive performance and variable selection accuracy comparable to fully supervised approaches, effectively bridging the gap between weak supervision and high-dimensional statistics.

Conclusion: 仅靠嵌入质量无法解决情感分类中的数据稀缺问题，资源有限时应考虑替代方法。

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis enhances market understanding; however, standard natural language processing approaches encounter significant challenges when applied to small datasets. This study provides a comparative evaluation of embedding-based methods for financial news sentiment classification in resource-constrained environments. Word2Vec, GloVe, and sentence transformer representations are evaluated in combination with gradient boosting on manually labeled headlines. Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics. The analysis demonstrates that pretrained embeddings yield diminishing returns below a critical data sufficiency threshold, and that small validation sets contribute to overfitting during model selection. Practical application is illustrated through weekly sentiment aggregation and narrative summarization for market monitoring workflows. The findings offer empirical evidence that embedding quality alone cannot address fundamental data scarcity in sentiment classification. For practitioners operating with limited resources, the results indicate the need to consider alternative approaches such as few-shot learning, data augmentation, or lexicon-enhanced hybrid methods when labeled samples are scarce.

Abstract: Speculative decoding improves LLM inference by generating and verifying multiple tokens in parallel, but existing systems suffer from suboptimal performance due to a mismatch between dynamic speculation and static runtime assumptions.

Yggdrasil introduces an equal-growth tree structure for static graph compatibility, a latency-aware optimization objective for draft selection, and stage-based scheduling to reduce overhead. Yggdrasil supports unmodified LLMs and achieves up to $3.98\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple hardware setups.

Conclusion: 小语言模型实现强大长上下文能力得益于如Infini - attention的架构内存。

Abstract: This study investigates small-scale pretraining for Small Language Models (SLMs) to enable efficient use of limited data and compute, improve accessibility in low-resource settings and reduce costs. To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences. Even so, Infini-attention still effectively compensates for the SLM's limited parameters. Particularly, despite performance degradation at a 16,384-token context, the Infini-attention model achieves up to 31% higher accuracy than the baseline. Our findings suggest that achieving robust long-context capability in SLMs benefits from architectural memory like Infini-attention.

Conclusion: MDBF有效提升大语言模型极低比特量化性能，同时保持了易于部署的推理原语。

Abstract: For extreme low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs), Double Binary Factorization (DBF) is attractive as it enables efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy. However, the scaling parameters of DBF are too restrictive; after factoring out signs, all rank components share the same magnitude profile, resulting in performance saturation. We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.

Abstract: Soft actor-critic (SAC) is a popular algorithm for max-entropy reinforcement learning. In practice, the energy-based policies in SAC are often approximated using simple policy classes for efficiency, sacrificing the expressiveness and robustness. In this paper, we propose a variant of the SAC algorithm that parameterizes the policy with flow-based models, leveraging their rich expressiveness. In the algorithm, we evaluate the flow-based policy utilizing the instantaneous change-of-variable technique and update the policy with an online variant of flow matching developed in this paper. This online variant, termed importance sampling flow matching (ISFM), enables policy update with only samples from a user-specified sampling distribution rather than the unknown target distribution. We develop a theoretical analysis of ISFM, characterizing how different choices of sampling distributions affect the learning efficiency. Finally, we conduct a case study of our algorithm on the max-entropy linear quadratic regulator problems, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm learns the optimal action distribution.

Abstract: Reliable forecasting of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is essential for mitigating the variability of solar energy in power grids. This study presents a comprehensive benchmark of ten deep learning architectures for short-term (1-hour ahead) GHI time series forecasting in Ho Chi Minh City, leveraging high-resolution NSRDB satellite data (2011-2020) to compare established baselines (e.g. LSTM, TCN) against emerging state-of-the-art architectures, including Transformer, Informer, iTransformer, TSMixer, and Mamba. Experimental results identify the Transformer as the superior architecture, achieving the highest predictive accuracy with an R^2 of 0.9696. The study further utilizes SHAP analysis to contrast the temporal reasoning of these architectures, revealing that Transformers exhibit a strong "recency bias" focused on immediate atmospheric conditions, whereas Mamba explicitly leverages 24-hour periodic dependencies to inform predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Knowledge Distillation can compress the high-performance Transformer by 23.5% while surprisingly reducing error (MAE: 23.78 W/m^2), offering a proven pathway for deploying sophisticated, low-latency forecasting on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Dense linear layers are a dominant source of computational and parametric cost in modern machine learning models, despite their quadratic complexity and often being misaligned with the compositional structure of learned representations. We introduce Stagewise Pairwise Mixers (SPM), a structured linear operator that replaces dense matrices with a composition of sparse pairwise-mixing stages. An SPM layer implements a global linear transformation in $O(nL)$ time with $O(nL)$ parameters, where $L$ is typically constant or $log_2n$, and admits exact closed-form forward and backward computations. SPM is designed as a drop-in replacement for dense linear layers in feedforward networks, recurrent architectures, attention mechanisms, etc. We derive complete forward and backward expressions for two parameterizations: an orthogonal norm-preserving rotation-based variant and a fully general $2 \times 2$ mixing variant. Beyond computational savings, the stagewise structure of SPM induces an explicit compositional inductive bias that constrains model capacity and improves generalization when aligned with task structure. We present proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating substantial reductions in wall-clock cost and improved accuracy on structured learning problems, while retaining competitive performance on real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Conventional deep learning prioritizes unconstrained optimization, yet biological systems operate under strict metabolic constraints. We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical "transition" regime maximizes generalization capability. These findings establish dynamical constraints as a distinct class of inductive bias, suggesting that robust AI development requires not only scaling and removing limitations, but computationally mastering the temporal characteristics that naturally promote generalization.

Conclusion: DivQAT算法能有效增强量化CNN抗提取攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their quantized counterparts are vulnerable to extraction attacks, posing a significant threat of IP theft. Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy. Furthermore, combining our quantization technique with other defense mechanisms improves their effectiveness compared to traditional QAT.

Abstract: Flood models inform strategic disaster management by simulating the spatiotemporal hydrodynamics of flooding. While physics-based numerical flood models are accurate, their substantial computational cost limits their use in operational settings where rapid predictions are essential. Models designed with graph neural networks (GNNs) provide both speed and accuracy while having the ability to process unstructured spatial domains. Given its flexible input and architecture, GNNs can be leveraged alongside physics-informed techniques with ease, significantly improving interpretability. This study introduces a novel flood GNN architecture, DUALFloodGNN, which embeds physical constraints at both global and local scales through explicit loss terms. The model jointly predicts water volume at nodes and flow along edges through a shared message-passing framework. To improve performance for autoregressive inference, model training is conducted with a multi-step loss enhanced with dynamic curriculum learning. Compared with standard GNN architectures and state-of-the-art GNN flood models, DUALFloodGNN achieves substantial improvements in predicting multiple hydrologic variables while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DataFlow是一个有效的用于构建、测试和部署高性能机器学习系统处理无界时间序列数据的计算框架。

Abstract: We present DataFlow, a computational framework for building, testing, and deploying high-performance machine learning systems on unbounded time-series data. Traditional data science workflows assume finite datasets and require substantial reimplementation when moving from batch prototypes to streaming production systems. This gap introduces causality violations, batch boundary artifacts, and poor reproducibility of real-time failures.
  DataFlow resolves these issues through a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time idempotency: outputs at any time t depend only on a fixed-length context window preceding t. This guarantee ensures that models developed in batch mode execute identically in streaming production without code changes. The framework enforces strict causality by automatically tracking knowledge time across all transformations, eliminating future-peeking bugs.
  DataFlow supports flexible tiling across temporal and feature dimensions, allowing the same model to operate at different frequencies and memory profiles via configuration alone. It integrates natively with the Python data science stack and provides fit/predict semantics for online learning, caching and incremental computation, and automatic parallelization through DAG-based scheduling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across domains including financial trading, IoT, fraud detection, and real-time analytics.

Motivation: 经典评估指标不能直接衡量高维数据投影到低维空间时信息的保留量。

Method: 引入基于香农熵和稳定秩的局部指标ERPM，用金融时间序列和文献中常见流形对比其与MRRE和Local Procrustes的结果。

Result: 基于距离的标准与几何和谱测度相关性低，ERPM与Local Procrustes平均相关性强但局部有差异。

Conclusion: ERPM能通过识别信息损失严重的邻域补充现有指标，有助于信息敏感应用中嵌入的综合评估。

Abstract: In this work we study the quality of low-dimensional embeddings from an explicitly information-theoretic perspective. We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators.

Result: 在六项任务实验中提升6.84%。

Conclusion: CLEAR - HUG能增强心脏传导表示，使模式与专家诊断指南对齐。

Abstract: The multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) stands as a cornerstone of cardiac diagnosis. Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG. This highlights its ability to enhance representations of cardiac conduction and align patterns with expert diagnostic guidelines.

Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) aims to encode structural and semantic dependencies of graph-structured data into low-dimensional embeddings. However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of geometrically grounded, sampling-free contrastive objectives for graph representation learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display strikingly different generalization behaviors: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often narrows capability, whereas reinforcement-learning (RL) tuning tends to preserve it. The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns. This work provides new insights into the nature of reasoning in LLMs and points toward principles for designing training strategies that foster broad, robust generalization.

Abstract: Lane-change intention prediction is safety-critical for autonomous driving and ADAS, but remains difficult in naturalistic traffic due to noisy kinematics, severe class imbalance, and limited generalization across heterogeneous highway scenarios. We propose Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI), a hybrid framework that fuses deep temporal representations with physics-inspired interaction cues. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s. TPI-AI outperforms standalone LightGBM and Bi-LSTM baselines, achieving macro-F1 of 0.9562, 0.9124, 0.8345 on highD and 0.9247, 0.8197, 0.7605 on exiD at T = 1, 2, 3 s, respectively. These results show that combining physics-informed interaction features with learned temporal embeddings yields robust multi-scenario lane-change intention prediction.

Abstract: This paper provides an ablation-based analysis of latent autoregression in GP-VAE models, building upon our previous work introducing the architecture. Language models typically rely on an autoregressive factorization over tokens. In contrast, our prior work proposed shifting sequential structure to the latent space through a causal Gaussian process, while using a non-autoregressive decoder. Here, we conduct a systematic ablation study of the role played by latent autoregression. We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior. These findings highlight the role of latent autoregression as an effective mechanism for organizing long-range structure, while remaining complementary to token-level autoregressive modeling. They should be interpreted as an empirical analysis of representational structure rather than as a proposal for a new architecture.

Abstract: We demonstrate an approach for LLMs to critique their \emph{own} answers with the goal of enhancing their performance that leads to significant improvements over established planning benchmarks. Despite the findings of earlier research that has cast doubt on the effectiveness of LLMs leveraging self critique methods, we show significant performance gains on planning datasets in the Blocksworld domain through intrinsic self-critique, without external source such as a verifier. We also demonstrate similar improvements on Logistics and Mini-grid datasets, exceeding strong baseline accuracies. We employ a few-shot learning technique and progressively extend it to a many-shot approach as our base method and demonstrate that it is possible to gain substantial improvement on top of this already competitive approach by employing an iterative process for correction and refinement. We illustrate how self-critique can significantly boost planning performance. Our empirical results present new state-of-the-art on the class of models considered, namely LLM model checkpoints from October 2024. Our primary focus lies on the method itself, demonstrating intrinsic self-improvement capabilities that are applicable regardless of the specific model version, and we believe that applying our method to more complex search techniques and more capable models will lead to even better performance.

Abstract: The presence of outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) weights and activations makes them difficult to quantize. Recent work has leveraged rotations to mitigate these outliers. In this work, we propose methods that learn fusible rotations by minimizing principled and cheap proxy objectives to the weight quantization error. We primarily focus on GPTQ as the quantization method. Our main method is OptRot, which reduces weight outliers simply by minimizing the element-wise fourth power of the rotated weights. We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting. We also propose a data-dependent method, OptRot$^{+}$, that further improves performance by incorporating information on the activation covariance. In the W4A4 setting, we see that both OptRot and OptRot$^{+}$ perform worse, highlighting a trade-off between weight and activation quantization.

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: While conformal prediction provides robust marginal coverage guarantees, achieving reliable conditional coverage for specific inputs remains challenging. Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile. We propose a three-headed quantile network that estimates these weights via finite differences using auxiliary quantile levels at \(1-α\pm δ\), subsequently fine-tuning the central quantile by optimizing the weighted loss. We provide a theoretical analysis with exact non-asymptotic guarantees characterizing the resulting excess risk. Extensive experiments on diverse high-dimensional real-world datasets demonstrate remarkable improvements in conditional coverage performance.

Abstract: Plasma kinetic equations exhibit pronounced sensitivity to microscopic perturbations in model parameters and data, making reliable and efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) essential for predictive simulations. However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension.

Abstract: Sepsis, characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, results in significant mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs. The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring. The models were initially tailored for a prediction window of one hour, later extended to four hours through transfer learning. The encouraging outcomes of this study suggest the potential for wearable technology to facilitate early sepsis detection outside ICU and ward environments.

Conclusion: 提出的SaM2B框架在无人机通信波束预测上具有优势，能解决现有多模态方法存在的问题。

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly expanding driven by urban air mobility, logistics drones, and aerial sensing, while fast and accurate beam prediction in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications is crucial for achieving reliable connectivity. Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the "multi-source representation beam semantics" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods.

Conclusion: TRL有效弥合了单模型效率和集成级可靠性之间的差距。

Abstract: Laplace approximations are among the simplest and most practical methods for approximate Bayesian inference in neural networks, yet their Euclidean formulation struggles with the highly anisotropic, curved loss surfaces and large symmetry groups that characterize modern deep models. Recent work has proposed Riemannian and geometric Gaussian approximations to adapt to this structure. Building on these ideas, we introduce the Tubular Riemannian Laplace (TRL) approximation. TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty. We interpret TRL as a scalable reparametrised Gaussian approximation that utilizes implicit curvature estimates to operate in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost. TRL effectively bridges the gap between single-model efficiency and ensemble-grade reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal intelligence development recently show strong progress in visual understanding and high level reasoning. Though, most reasoning system still reply on textual information as the main medium for inference. This limit their effectiveness in spatial tasks such as visual navigation and geo-localization. This work discuss about the potential scope of this field and eventually propose an idea visual reasoning paradigm Geo-Consistent Visual Planning, our introduced framework called Visual Reasoning for Localization, or ViReLoc, which performs planning and localization using only visual representations. The proposed framework learns spatial dependencies and geometric relations that text based reasoning often suffer to understand. By encoding step by step inference in the visual domain and optimizing with reinforcement based objectives, ViReLoc plans routes between two given ground images. The system also integrates contrastive learning and adaptive feature interaction to align cross view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences. Experiments across diverse navigation and localization scenarios show consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross view retrieval performance. These results establish visual reasoning as a strong complementary approach for navigation and localization, and show that such tasks can be performed without real time global positioning system data, leading to more secure navigation solutions.

Conclusion: 该框架将DDC模型的经典推断扩展到非参数奖励和现代机器学习工具，为IRL提供统一且易处理的统计推断方法。

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and dynamic discrete choice (DDC) models explain sequential decision-making by recovering reward functions that rationalize observed behavior. Flexible IRL methods typically rely on machine learning but provide no guarantees for valid inference, while classical DDC approaches impose restrictive parametric specifications and often require repeated dynamic programming. We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency. Our framework extends classical inference for DDC models to nonparametric rewards and modern machine-learning tools, providing a unified and computationally tractable approach to statistical inference in IRL.

Abstract: Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 联合生成模型在混沌系统预测上优于传统条件下一步模型。

Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems exhibit strong sensitivity to initial conditions and often contain unresolved multiscale processes, making deterministic forecasting fundamentally limited. Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data remains fundamentally limited by identifiability constraints. Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

Abstract: Data teams at frontier AI companies routinely train small proxy models to make critical decisions about pretraining data recipes for full-scale training runs. However, the community has a limited understanding of whether and when conclusions drawn from small-scale experiments reliably transfer to full-scale model training. In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of "fair" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training. We show that this approach yields relative performance that strongly correlates with that of fully tuned large-scale LLM pretraining runs. Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss. Empirically, we validate this approach across 23 data recipes covering four critical dimensions of data curation, demonstrating dramatic improvements in the reliability of small-scale experiments.

Abstract: Generating humorous memes is a challenging multimodal task that moves beyond direct image-to-caption supervision. It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality. Beyond memes, our work presents a general training paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation, where success is guided by comparative judgment within coherent output group.

Method: 提出Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR)，在因果解纠缠框架中引入生理结构先验，通过Structural Causal Model (SCM)分离不变病理形态和非因果伪影。

Result: 在PTB - XL数据集上，CPR显著优于标准临床预处理方法，在SAP攻击下F1分数达0.632，优于Median Smoothing 9.1%，且与Randomized Smoothing认证鲁棒性相当，保持单遍推理效率。

Conclusion: CPR能在鲁棒性、效率和临床可解释性间实现更好权衡。

Abstract: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.

Conclusion: DLCM能有效解决大语言模型计算资源分配问题，提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) apply uniform computation to all tokens, despite language exhibiting highly non-uniform information density. This token-uniform regime wastes capacity on locally predictable spans while under-allocating computation to semantically critical transitions. We propose $\textbf{Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM)}$, a hierarchical language modeling framework that learns semantic boundaries from latent representations and shifts computation from tokens to a compressed concept space where reasoning is more efficient. DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior. We introduce the first $\textbf{compression-aware scaling law}$, which disentangles token-level capacity, concept-level reasoning capacity, and compression ratio, enabling principled compute allocation under fixed FLOPs. To stably train this heterogeneous architecture, we further develop a $\textbf{decoupled $μ$P parametrization}$ that supports zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across widths and compression regimes. At a practical setting ($R=4$, corresponding to an average of four tokens per concept), DLCM reallocates roughly one-third of inference compute into a higher-capacity reasoning backbone, achieving a $\textbf{+2.69$\%$ average improvement}$ across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved strong performance in many real-world applications, yet targeted backdoor poisoning on heterogeneous graphs remains less studied. We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative training among users without relying on a central server. However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks.

Abstract: Despite the recent progresses, particularly in developing Language Models, there are fundamental challenges and unanswered questions about how such models can continually learn/memorize, self-improve, and find effective solutions. In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 所提出的DCL - DECOR方法能有效处理线性高斯系统中混合潜在混杂的因果发现问题。

Abstract: We study causal discovery from observational data in linear Gaussian systems affected by \emph{mixed latent confounding}, where some unobserved factors act broadly across many variables while others influence only small subsets. This setting is common in practice and poses a challenge for existing methods: differentiable and score-based DAG learners can misinterpret global latent effects as causal edges, while latent-variable graphical models recover only undirected structure.
  We propose \textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.
  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data.

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models. However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.
  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language processing tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous taxi services represent a transformative advancement in urban mobility, offering safety, efficiency, and round-the-clock operations. While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings.

Conclusion: 优化和推理是同一过程，训练后transformer的贝叶斯结构是目标几何的必然结果。

Abstract: Neural networks trained with standard objectives exhibit behaviors characteristic of probabilistic inference: soft clustering, prototype specialization, and Bayesian uncertainty tracking. These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\partial L / \partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.

Abstract: Precise probabilistic information about drug-target interaction (DTI) predictions is vital for understanding limitations and boosting predictive performance. Gaussian processes (GP) offer a scalable framework to integrate state-of-the-art DTI representations and Bayesian inference, enabling novel operations, such as Bayesian classification with rejection, top-$K$ selection, and ranking. We propose a deep kernel learning-based GP architecture (DTI-GP), which incorporates a combined neural embedding module for chemical compounds and protein targets, and a GP module. The workflow continues with sampling from the predictive distribution to estimate a Bayesian precedence matrix, which is used in fast and accurate selection and ranking operations. DTI-GP outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, and it allows (1) the construction of a Bayesian accuracy-confidence enrichment score, (2) rejection schemes for improved enrichment, and (3) estimation and search for top-$K$ selections and ranking with high expected utility.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has proven effective for enhancing model capabilities, yet standard preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model assumes transitivity, overlooking the inherent complexity of human population preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results. Experiments corroborate the theoretical strengths of $\mathtt{OMWU}$ in both tabular and neural policy classes, demonstrating its potential for LLM applications.

Conclusion: 新的多智能体选项发现方法能有效提高多智能体的协调能力。

Abstract: Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.

Abstract: High-quality reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) fields is critical for Atmosphere monitoring, yet current models remain constrained by the scarcity of complete training data and a lack of uncertainty quantification.To address these limitations, we propose AODDiff, a probabilistic reconstruction framework based on diffusion-based Bayesian inference. By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications.

Abstract: Transfer effects manifest themselves both during training using a fixed data set and in inductive inference using accumulating data. We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability. Evaluations are performed using a benchmark drug-target interaction data set. Our results show that learning curves can better capture the effects of multi-task learning and their multi-task extensions can delineate pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation models.

Abstract: Forecasting is critical in areas such as finance, biology, and healthcare. Despite the progress in the field, making accurate forecasts remains challenging because real-world time series contain both global trends, local fine-grained structure, and features on multiple scales in between. Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

Abstract: Cognitive task classification using machine learning plays a central role in decoding brain states from neuroimaging data. By integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, complex connectivity patterns can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomes. This process transforms raw blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals into interpretable representations of cognitive processes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) further advance this paradigm by modeling brain regions as nodes and functional connections as edges, capturing topological dependencies and multi-scale interactions that are often missed by conventional approaches. Our proposed SpectralBrainGNN model, a spectral convolution framework based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) computed via normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project-Task (HCPTask) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.25\%. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/gnnplayground/SpectralBrainGNN to support reproducibility and future research.

Conclusion: 所提框架将频繁子图挖掘和拓扑数据分析相结合，为拓扑感知特征提取提供新视角。

Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.

Conclusion: MSACL将李雅普诺夫理论与离策略演员-评论家框架相结合，为可验证的基于学习的安全控制奠定基础。

Abstract: Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $λ$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control. Source code and benchmark environments will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 为多学习问题中从稀疏候选者识别支持网络的顺序学习工具提供理论基础和改进的性能保证。

Abstract: Many modern AI and ML problems require evaluating partners' contributions through shared yet asymmetric, computationally intensive processes and the simultaneous selection of the most beneficial candidates. Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.
  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.
  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).

TL;DR: 引入Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs) 训练管道，在Gemma - 2 - 2B层12上蒸馏出197个特征核心，提升SAEBench指标并能跨稀疏级别转移特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）学习的特征冗余、难以跨训练和稀疏级别转移重用的问题。

Method: 采用迭代蒸馏循环，训练带共享核心的Matryoshka SAE，用梯度X激活测量特征对下一个标记损失的贡献，仅保留解释固定比例归因的最小子集，仅转移核心编码器权重向量。

Result: 在Gemma - 2 - 2B层12上经过七次蒸馏得到197个重复选择的特征核心，训练使用该核心提升了SAEBench指标。

Conclusion: DMSAEs能蒸馏出一致的潜在特征核心，且这些特征可跨稀疏级别转移。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) aim to disentangle model activations into monosemantic, human-interpretable features. In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型微调时任务的数据效率常未知，需多次标注和再训练，成本高，需预测数据效率的方法。

Method: 引入量化数据效率的指标，用低置信度样本的梯度余弦相似度，基于少量标注样本预测数据效率。

Result: 在不同数据效率任务上验证，数据效率预测总体误差8.6%，每个任务通常减少数百个不必要标注。

Conclusion: 提出的预测数据效率方法有效，可减少标注成本。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable zero-shot capability across many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is a common practice to improve their performance. However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task. Our experiment results and implementation code are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 本文分析扩散语言模型（DLMs）并行采样优势，证明其结合CoT可模拟并行采样算法，支持remasking或revision能优化空间复杂度并存在表达能力差距，倡导启用revision。

Motivation: 为DLMs通过并行生成token实现快速推理的优势提供严格理论基础。

Method: 形式化并行采样模型，证明DLMs结合CoT可模拟并行采样算法；证明支持remasking或revision能优化空间复杂度，建立表达能力差距。

Result: DLMs结合多项式长度CoT可使用最优数量的顺序步骤模拟并行采样算法；支持remasking或revision可使DLMs以最优空间复杂度模拟并行采样算法；有revision或remasking的DLMs表达能力更强。

Conclusion: 为DLMs作为高效并行采样器提供理论依据，倡导在DLMs中启用revision。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models for faster inference via parallel token generation. We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.

TL;DR: 提出ResponseRank方法解决从嘈杂强度信号中学习的挑战，在多任务中展现优势并提出新指标PDC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二元选择仅传达偏好方向，偏好强度对决策和模型泛化至关重要但难可靠测量，现有代理指标嘈杂且有混淆。

Method: 利用代理信号的相对差异对成对比较的响应按推断的偏好强度排序，仅在精心构建的层内进行局部信号比较。

Result: 在合成偏好学习、语言建模和强化学习控制任务中提高了样本效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ResponseRank能有效学习偏好强度，PDC可分离基数效用学习和序数准确性。

Abstract: Binary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.

Result: 发现均匀注意力和可训练注意力架构的学习表征在拓扑和几何上等效，实现相同算法。

Conclusion: 常见深度学习范式自然产生的模块化加法电路是相似的。

Abstract: The Clock and Pizza interpretations, associated with architectures differing in either uniform or learnable attention, were introduced to argue that different architectural designs can yield distinct circuits for modular addition. In this work, we show that this is not the case, and that both uniform attention and trainable attention architectures implement the same algorithm via topologically and geometrically equivalent representations. Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology. Based on this insight, we can statistically analyze the learned representations across hundreds of circuits to demonstrate the similarity between learned modular addition circuits that arise naturally from common deep learning paradigms.

Motivation: 现代transformers普遍作为单一思维系统训练，受‘智能源于多思维’启发，希望让模型从单一参数设置转变为能产生多样行为。

Method: 将归一化层中类似偏置的偏移量视为具有高斯变分近似的随机变量，引入贝叶斯后验近似；在序列级别冻结采样噪声；支持群体级决策。

Result: 在零样本生成、强化学习等实验中，B - Trans有效利用群体智慧，有更好语义多样性和任务性能。

Conclusion: B - Trans可有效利用群体智慧，在语义多样性和任务表现上优于确定性基线模型。

Abstract: Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.
  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.

Abstract: High-stakes decision making involves reasoning under uncertainty about the future. In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.

Conclusion: 提出的简约自适应阈值方法有效，研究结果为根据数据质量和分析优先级选择和调整分类算法提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Properties of ocular fixations and saccades are highly stochastic during many experimental tasks, and their statistics are often used as proxies for various aspects of cognition. Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive method based on a Markovian approximation of eye-gaze dynamics, using saccades and fixations as states such that the optimal threshold minimizes state transitions. Applying this to three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion), we evaluate the overall accuracy against a multi-threshold benchmark as well as robustness to noise. We find that a velocity threshold achieves the highest baseline accuracy (90-93\%) across both free-viewing and visual search tasks. However, velocity-based methods degrade rapidly under noise when thresholds remain fixed, with accuracy falling below 20% at high noise levels. Adaptive threshold optimization via K-ratio minimization substantially improves performance under noisy conditions for all algorithms. Adaptive dispersion thresholds demonstrate superior noise robustness, maintaining accuracy above 81% even at extreme noise levels (σ = 50 px), though a precision-recall trade-off emerges that favors fixation detection at the expense of saccade identification. In addition to demonstrating our parsimonious adaptive thresholding method, these findings provide practical guidance for selecting and tuning classification algorithms based on data quality and analytical priorities.

Motivation: 现有CMOEAs忽略约束间耦合，缺乏对约束几何角色的可解释性。

Method: 分析约束相互作用，提出DCF2D算法，周期性检测约束耦合，为相关约束生成辅助种群并确定合适搜索方向。

Result: 在七个CMOP基准套件和现实CMOPs上实验，DCF2D优于五个最先进的CMOEAs。

Conclusion: DCF2D算法能有效解决CMOPs中约束耦合问题，性能更优。

Abstract: Real-world Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problems (CMOPs) often contain multiple constraints, and understanding and utilizing the coupling between these constraints is crucial for solving CMOPs. However, existing Constrained Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (CMOEAs) typically ignore these couplings and treat all constraints as a single aggregate, which lacks interpretability regarding the specific geometric roles of constraints. To address this limitation, we first analyze how different constraints interact and show that the final Constrained Pareto Front (CPF) depends not only on the Pareto fronts of individual constraints but also on the boundaries of infeasible regions. This insight implies that CMOPs with different coupling types must be solved from different search directions. Accordingly, we propose a novel algorithm named Decoupling Constraint from Two Directions (DCF2D). This method periodically detects constraint couplings and spawns an auxiliary population for each relevant constraint with an appropriate search direction. Extensive experiments on seven challenging CMOP benchmark suites and on a collection of real-world CMOPs demonstrate that DCF2D outperforms five state-of-the-art CMOEAs, including existing decoupling-based methods.

Abstract: Simulation optimization (SO) is frequently challenged by noisy evaluations, high computational costs, and complex, multimodal search landscapes. This paper introduces Tabu-Enhanced Simulation Optimization (TESO), a novel metaheuristic framework integrating adaptive search with memory-based strategies. TESO leverages a short-term Tabu List to prevent cycling and encourage diversification, and a long-term Elite Memory to guide intensification by perturbing high-performing solutions. An aspiration criterion allows overriding tabu restrictions for exceptional candidates. This combination facilitates a dynamic balance between exploration and exploitation in stochastic environments. We demonstrate TESO's effectiveness and reliability using an queue optimization problem, showing improved performance compared to benchmarks and validating the contribution of its memory components.

Abstract: We present a genetic programming approach to automatically discover convergence acceleration methods for discrete ordinates solutions of neutron transport problems in slab geometry. Classical acceleration methods such as Aitken's delta-squared and Wynn epsilon assume specific convergence patterns and do not generalize well to the broad set of transport problems encountered in practice. We evolved mathematical formulas specifically tailored to SN convergence characteristics in this work. The discovered accelerator, featuring second differences and cross-product terms, achieved over 75 percent success rate in improving convergence compared to raw sequences - almost double that observed for classical techniques for the problem set considered. This work demonstrates the potential for discovering novel numerical methods in computational physics via genetic programming and attempts to honor Prof. Ganapol's legacy of advancing experimental mathematics applied to neutron transport.

Abstract: The hippocampus appears to implement two core but highly distinct functions in the brain: long term memory retrieval and planning and spatial navigation. Naively, these functions appear very different algorithmically. In this short note, we demonstrate that two powerful algorithms that have each independently been proposed to underlie the hippocampal operation for each function -- personalized page-rank for memory retrieval, and successor representations for planning and navigation, are in fact isomorphic and utilize the same underlying representation -- the stationary distribution of a random walk on a graph. We hypothesize that the core computational function of the hippocampus is to compute this representation on arbitrary input graphs.

Abstract: Heterogeneous-ISA processor designs have attracted considerable research interest. However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, "getting right" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration.

Conclusion: AgenticTCAD能实现端到端自动化设备设计与优化，且效率远高于人类专家使用商业工具。

Abstract: With the continued scaling of advanced technology nodes, the design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) paradigm has become increasingly critical, rendering efficient device design and optimization essential. In the domain of TCAD simulation, however, the scarcity of open-source resources hinders language models from generating valid TCAD code. To overcome this limitation, we construct an open-source TCAD dataset curated by experts and fine-tune a domain-specific model for TCAD code generation. Building on this foundation, we propose AgenticTCAD, a natural language - driven multi-agent framework that enables end-to-end automated device design and optimization. Validation on a 2 nm nanosheet FET (NS-FET) design shows that AgenticTCAD achieves the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS)-2024 device specifications within 4.2 hours, whereas human experts required 7.1 days with commercial tools.

TL;DR: 介绍本地临床编码的Hybrid - Code框架，评估显示其无幻觉代码，有验证率和覆盖率，结合多种方式保障可靠和隐私，冗余可靠性比纯模型性能更有价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于云的大语言模型用于临床编码自动化存在隐私风险和延迟瓶颈，不适合本地医疗部署，需新方法解决。

Method: 提出Hybrid - Code框架，包含尝试基于语言模型语义推理和备用关键字匹配的Coder，以及基于知识库和临床证据验证代码的Auditor。

Result: 在1000份MIMIC - III出院小结评估中，无幻觉代码，验证率24.47%，覆盖率34.11%，语言模型利用率超86%，Auditor过滤无效代码，拒绝率75.53%，保证患者数据不离开医院防火墙。

Conclusion: 混合架构确保可靠性和隐私保护，解决医疗AI应用关键障碍，冗余保证可靠性在医疗生产系统比纯模型性能更重要。

Abstract: Clinical coding automation using cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) poses privacy risks and latency bottlenecks, rendering them unsuitable for on-premise healthcare deployment. We introduce Hybrid-Code, a hybrid neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for local clinical coding that ensures production reliability through redundancy and verification. Our system comprises two agents: a Coder that attempts language model-based semantic reasoning using BioMistral-7B but falls back to deterministic keyword matching when model output is unreliable, ensuring pipeline completion; and an Auditor that verifies codes against a 257-code knowledge base and clinical evidence. Evaluating on 1,000 MIMIC-III discharge summaries, we demonstrate no hallucinated codes among accepted outputs within the knowledge base, 24.47% verification rate, and 34.11% coverage (95% CI: 31.2%--37.0%) with 86%+ language model utilization. The Auditor filtered invalid format codes and provided evidence-based quality control (75.53% rejection rate) while ensuring no patient data leaves the hospital firewall. The hybrid architecture -- combining language model semantic understanding (when successful), deterministic fallback (when the model fails), and symbolic verification (always active) -- ensures both reliability and privacy preservation, addressing critical barriers to AI adoption in healthcare. Our key finding is that reliability through redundancy is more valuable than pure model performance in production healthcare systems, where system failures are unacceptable.

TL;DR: 本文提出新的ATPG方法DEFT，将离散问题转化为连续优化任务，在工业基准测试中提升HTD故障检测率，是有前景的ATPG引擎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代IC复杂度使测试模式增长，多数模式针对难检测（HTD）故障，需新的ATPG算法提升HTD故障测试效果。

Method: 提出DEFT方法，将离散ATPG问题转化为连续优化任务，引入重参数化，集成自定义CUDA内核并应用梯度归一化。

Result: 在两个工业基准测试中，相同模式预算和可比运行时间下，平均提升HTD故障检测率21.1%和48.9%；支持部分赋值模式生成，减少19.3%的0/1位，多检测35%的故障。

Conclusion: DEFT是有前景且有效的ATPG引擎，可作为现有启发式方法的有价值补充。

Abstract: Modern IC complexity drives test pattern growth, with the majority of patterns targeting a small set of hard-to-detect (HTD) faults. This motivates new ATPG algorithms to improve test effectiveness specifically for HTD faults. This paper presents DEFT (Differentiable Automatic Test Pattern Generation), a new ATPG approach that reformulates the discrete ATPG problem as a continuous optimization task. DEFT introduces a mathematically grounded reparameterization that aligns the expected continuous objective with discrete fault-detection semantics, enabling reliable gradient-based pattern generation. To ensure scalability and stability on deep circuit graphs, DEFT integrates a custom CUDA kernel for efficient forward-backward propagation and applies gradient normalization to mitigate vanishing gradients. Compared to a leading commercial tool on two industrial benchmarks, DEFT improves HTD fault detection by 21.1% and 48.9% on average under the same pattern budget and comparable runtime. DEFT also supports practical ATPG settings such as partial assignment pattern generation, producing patterns with 19.3% fewer 0/1 bits while still detecting 35% more faults. These results indicate DEFT is a promising and effective ATPG engine, offering a valuable complement to existing heuristic.

Abstract: We present Mify-Coder, a 2.5B-parameter code model trained on 4.2T tokens using a compute-optimal strategy built on the Mify-2.5B foundation model. Mify-Coder achieves comparable accuracy and safety while significantly outperforming much larger baseline models on standard coding and function-calling benchmarks, demonstrating that compact models can match frontier-grade models in code generation and agent-driven workflows. Our training pipeline combines high-quality curated sources with synthetic data generated through agentically designed prompts, refined iteratively using enterprise-grade evaluation datasets. LLM-based quality filtering further enhances data density, enabling frugal yet effective training. Through disciplined exploration of CPT-SFT objectives, data mixtures, and sampling dynamics, we deliver frontier-grade code intelligence within a single continuous training trajectory. Empirical evidence shows that principled data and compute discipline allow smaller models to achieve competitive accuracy, efficiency, and safety compliance. Quantized variants of Mify-Coder enable deployment on standard desktop environments without requiring specialized hardware.

Conclusion: HyFair技术在检测算法偏差和生成解释方面表现良好，能有效解决现有个体公平概念的不足。

Abstract: Fairness in algorithmic decision-making is often framed in terms of individual fairness, which requires that similar individuals receive similar outcomes. A system violates individual fairness if there exists a pair of inputs differing only in protected attributes (such as race or gender) that lead to significantly different outcomes-for example, one favorable and the other unfavorable. While this notion highlights isolated instances of unfairness, it fails to capture broader patterns of systematic or clustered discrimination that may affect entire subgroups. We introduce and motivate the concept of discrimination clustering, a generalization of individual fairness violations. Rather than detecting single counterfactual disparities, we seek to uncover regions of the input space where small perturbations in protected features lead to k-significantly distinct clusters of outcomes. That is, for a given input, we identify a local neighborhood-differing only in protected attributes-whose members' outputs separate into many distinct clusters. These clusters reveal significant arbitrariness in treatment solely based on protected attributes that help expose patterns of algorithmic bias that elude pairwise fairness checks. We present HyFair, a hybrid technique that combines formal symbolic analysis (via SMT and MILP solvers) to certify individual fairness with randomized search to discover discriminatory clusters. This combination enables both formal guarantees-when no counterexamples exist-and the detection of severe violations that are computationally challenging for symbolic methods alone. Given a set of inputs exhibiting high k-unfairness, we introduce a novel explanation method to generate interpretable, decision-tree-style artifacts. Our experiments demonstrate that HyFair outperforms state-of-the-art fairness verification and local explanation methods.

Motivation: 汽车领域转向软件中心开发使嵌入式系统复杂度增加，缺乏连贯的系统测试方法，现实践依赖个人经验而非系统策略。

Method: 通过系统文献综述（SLR）结合行业经验和实践得出挑战和需求，用PRISMA评估技术和工具对汽车测试的适用性。

Result: 整理出支持技术/工具选择的目录，总结出九个生命周期内的挑战领域。

Conclusion: 提供了优先级标准目录以推荐模型规划、工具链等改进方向。

Abstract: The automotive domain is shifting to software-centric development to meet regulation, market pressure, and feature velocity. This shift increases embedded systems' complexity and strains testing capacity. Despite relevant standards, a coherent system-testing methodology that spans heterogeneous, legacy-constrained toolchains remains elusive, and practice often depends on individual expertise rather than a systematic strategy. We derive challenges and requirements from a systematic literature review (SLR), complemented by industry experience and practice. We map them to test case specification techniques and testing tools, evaluating their suitability for automotive testing using PRISMA. Our contribution is a curated catalog that supports technique/tool selection and can inform future testing frameworks and improvements. We synthesize nine recurring challenge areas across the life cycle, such as requirements quality and traceability, variability management, and toolchain fragmentation. We then provide a prioritized criteria catalog that recommends model-based planning, interoperable and traceable toolchains, requirements uplift, pragmatic automation and virtualization, targeted AI and formal methods, actionable metrics, and lightweight organizational practices.

Abstract: Context: Fairness in systems has emerged as a critical concern in software engineering, garnering increasing attention as the field has advanced in recent years. While several guidelines have been proposed to address fairness, achieving a comprehensive understanding of research solutions for ensuring fairness in software systems remains challenging. Objectives: This paper presents a systematic literature mapping to explore and categorize current advancements in fairness solutions within software engineering, focusing on three key dimensions: research trends, research focus, and viability in industrial contexts. Methods: We develop a classification framework to organize research on software fairness from a fresh perspective, applying it to 95 selected studies and analyzing their potential for industrial adoption. Results: Our findings reveal that software fairness research is expanding, yet it remains heavily focused on methods and algorithms. It primarily focuses on post-processing and group fairness, with less emphasis on early-stage interventions, individual fairness metrics, and understanding bias root causes. Additionally fairness research remains largely academic, with limited industry collaboration and low to medium Technology Readiness Level (TRL), indicating that industrial transferability remains distant. Conclusion: Our results underscore the need to incorporate fairness considerations across all stages of the software development life-cycle and to foster greater collaboration between academia and industry. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the field, offering a foundation to guide future research and practical applications of fairness in software systems.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from code generators into collaborative partners for software engineers, our methods for evaluation are lagging. Current benchmarks, focused on code correctness, fail to capture the nuanced, interactive behaviors essential for successful human-AI partnership. To bridge this evaluation gap, this paper makes two core contributions. First, we present a foundational taxonomy of desirable agent behaviors for enterprise software engineering, derived from an analysis of 91 sets of user-defined agent rules. This taxonomy defines four key expectations of agent behavior: Adhere to Standards and Processes, Ensure Code Quality and Reliability, Solving Problems Effectively, and Collaborating with the User.
  Second, recognizing that these expectations are not static, we introduce the Context-Adaptive Behavior (CAB) Framework. This emerging framework reveals how behavioral expectations shift along two empirically-derived axes: the Time Horizon (from immediate needs to future ideals), established through interviews with 15 expert engineers, and the Type of Work (from enterprise production to rapid prototyping, for example), identified through a prompt analysis of a prototyping agent. Together, these contributions offer a human-centered foundation for designing and evaluating the next generation of AI agents, moving the field's focus from the correctness of generated code toward the dynamics of true collaborative intelligence.

Result: 传统模型F1值虚高，在关键缺陷转换案例上失败；新框架在不同进化子集上表现更平衡，对缺陷引入的敏感性显著提高。

Conclusion: 当前软件缺陷预测评估实践存在根本缺陷，实际缺陷预测需要变更感知推理。

Abstract: Much of the reported progress in file-level software defect prediction (SDP) is, in reality, nothing but an illusion of accuracy. Over the last decades, machine learning and deep learning models have reported increasing performance across software versions. However, since most files persist across releases and retain their defect labels, standard evaluation rewards label-persistence bias rather than reasoning about code changes. To address this issue, we reformulate SDP as a change-aware prediction task, in which models reason over code changes of a file within successive project versions, rather than relying on static file snapshots. Building on this formulation, we propose an LLM-driven, change-aware, multi-agent debate framework. Our experiments on multiple PROMISE projects show that traditional models achieve inflated F1, while failing on rare but critical defect-transition cases. In contrast, our change-aware reasoning and multi-agent debate framework yields more balanced performance across evolution subsets and significantly improves sensitivity to defect introductions. These results highlight fundamental flaws in current SDP evaluation practices and emphasize the need for change-aware reasoning in practical defect prediction. The source code is publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new paradigms in software development, including vibe coding, AI-assisted coding, and agentic coding, fundamentally reshaping how software is designed, implemented, and maintained. Prior research has primarily examined AI-based coding at the individual level or in educational settings, leaving industrial practitioners' perspectives underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how LLM coding tools are used in professional practice, the associated concerns and risks, and the resulting transformations in development workflows, with particular attention to implications for computing education. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 57 curated YouTube videos published between late 2024 and 2025, capturing reflections and experiences shared by practitioners. Following a filtering and quality assessment process, the selected sources were analyzed to compare LLM-based and traditional programming, identify emerging risks, and characterize evolving workflows. Our findings reveal definitions of AI-based coding practices, notable productivity gains, and lowered barriers to entry. Practitioners also report a shift in development bottlenecks toward code review and concerns regarding code quality, maintainability, security vulnerabilities, ethical issues, erosion of foundational problem-solving skills, and insufficient preparation of entry-level engineers. Building on these insights, we discuss implications for computer science and software engineering education and argue for curricular shifts toward problem-solving, architectural thinking, code review, and early project-based learning that integrates LLM tools. This study offers an industry-grounded perspective on AI-based coding and provides guidance for aligning educational practices with rapidly evolving professional realities.

The method has been tested for event-driven temporal requirements.

Conclusion: CoHalLo在代码幻觉的行级定位上表现良好，有效提升了AI生成代码可靠性。

Abstract: The localization of code hallucinations aims to identify specific lines of code containing hallucinations, helping developers to improve the reliability of AI-generated code more efficiently. Although recent studies have adopted several methods to detect code hallucination, most of these approaches remain limited to coarse-grained detection and lack specialized techniques for fine-grained hallucination localization. This study introduces a novel method, called CoHalLo, which achieves line-level code hallucination localization by probing the hidden-layer vectors from hallucination detection models. CoHalLo uncovers the key syntactic information driving the model's hallucination judgments and locates the hallucinating code lines accordingly. Specifically, we first fine-tune the hallucination detection model on manually annotated datasets to ensure that it learns features pertinent to code syntactic information. Subsequently, we designed a probe network that projects high-dimensional latent vectors onto a low-dimensional syntactic subspace, generating vector tuples and reconstructing the predicted abstract syntax tree (P-AST). By comparing P-AST with the original abstract syntax tree (O-AST) extracted from the input AI-generated code, we identify the key syntactic structures associated with hallucinations. This information is then used to pinpoint hallucinated code lines. To evaluate CoHalLo's performance, we manually collected a dataset of code hallucinations. The experimental results show that CoHalLo achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 0.4253, Top-3 accuracy of 0.6149, Top-5 accuracy of 0.7356, Top-10 accuracy of 0.8333, IFA of 5.73, Recall@1% Effort of 0.052721, and Effort@20% Recall of 0.155269, which outperforms the baseline methods.

Abstract: The software development workplace poses numerous technical and collaborative accessibility challenges for blind and low vision software professionals (BLVSPs). Though Generative AI (GenAI) is increasingly adopted within the software development industry and has been a rapidly growing topic of interest in research, to date, the unique perspectives of BLVSPs have yet to be consulted. We report on a qualitative study involving 39 semi-structured interviews with BLVSPs about what the introduction of GenAI has meant for their work. We found that BLVSPs used GenAI for many software development tasks, resulting in benefits such as increased productivity and accessibility. However, significant costs were also accompanied by GenAI use as they were more vulnerable to hallucinations than their sighted colleagues. Sometimes, organizational policies prevented use. Based on our findings, we discuss the higher-risks and higher-returns that BLVSPs had to carefully weigh when deciding whether and when to use GenAI tools for work.

Conclusion: 该技术在一定条件下，对代码训练的探针显示出对自然语言错误的泛化迹象。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) can generate complicated source code from natural language prompts. However, LLMs can generate output that deviates from what the user wants, requiring supervision and editing. To support this process, we offer techniques to localize where generations might be misaligned from user intent. We first create a dataset of "Minimal Intent Aligning Patches" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger. We discuss the generalizability of the techniques, and the connections to AI oversight and control, finding a probe trained only on code shows some signs of generalizing to natural language errors if new probability scaling is allowed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, largely driven by the availability of high-quality code datasets for effective training. To further improve data quality, numerous training data optimization techniques have been proposed; however, their overall effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study, examining five widely-used training data optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations for LLM-based code generation across three benchmarks and four LLMs. Our results show that data synthesis is the most effective technique for improving functional correctness and reducing code smells, although it performs relatively worse on code maintainability compared to data refactoring, cleaning, and selection. Regarding combinations, we find that most combinations do not further improve functional correctness but can effectively enhance code quality (code smells and maintainability). Among all combinations, data synthesis combined with data refactoring achieves the strongest overall performance. Furthermore, our fine-grained analysis reinforces these findings and provides deeper insights into how individual techniques and their combinations influence code generation effectiveness. Overall, this work represents a first step toward a systematic understanding of training data optimization and combination strategies, offering practical guidance for future research and deployment in LLM-based code generation.

Conclusion: Preguss框架在自动化生成和细化形式化规范方面效果显著，能有效提高形式验证的自动化程度和效率。

Abstract: Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort.

Abstract: LLM-based software engineering is influencing modern software development. In addition to correctness, prior studies have also examined the performance of software artifacts generated by AI agents. However, it is unclear how exactly the agentic AI systems address performance concerns in practice. In this paper, we present an empirical study of performance-related pull requests generated by AI agents. Using LLM-assisted detection and BERTopic-based topic modeling, we identified 52 performance-related topics grouped into 10 higher-level categories. Our results show that AI agents apply performance optimizations across diverse layers of the software stack and that the type of optimization significantly affects pull request acceptance rates and review times. We also found that performance optimization by AI agents primarily occurs during the development phase, with less focus on the maintenance phase. Our findings provide empirical evidence that can support the evaluation and improvement of agentic AI systems with respect to their performance optimization behaviors and review outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出DynaFix方法，利用执行级动态信息迭代修复程序，在基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的自动程序修复方法存在局限，未充分利用运行时行为和细粒度执行信息，难以进行多步推理和复杂错误修复。

Method: 提出DynaFix方法，在每次修复轮次中捕获执行级动态信息，转化为结构化提示引导大语言模型生成候选补丁，若补丁验证失败则重新执行程序收集新信息。

Result: 在Defects4J v1.2和v2.0基准测试中，修复186个单函数错误，比现有方法多修复38个，最多35次尝试可获得正确补丁，减少70%的补丁搜索空间。

Conclusion: DynaFix在修复复杂错误方面有效且高效。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate correct patches for buggy programs. Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.
  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.

Abstract: As Software Engineering enters its new era (SE 3.0), AI coding agents increasingly automate software development workflows. However, it remains unclear how exactly these agents recognize and address software energy concerns-an issue growing in importance due to large-scale data centers, energy-hungry language models, and battery-constrained devices. In this paper, we examined the energy awareness of agent-authored pull requests (PRs) using a publicly available dataset. We identified 216 energy-explicit PRs and conducted a thematic analysis, deriving a taxonomy of energy-aware work. Our further analysis of the applied optimization techniques shows that most align with established research recommendations. Although building and running these agents is highly energy intensive, encouragingly, the results indicate that they exhibit energy awareness when generating software artifacts. However, optimization-related PRs are accepted less frequently than others, largely due to their negative impact on maintainability.

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is essential for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of hybrid quantum-classical systems, yet empirical evidence on how bugs emerge and affect quality in real-world quantum projects remains limited. This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software defects across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most defect-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with defect densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity defects cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more defects and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected defect incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software defects and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE.

Motivation: 测量函数相似性检测漏洞时，与漏洞无关的语句产生的噪声干扰会影响性能，现有工作难以消除目标中的噪声。

Method: 从漏洞查询和目标中提取特征切片表示（潜在）漏洞逻辑的语义特征，以端到端的方式利用漏洞代码的先验知识指导目标切片，确定切片标准，对所有特征切片进行嵌入并基于向量相似性进行比较，审计漏洞候选来确认目标中的未知漏洞。

Result: MATUS在真实世界项目的漏洞检测中具有优势且效率可接受，在Linux内核中发现31个未知漏洞，均得到内核开发者确认，11个被分配CVE。

Conclusion: MATUS在减轻目标噪声以实现精确的漏洞检测方面是有效的。

Abstract: Measuring the function similarity to detect bugs is effective, but the statements unrelated to the bugs can impede the performance due to the noise interference. Suppressing the noise interference in existing works does not manage the tough job, i.e., eliminating the noise in the targets. In this paper, we propose MATUS to mitigate the target noise for precise bug detection based on similarity measurement. Feature slices are extracted from both the buggy query and the targets to represent the semantic feature of (potential) bug logics. In particular, MATUS guides the target slicing with the prior knowledge from the buggy code, in an end-to-end way to pinpoint the slicing criterion in the targets. All feature slices are embedded and compared based on the vector similarity. Buggy candidates are audited to confirm unknown bugs in the targets. Experiments show that MATUS holds advantages in bug detection for real-world projects with acceptable efficiency. In total, MATUS has spotted 31 unknown bugs in the Linux kernel. All of them have been confirmed by the kernel developers, and 11 have been assigned CVEs.

Abstract: The railway ticketing system is one of the most important public service infrastructure. In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the "add passenger" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency.

Result: 构建的可观测信号在特定市场制度下有经济相关性，但在制度转换时表现下降。

Conclusion: 说明了非平稳市场中因果信号设计的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting in financial time series under strict causal constraints, treating the market as a non-stationary stochastic system in which any predictive observable must be computable online from information available up to the decision time. Rather than proposing a machine-learning predictor or a direct price-forecast model, we focus on \emph{constructing} an interpretable causal signal from heterogeneous micro-features that encode complementary aspects of the dynamics (momentum, volume pressure, trend acceleration, and volatility-normalized price location). The construction combines (i) causal centering, (ii) linear aggregation into a composite observable, (iii) causal stabilization via a one-dimensional Kalman filter, and (iv) an adaptive ``forward-like'' operator that mixes the composite signal with a smoothed causal derivative term. The resulting observable is mapped into a transparent decision functional and evaluated through realized cumulative returns and turnover. An application to high-frequency EURUSDT (1-minute) illustrates that causally constructed observables can exhibit substantial economic relevance in specific regimes, while degrading under subsequent regime shifts, highlighting both the potential and the limitations of causal signal design in non-stationary markets.

Abstract: This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) from leading providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI) can be applied to quantitative sector-based portfolio construction. We use LLMs to identify investable universes of stocks within S&P 500 sector indices and evaluate how their selections perform when combined with classical portfolio optimization methods. Each model was prompted to select and weight 20 stocks per sector, and the resulting portfolios were compared with their respective sector indices across two distinct out-of-sample periods: a stable market phase (January-March 2025) and a volatile phase (April-June 2025).
  Our results reveal a strong temporal dependence in LLM portfolio performance. During stable market conditions, LLM-weighted portfolios frequently outperformed sector indices on both cumulative return and risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio) measures. However, during the volatile period, many LLM portfolios underperformed, suggesting that current models may struggle to adapt to regime shifts or high-volatility environments underrepresented in their training data. Importantly, when LLM-based stock selection is combined with traditional optimization techniques, portfolio outcomes improve in both performance and consistency.
  This study contributes one of the first multi-model, cross-provider evaluations of generative AI algorithms in investment management. It highlights that while LLMs can effectively complement quantitative finance by enhancing stock selection and interpretability, their reliability remains market-dependent. The findings underscore the potential of hybrid AI-quantitative frameworks, integrating LLM reasoning with established optimization techniques, to produce more robust and adaptive investment strategies.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和算法有效，在风险敏感强化学习和实际应用（如期权对冲）中有优势。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) that incorporates robustness against transition uncertainty. We define two distinct yet coupled risk measures: an inner risk measure addressing state and cost randomness and an outer risk measure capturing transition dynamics uncertainty. Our framework unifies and generalizes most existing RL frameworks by permitting general coherent risk measures for both inner and outer risk measures. Within this framework, we construct a risk-sensitive robust Markov decision process (RSRMDP), derive its Bellman equation, and provide error analysis under a given posterior distribution. We further develop a Bayesian Dynamic Programming (Bayesian DP) algorithm that alternates between posterior updates and value iteration. The approach employs an estimator for the risk-based Bellman operator that combines Monte Carlo sampling with convex optimization, for which we prove strong consistency guarantees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges to a near-optimal policy in the training environment and analyze both the sample complexity and the computational complexity under the Dirichlet posterior and CVaR. Finally, we validate our approach through two numerical experiments. The results exhibit excellent convergence properties while providing intuitive demonstrations of its advantages in both risk-sensitivity and robustness. Empirically, we further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm through an application on option hedging.

Motivation: 机器学习在保险定价中加剧了不同公平性标准间的权衡问题，现有公平感知模型受单目标优化限制，无法全面处理准确性和多种公平性间的冲突。

Method: 提出通过非支配排序遗传算法II（NSGA-II）联合优化准确性、群体公平性、个体公平性和反事实公平性四个标准的多目标优化框架，并使用特定选择机制提取保费。

Result: XGBoost在准确性上优于GLM但扩大公平差异；Orthogonal模型群体公平性出色，Synthetic Control在个体和反事实公平性上领先，本方法能实现平衡。

Conclusion: 本方法相比单模型方法能更好地在保险定价中平衡准确性和多种公平性。

Abstract: Machine learning improves predictive accuracy in insurance pricing but exacerbates trade-offs between competing fairness criteria across different discrimination measures, challenging regulators and insurers to reconcile profitability with equitable outcomes. While existing fairness-aware models offer partial solutions under GLM and XGBoost estimation methods, they remain constrained by single-objective optimization, failing to holistically navigate a conflicting landscape of accuracy, group fairness, individual fairness, and counterfactual fairness. To address this, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework that jointly optimizes all four criteria via the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), generating a diverse Pareto front of trade-off solutions. We use a specific selection mechanism to extract a premium on this front. Our results show that XGBoost outperforms GLM in accuracy but amplifies fairness disparities; the Orthogonal model excels in group fairness, while Synthetic Control leads in individual and counterfactual fairness. Our method consistently achieves a balanced compromise, outperforming single-model approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FQE作为强化学习离策略评估的核心方法，通常需要Bellman完备性，但扩大假设类会使完备性变差，要解决此要求带来的挑战。

Method: 提出用平稳密度比估计重新加权每个回归步骤，使FQE与Bellman算子收缩的规范一致。

Result: 在无可实现性或Bellman完备性的情况下实现强评估保证，避免标准FQE在此情况下的几何误差爆炸，且保持基于回归评估的实用性。

Conclusion: 这种修复方法能有效解决FQE方法在实际应用中对Bellman完备性的依赖问题。

Abstract: Fitted Q-evaluation (FQE) is a central method for off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, but it generally requires Bellman completeness: that the hypothesis class is closed under the evaluation Bellman operator. This requirement is challenging because enlarging the hypothesis class can worsen completeness. We show that the need for this assumption stems from a fundamental norm mismatch: the Bellman operator is gamma-contractive under the stationary distribution of the target policy, whereas FQE minimizes Bellman error under the behavior distribution. We propose a simple fix: reweight each regression step using an estimate of the stationary density ratio, thereby aligning FQE with the norm in which the Bellman operator contracts. This enables strong evaluation guarantees in the absence of realizability or Bellman completeness, avoiding the geometric error blow-up of standard FQE in this setting while maintaining the practicality of regression-based evaluation.

Abstract: Denoising and score estimation have long been known to be linked via the classical Tweedie's formula. In this work, we first extend the latter to a wider range of distributions often called "energy models" and denoted elliptical distributions in this work. Next, we examine an alternative view: we consider the denoising posterior $P(X|Y)$ as the optimizer of the energy score (a scoring rule) and derive a fundamental identity that connects the (path-) derivative of a (possibly) non-Euclidean energy score to the score of the noisy marginal. This identity can be seen as an analog of Tweedie's identity for the energy score, and allows for several interesting applications; for example, score estimation, noise distribution parameter estimation, as well as using energy score models in the context of "traditional" diffusion model samplers with a wider array of noising distributions.

Conclusion: stationary - reweighted soft FQI可改善性能，逐渐降低softmax温度可能恢复全局收敛，该方法能在一定条件下扩展到hardmax极限。

Abstract: Fitted Q-iteration (FQI) and its entropy-regularized variant, soft FQI, are central tools for value-based model-free offline reinforcement learning, but can behave poorly under function approximation and distribution shift. In the entropy-regularized setting, we show that the soft Bellman operator is locally contractive in the stationary norm of the soft-optimal policy, rather than in the behavior norm used by standard FQI. This geometric mismatch explains the instability of soft Q-iteration with function approximation in the absence of Bellman completeness. To restore contraction, we introduce stationary-reweighted soft FQI, which reweights each regression update using the stationary distribution of the current policy. We prove local linear convergence under function approximation with geometrically damped weight-estimation errors, assuming approximate realizability. Our analysis further suggests that global convergence may be recovered by gradually reducing the softmax temperature, and that this continuation approach can extend to the hardmax limit under a mild margin condition.

### [194] [Implicit geometric regularization in flow matching via density weighted Stein operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23956)
*Shinto Eguchi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出γ - Flow Matching (γ - FM)，一种密度加权的Flow Matching变体，可改善高维数据向量场平滑度和采样效率，且对异常值有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Flow Matching在高维空间对整个环境空间进行无加权L²回归，导致大部分积分区域是低密度“空洞”区域，目标速度场混乱或定义不明确，存在效率问题。

Method: 提出γ - FM，引入动态密度加权策略，直接从训练粒子估计目标密度，动态降低空洞区域的回归损失，且不影响FM无模拟的特性。

Result: 理论上，γ - FM最小化了具有γ - Stein度量的统计流形上的传输成本；谱分析表明其几何结构能有效抑制空洞区域的高频振荡。实证上，显著提高了高维潜在数据集的向量场平滑度和采样效率，对异常值具有内在鲁棒性。

Conclusion: γ - FM是一种有效的密度加权Flow Matching变体，在高维数据处理中有较好表现。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for continuous normalizing flows, yet standard FM implicitly performs an unweighted $L^2$ regression over the entire ambient space. In high dimensions, this leads to a fundamental inefficiency: the vast majority of the integration domain consists of low-density ``void'' regions where the target velocity fields are often chaotic or ill-defined. In this paper, we propose {$γ$-Flow Matching ($γ$-FM)}, a density-weighted variant that aligns the regression geometry with the underlying probability flow. While density weighting is desirable, naive implementations would require evaluating the intractable target density. We circumvent this by introducing a Dynamic Density-Weighting strategy that estimates the \emph{target} density directly from training particles. This approach allows us to dynamically downweight the regression loss in void regions without compromising the simulation-free nature of FM. Theoretically, we establish that $γ$-FM minimizes the transport cost on a statistical manifold endowed with the $γ$-Stein metric. Spectral analysis further suggests that this geometry induces an implicit Sobolev regularization, effectively damping high-frequency oscillations in void regions. Empirically, $γ$-FM significantly improves vector field smoothness and sampling efficiency on high-dimensional latent datasets, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to outliers.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a class of stochastic interpolation neural network operators (SINNOs) with random coefficients activated by sigmoidal functions. We establish their boundedness, interpolation accuracy, and approximation capabilities in the mean square sense, in probability, as well as path-wise within the space of second-order stochastic (random) processes \( L^2(Ω, \mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}) \). Additionally, we provide quantitative error estimates using the modulus of continuity of the processes. These results highlight the effectiveness of SINNOs for approximating stochastic processes with potential applications in COVID-19 case prediction.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and its variants approximate the likelihood of an entire dataset, via random (and typically much smaller) subsets, in the setting of Bayesian sampling. Due to the (often substantial) improvement of the computational efficiency, they have been widely used in large-scale machine learning applications. It has been demonstrated that the so-called covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin (CCAdL) thermostat, which incorporates an additional term involving the covariance matrix of the noisy force, outperforms popular alternative methods. A moving average is used in CCAdL to estimate the covariance matrix of the noisy force, in which case the covariance matrix will converge to a constant matrix in long-time limit. Moreover, it appears in our numerical experiments that the use of a moving average could reduce the stability of the numerical integrators, thereby limiting the largest usable stepsize. In this article, we propose a modified CCAdL (i.e., mCCAdL) thermostat that uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential to numerically approximate the exact solution to the subsystem involving the additional term proposed in CCAdL. We also propose a symmetric splitting method for mCCAdL, instead of an Euler-type discretisation used in the original CCAdL thermostat. We demonstrate in our numerical experiments that the newly proposed mCCAdL thermostat achieves a substantial improvement in the numerical stability over the original CCAdL thermostat, while significantly outperforming popular alternative stochastic gradient methods in terms of the numerical accuracy for large-scale machine learning applications.

Conclusion: 所提拓扑空间图粗化方法能在减小图规模同时有效保留拓扑特征。

Abstract: Spatial graphs are particular graphs for which the nodes are localized in space (e.g., public transport network, molecules, branching biological structures). In this work, we consider the problem of spatial graph reduction, that aims to find a smaller spatial graph (i.e., with less nodes) with the same overall structure as the initial one. In this context, performing the graph reduction while preserving the main topological features of the initial graph is particularly relevant, due to the additional spatial information. Thus, we propose a topological spatial graph coarsening approach based on a new framework that finds a trade-off between the graph reduction and the preservation of the topological characteristics. The coarsening is realized by collapsing short edges. In order to capture the topological information required to calibrate the reduction level, we adapt the construction of classical topological descriptors made for point clouds (the so-called persistent diagrams) to spatial graphs. This construction relies on the introduction of a new filtration called triangle-aware graph filtration. Our coarsening approach is parameter-free and we prove that it is equivariant under rotations, translations and scaling of the initial spatial graph. We evaluate the performances of our method on synthetic and real spatial graphs, and show that it significantly reduces the graph sizes while preserving the relevant topological information.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI系统在现实应用中日益广泛，对模型行为进行多维度监管至关重要。

Method: 形式化定义多风险约束问题，引入MULTIRISK - BASE和MULTIRISK两个动态规划算法，采用复杂迭代论证方法进行分析。

Result: 实验表明算法能将每个个体风险控制在接近目标的水平。

Conclusion: MULTIRISK算法在温和假设下能对所有约束风险实现近乎严格的控制。

Abstract: As generative AI systems are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, regulating multiple dimensions of model behavior has become essential. We focus on test-time filtering: a lightweight mechanism for behavior control that compares performance scores to estimated thresholds, and modifies outputs when these bounds are violated. We formalize the problem of enforcing multiple risk constraints with user-defined priorities, and introduce two efficient dynamic programming algorithms that leverage this sequential structure. The first, MULTIRISK-BASE, provides a direct finite-sample procedure for selecting thresholds, while the second, MULTIRISK, leverages data exchangeability to guarantee simultaneous control of the risks. Under mild assumptions, we show that MULTIRISK achieves nearly tight control of all constraint risks. The analysis requires an intricate iterative argument, upper bounding the risks by introducing several forms of intermediate symmetrized risk functions, and carefully lower bounding the risks by recursively counting jumps in symmetrized risk functions between appropriate risk levels. We evaluate our framework on a three-constraint Large Language Model alignment task using the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, where the goal is to maximize helpfulness subject to multiple safety constraints, and where scores are generated by a Large Language Model judge and a perplexity filter. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can control each individual risk at close to the target level.

Conclusion: 在高维稀疏 MDPs 有单策略集中性覆盖和数据损坏的情况下，学习近最优策略是可行的，传统方法可能失效时该算法有效。

Abstract: We investigate robustness to strong data corruption in offline sparse reinforcement learning (RL). In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.

Result: 在标准图像生成基准上，相同NFE预算下提高样本质量，与高阶采样器竞争甚至超越。

Conclusion: DPM评估点放置为加速扩散采样提供额外独立设计角度。

Abstract: Higher-order ODE solvers have become a standard tool for accelerating diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) sampling, motivating the widespread view that first-order methods are inherently slower and that increasing discretization order is the primary path to faster generation. This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime.
  We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.

Conclusion: 扩展了NMF对更广泛计数数据的适用性。

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used as a feature extraction technique for matrices with non-negative entries, such as image data, purchase histories, and other types of count data. In NMF, a non-negative matrix is decomposed into the product of two non-negative matrices, and the approximation accuracy is evaluated by a loss function. If the Kullback-Leibler divergence is chosen as the loss function, the estimation coincides with maximum likelihood under the assumption that the data entries are distributed according to a Poisson distribution. To address overdispersion, negative binomial matrix factorization has recently been proposed as an extension of the Poisson-based model. However, the negative binomial distribution often generates an excessive number of zeros, which limits its expressive capacity. In this study, we propose a non-negative matrix factorization based on the generalized Poisson distribution, which can flexibly accommodate overdispersion, and we introduce a maximum likelihood approach for parameter estimation. This methodology provides a more versatile framework than existing models, thereby extending the applicability of NMF to a broader class of count data.

Abstract: This paper studies the policy mirror descent (PMD) method, which is a general policy optimization framework in reinforcement learning and can cover a wide range of policy gradient methods by specifying difference mirror maps. Existing sample complexity analysis for policy mirror descent either focuses on the generative sampling model, or the Markovian sampling model but with the action values being explicitly approximated to certain pre-specified accuracy. In contrast, we consider the sample complexity of policy mirror descent with temporal difference (TD) learning under the Markovian sampling model. Two algorithms called Expected TD-PMD and Approximate TD-PMD have been presented, which are off-policy and mixed policy algorithms respectively. Under a small enough constant policy update step size, the $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (a logarithm factor about $\varepsilon$ is hidden in $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$) sample complexity can be established for them to achieve average-time $\varepsilon$-optimality. The sample complexity is further improved to $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (without the hidden logarithm factor) to achieve the last-iterate $\varepsilon$-optimality based on adaptive policy update step sizes.

Conclusion: MP - Jacobi框架有效解决有限和非线性规划问题，在收敛性、复杂度和性能上有优势。

Abstract: We study finite-sum nonlinear programs whose decision variables interact locally according to a graph or hypergraph. We propose MP-Jacobi (Message Passing-Jacobi), a graph-compliant decentralized framework that couples min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters. At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving a cluster subproblem whose objective decomposes into (i) an intra-cluster term evaluated by a single min-sum sweep on the cluster tree (cost-to-go messages) and (ii) inter-cluster couplings handled via a Jacobi correction using neighbors' latest iterates. This design uses only single-hop communication and yields a convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.
  For strongly convex objectives we establish global linear convergence and explicit rates that quantify how curvature, coupling strength, and the chosen partition affect scalability and provide guidance for clustering. To mitigate the computation and communication cost of exact message updates, we develop graph-compliant surrogates that preserve convergence while reducing per-iteration complexity. We further extend MP-Jacobi to hypergraphs; in heavily overlapping regimes, a surrogate-based hyperedge-splitting scheme restores finite-time intra-cluster message updates and maintains convergence. Experiments validate the theory and show consistent improvements over decentralized gradient baselines.

Abstract: We consider an agent who has access to a financial market, including derivative contracts, who looks to maximise her utility. Whilst the agent looks to maximise utility over one probability measure, or class of probability measures, she must also ensure that the mark-to-market value of her portfolio remains above a given threshold. When the mark-to-market value is based on a more pessimistic valuation method, such as model-independent bounds, we recover a novel optimisation problem for the agent where the agents investment problem must satisfy a pathwise constraint.
  For complete markets, the expression of the optimal terminal wealth is given, using the max-plus decomposition for supermartingales. Moreover, for the Black-Scholes-Merton model the explicit form of the process involved in such decomposition is obtained, and we are able to investigate numerically optimal portfolios in the presence of options which are mispriced according to the agent's beliefs.

Abstract: Optical-readout Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) produce megapixel-scale images whose fine-grained topological information is essential for rare-event searches, but whose size challenges real-time data selection. We present an unsupervised, reconstruction-based anomaly-detection strategy for fast Region-of-Interest (ROI) extraction that operates directly on minimally processed camera frames. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images learns the detector noise morphology without labels, simulation, or fine-grained calibration. Applied to standard data-taking frames, localized reconstruction residuals identify particle-induced structures, from which compact ROIs are extracted via thresholding and spatial clustering. Using real data from the CYGNO optical TPC prototype, we compare two pedestal-trained autoencoder configurations that differ only in their training objective, enabling a controlled study of its impact. The best configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with an inference time of approximately 25 ms per frame on a consumer GPU. The results demonstrate that careful design of the training objective is critical for effective reconstruction-based anomaly detection and that pedestal-trained autoencoders provide a transparent and detector-agnostic baseline for online data reduction in optical TPCs.

Abstract: In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.

Abstract: Neural Network Field Theories (NN-FTs) can realize global conformal symmetries via embedding space architectures. These models describe Generalized Free Fields (GFFs) in the infinite width limit. However, they typically lack a local stress-energy tensor satisfying conformal Ward identities. This presents an obstruction to realizing infinite-dimensional, local conformal symmetry typifying 2d Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). We present the first construction of an NN-FT that encodes the full Virasoro symmetry of a 2d CFT. We formulate a neural free boson theory with a local stress tensor $T(z)$ by properly choosing the architecture and prior distribution of network parameters. We verify the analytical results through numerical simulation; computing the central charge and the scaling dimensions of vertex operators. We then construct an NN realization of a Majorana Fermion and an $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ scalar multiplet, which then enables an extension of the formalism to include super-Virasoro symmetry. Finally, we extend the framework by constructing boundary NN-FTs that preserve (super-)conformal symmetry via the method of images.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮廓系数在网络社区检测中的性能缺乏足够表征，需要评估其在不同网络中的表现。

Method: 对无权重、有权重和完全连接网络进行综合评估，研究网络规模、分离强度和社区规模不平衡对轮廓系数性能的影响，同时进行模拟研究，并将评估扩展到真实的航空公司可达性网络。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在网络聚类中应用轮廓系数提供了经验指导，明确了其最可靠的使用条件。

Abstract: Selecting the number of communities is a fundamental challenge in network clustering. The silhouette score offers an intuitive, model-free criterion that balances within-cluster cohesion and between-cluster separation. Albeit its widespread use in clustering analysis, its performance in network-based community detection remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of the silhouette score across unweighted, weighted, and fully connected networks, examining how network size, separation strength, and community size imbalance influence its performance. Simulation studies show that the silhouette score accurately identifies the true number of communities when clusters are well separated and balanced, but it tends to underestimate under strong imbalance or weak separation and to overestimate in sparse networks. Extending the evaluation to a real airline reachability network, we demonstrate that the silhouette-based clustering can recover geographically interpretable and market-oriented clusters. These findings provide empirical guidance for applying the silhouette score in network clustering and clarify the conditions under which its use is most reliable.

TL;DR: 提出Community - IM++框架解决影响最大化问题，实验显示其效率高且表现优，适用于大规模应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于社区的影响最大化方法假设社区间独立，忽略社区间影响，在真实网络中有效性降低。

Method: 引入Community - IM++框架，通过基于社区扩散度的启发式方法和渐进预算策略建模跨社区扩散，分区网络、计算CDD、自适应分配种子。

Result: 在不同边权重模型的大型真实社交网络实验中，Community - IM++在运行时间低至贪心算法1/100时达到接近贪心算法的影响传播，且表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Community - IM++在大规模应用如病毒营销、虚假信息控制和公共卫生运动中具实用性。

Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM) seeks to identify a small set of seed nodes in a social network to maximize expected information spread under a diffusion model. While community-based approaches improve scalability by exploiting modular structure, they typically assume independence between communities, overlooking inter-community influence$\unicode{x2014}$a limitation that reduces effectiveness in real-world networks. We introduce Community-IM++, a scalable framework that explicitly models cross-community diffusion through a principled heuristic based on community-based diffusion degree (CDD) and a progressive budgeting strategy. The algorithm partitions the network, computes CDD to prioritize bridging nodes, and allocates seeds adaptively across communities using lazy evaluation to minimize redundant computations. Experiments on large real-world social networks under different edge weight models show that Community-IM++ achieves near-greedy influence spread at up to 100 times lower runtime, while outperforming Community-IM and degree heuristics across budgets and structural conditions. These results demonstrate the practicality of Community-IM++ for large-scale applications such as viral marketing, misinformation control, and public health campaigns, where efficiency and cross-community reach are critical.

Result: 在爱尔兰东部区域，多模态Transformer在多模态输入时优于其他模型，测试集RMSE = 0.90 mm，R² = 0.97。

Conclusion: 多模态基于块的Transformer在地表位移预测中有较好效果。

Abstract: Near-real-time regional-scale monitoring of ground deformation is increasingly required to support urban planning, critical infrastructure management, and natural hazard mitigation. While Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and continental-scale services such as the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) provide dense observations of past motion, predicting the next observation remains challenging due to the superposition of long-term trends, seasonal cycles, and occasional abrupt discontinuities (e.g., co-seismic steps), together with strong spatial heterogeneity. In this study we propose a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series (resampled to a 64x64 grid over 100 km x 100 km tiles). The model ingests recent displacement snapshots together with (i) static kinematic indicators (mean velocity, acceleration, seasonal amplitude) computed in a leakage-safe manner from the training window only, and (ii) harmonic day-of-year encodings. On the eastern Ireland tile (E32N34), the STGCN is strongest in the displacement-only setting, whereas the multimodal Transformer clearly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM+Attn, and multimodal STGCN when all models receive the same multimodal inputs, achieving RMSE = 0.90 mm and $R^2$ = 0.97 on the test set with the best threshold accuracies.

Conclusion: OptiVote框架能在太空数据中心分布式联邦学习中消除精确相位同步需求，提高动态损伤下的恢复能力，且动态功率控制方案可减轻聚合偏差。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of mega-constellations is driving the long-term vision of space data centers (SDCs), where interconnected satellites form in-orbit distributed computing and learning infrastructures. Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.

Abstract: Semantic communications conveys task-relevant meaning rather than focusing solely on message reconstruction, improving bandwidth efficiency and robustness for next-generation wireless systems. However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task. This comprehensive framework motivates semantic communication designs with tunable, end-to-end privacy against adaptive adversaries in realistic wireless settings.

Motivation: 传统基于意图的网络方法无法保证生成配置的可行性，需要新的网络管理框架。

Result: 框架能动态更新VM放置和路由并保持可行性，LLM提取器精度高，Sentence - BERT+SVM低延迟。

Conclusion: 结合NLP意图提取和优化分配对虚拟网络管理有效。

Abstract: This paper proposes a chat-driven network management framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) with optimization-based virtual network allocation, enabling intuitive and reliable reconfiguration of virtual network services. Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.

Result: 在部分情况下实现了0.02%的压缩率，能在消费级GPU上快速推理。

Conclusion: GVC为带宽和资源受限环境下的视频通信提供了有效、高效、可扩展且实用的新范式。

Abstract: Whether a video can be compressed at an extreme compression rate as low as 0.01%? To this end, we achieve the compression rate as 0.02% at some cases by introducing Generative Video Compression (GVC), a new framework that redefines the limits of video compression by leveraging modern generative video models to achieve extreme compression rates while preserving a perception-centric, task-oriented communication paradigm, corresponding to Level C of the Shannon-Weaver model. Besides, How we trade computation for compression rate or bandwidth? GVC answers this question by shifting the burden from transmission to inference: it encodes video into extremely compact representations and delegates content reconstruction to the receiver, where powerful generative priors synthesize high-quality video from minimal transmitted information. Is GVC practical and deployable? To ensure practical deployment, we propose a compression-computation trade-off strategy, enabling fast inference on consume-grade GPUs. Within the AI Flow framework, GVC opens new possibility for video communication in bandwidth- and resource-constrained environments such as emergency rescue, remote surveillance, and mobile edge computing. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that GVC offers a viable path toward a new effective, efficient, scalable, and practical video communication paradigm.

Conclusion: 该方法无需激进图像预处理或感兴趣区域裁剪即有稳健表现，且能更好区分非诊断帧。

Abstract: Congenital heart disease remains the most common congenital anomaly and a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although first-trimester fetal echocardiography offers an opportunity for earlier detection, automated analysis at this stage is challenging due to small cardiac structures, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial inter-operator variability. In this work, we evaluate a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model, USF-MAE, for first-trimester fetal heart view classification. USF-MAE is pretrained using masked autoencoding modelling on more than 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images spanning over 40 anatomical regions and is subsequently fine-tuned for downstream classification. As a proof of concept, the pretrained Vision Transformer encoder was fine-tuned on an open-source dataset of 6,720 first-trimester fetal echocardiography images to classify five categories: aorta, atrioventricular flows, V sign, X sign, and Other. Model performance was benchmarked against supervised convolutional neural network baselines (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) model pretrained on natural images (ImageNet-1k). All models were trained and evaluated using identical preprocessing, data splits, and optimization protocols. On an independent test set, USF-MAE achieved the highest performance across all evaluation metrics, with 90.57% accuracy, 91.15% precision, 90.57% recall, and 90.71% F1-score. This represents an improvement of +2.03% in accuracy and +1.98% in F1-score compared with the strongest baseline, ResNet-18. The proposed approach demonstrated robust performance without reliance on aggressive image preprocessing or region-of-interest cropping and showed improved discrimination of non-diagnostic frames.

Conclusion: 提供了在有限数据下基于学习的多维图像重建新策略。

Abstract: We present a new approach for representing and reconstructing multidimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Our method builds on a novel, learned feature-based image representation that disentangles different types of features, such as geometry and contrast, into distinct low-dimensional latent spaces, enabling better exploitation of feature correlations in multidimensional images and incorporation of pre-learned priors specific to different feature types for reconstruction. More specifically, the disentanglement was achieved via an encoderdecoder network and image transfer training using large public data, enhanced by a style-based decoder design. A latent diffusion model was introduced to impose stronger constraints on distinct feature spaces. New reconstruction formulations and algorithms were developed to integrate the learned representation with a zero-shot selfsupervised learning adaptation and subspace modeling. The proposed method has been evaluated on accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, without task-specific supervised training or fine-tuning. This work offers a new strategy for learning-based multidimensional image reconstruction where only limited data are available for problem-specific or task-specific training.

Motivation: 传统推断 $r$-Pareto 过程需知道整个过程 $X$，但实际中仅能在分散站点观测 $X$，需解决数据不足问题。

Method: 在贝叶斯框架下提出两步MCMC算法，第一步根据观测值对 $X$ 采样评估哪些观测导致 $r$-超越值，第二步用超越值对 $r$-Pareto 过程参数后验分布采样。

Result: 第一步中观测被分类为 $r$-超越值的概率收敛到期望概率，第二步构建的马尔科夫链分布收敛到感兴趣的后验分布，在模拟研究中与标准贝叶斯程序对比。

Conclusion: 提出的两步MCMC算法可以解决在数据有限的情况下对随机过程 $X$ 极值进行推断的问题，且算法具有良好的收敛性质。

Abstract: In order to describe the extremal behaviour of some stochastic process $X$, approaches from univariate extreme value theory are typically generalized to the spatial domain. In particular, generalized peaks-over-threshold approaches allow for the consideration of single extreme events. These can be flexibly defined as exceedances of a risk functional $r$, such as a spatial average, applied to $X$. Inference for the resulting limit process, the so-called $r$-Pareto process, requires the evaluation of $r(X)$ and thus the knowledge of the whole process $X$. In many practical applications, however, observations of $X$ are only available at scattered sites. To overcome this issue, we propose a two-step MCMC-algorithm in a Bayesian framework. In a first step, we sample from $X$ conditionally on the observations in order to evaluate which observations lead to $r$-exceedances. In a second step, we use these exceedances to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters of the limiting $r$-Pareto process. Alternating these steps results in a full Bayesian model for the extremes of $X$. We show that, under appropriate assumptions, the probability of classifying an observation as $r$-exceedance in the first step converges to the desired probability. Furthermore, given the first step, the distribution of the Markov chain constructed in the second step converges to the posterior distribution of interest. The procedure is compared to the Bayesian version of the standard procedure in a simulation study.

Abstract: Random probability measures, together with their constructions, representations, and associated algorithms, play a central role in modern Bayesian inference. A key class is that of proper species sampling processes, which offer a relatively simple yet versatile framework that extends naturally to non-exchangeable settings. We revisit this class from a computational perspective and show that they admit exact finite mixture representations. In particular, we prove that any proper species sampling process can be written, at the prior level, as a finite mixture with a latent truncation variable and reweighted atoms, while preserving its distributional features exactly. These finite formulations can be used as drop-in replacements in Bayesian mixture models, recasting posterior computation in terms of familiar finite-mixture machinery. This yields straightforward MCMC implementations and tractable expressions, while avoiding ad hoc truncations and model-specific constructions. The resulting representation preserves the full generality of the original infinite-dimensional priors while enabling practical gains in algorithm design and implementation.

Conclusion: 结果虽不能替代PDF拟合，但可作为强大诊断工具评估现有拟合方法合理性，还为机器学习学习过程理论提供测试平台。

Abstract: Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) play a central role in describing experimental data at colliders and provide insight into the structure of nucleons. As the LHC enters an era of high-precision measurements, a robust PDF determination with a reliable uncertainty quantification has become mandatory in order to match the experimental precision. The NNPDF collaboration has pioneered the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for PDF determinations, using Neural Networks (NNs) to parametrise the unknown PDFs in a flexible and unbiased way. The NNs are then trained on experimental data by means of stochastic gradient descent algorithms. The statistical robustness of the results is validated by extensive closure tests using synthetic data. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to analyse the training dynamics of neural networks. This approach allows us to derive, under precise assumptions, an analytical description of the neural network evolution during training, enabling a quantitative understanding of the training process. Having an analytical handle on the training dynamics allows us to clarify the role of the NN architecture and the impact of the experimental data in a transparent way. Similarly, we are able to describe the evolution of the covariance of the NN output during training, providing a quantitative description of how uncertainties are propagated from the data to the fitted function. While our results are not a substitute for PDF fitting, they do provide a powerful diagnostic tool to assess the robustness of current fitting methodologies. Beyond its relevance for particle physics phenomenology, our analysis of PDF determinations provides a testbed to apply theoretical ideas about the learning process developed in the ML community.

ModEn-Hub centralizes entanglement sources and shared quantum memory to deliver on-demand, high-fidelity Bell pairs across heterogeneous QPUs, while the control plane schedules teleportation-based non-local gates, launches parallel entanglement attempts, and maintains a small ebit cache. To quantify benefits, we implement a lightweight, reproducible Monte Carlo study under realistic loss and tight round budgets, comparing a naive sequential baseline to an orchestrated policy with logarithmically scaled parallelism and opportunistic caching. Across 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub-style orchestration sustains about 90% teleportation success while the baseline degrades toward about 30%, at the cost of higher average entanglement attempts (about 10-12 versus about 3). These results provide clear, high-level evidence that adaptive resource orchestration in the ModEn-Hub enables scalable and efficient quantum-HPC operation on near-term hardware.

Conclusion: 该方法有扩展到高维Burgers系统和更通用量子偏微分方程求解器的潜力，学习误差缓解可作为NISQ设备基于物理降噪技术的补充。

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) are a central computational tool in quantum science and artificial intelligence. However, the lack of unified software interface across tensor-computing frameworks severely limits the portability of TN applications, coupling algorithmic development to specific hardware and software back ends. To address this challenge, we introduce the Tensor Computing Interface (TCI) -- an application-oriented, lightweight application programming interface designed to enable framework-independent, high-performance TN applications. TCI provides a well-defined type system that abstracts tensor objects together with a minimal yet expressive set of core functions covering essential tensor manipulations and tensor linear-algebra operations. Through numerical demonstrations on representative tensor-network applications, we show that codes written against TCI can be migrated seamlessly across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms while achieving performance comparable to native framework implementations. We further release an open-source implementation of TCI based on \textit{Cytnx}, demonstrating its practicality and ease of integration with existing tensor-computing frameworks.

Abstract: Neural quantum states efficiently represent many-body wavefunctions with neural networks, but the cost of Monte Carlo sampling limits their scaling to large system sizes. Here we address this challenge by combining sparse Boltzmann machine architectures with probabilistic computing hardware. We implement a probabilistic computer on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and use it as a fast sampler for energy-based neural quantum states. For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures.

Conclusion: 量子生成模型仍存在量子优势，但来源并非反集中。

Abstract: Sampling tasks have been successful in establishing quantum advantages both in theory and experiments. This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration.

Abstract: The accurate estimation of free energy differences between two states is a long-standing challenge in molecular simulations. Traditional approaches generally rely on sampling multiple intermediate states to ensure sufficient overlap in phase space and are, consequently, computationally expensive. Several generative-model-based methods have recently addressed this challenge by learning a direct bridge between distributions, bypassing the need for intermediate states. However, it remains unclear which approaches provide the best trade-off between efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. In this work, we systematically review these methods and benchmark selected approaches with a focus on condensed-matter systems. In particular, we investigate the performance of discrete and continuous normalizing flows in the context of targeted free energy perturbation as well as FEAT (Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport) together with the escorted Jarzynski equality, using coarse-grained monatomic ice and Lennard-Jones solids as benchmark systems. We evaluate accuracy, data efficiency, computational cost, and scalability with system size. Our results provide a quantitative framework for selecting effective free energy estimation strategies in condensed-phase systems.

Abstract: As wireless communication applications evolve from traditional multipath environments to high-mobility scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles, multiplexing techniques have advanced accordingly. Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored.

Abstract: We investigate the statistical accuracy of temporally interpolated spatiotemporal flow sequences between sparse, decorrelated snapshots of turbulent flow fields using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The developed method is presented as a proof-of-concept generative surrogate for reconstructing coherent turbulent dynamics between sparse snapshots, demonstrated on a 2D Kolmogorov Flow, and a 3D Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI). We analyse the generated flow sequences through the lens of statistical turbulence, examining the time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy spectra over generated sequences, and temporal decay of turbulent structures. For the non-stationary Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability, we assess the ability of the proposed method to capture evolving flow statistics across the most strongly time-varying flow regime. We additionally examine instantaneous fields and physically motivated metrics at key stages of the KHI flow evolution.

Result: 生成的3D qMRI图精度高、噪声低、结构细节保留好，仅用合成数据训练也能很好泛化到真实扫描。

Conclusion: MuPa - ZTE采集与物理信息扩散模型结合的q3 - MuPa框架有很强临床潜力。

Abstract: The 3D fast silent multi-parametric mapping sequence with zero echo time (MuPa-ZTE) is a novel quantitative MRI (qMRI) acquisition that enables nearly silent scanning by using a 3D phyllotaxis sampling scheme. MuPa-ZTE improves patient comfort and motion robustness, and generates quantitative maps of T1, T2, and proton density using the acquired weighted image series. In this work, we propose a diffusion model-based qMRI mapping method that leverages both a deep generative model and physics-based data consistency to further improve the mapping performance. Furthermore, our method enables additional acquisition acceleration, allowing high-quality qMRI mapping from a fourfold-accelerated MuPa-ZTE scan (approximately 1 minute). Specifically, we trained a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to map MuPa-ZTE image series to qMRI maps, and we incorporated the MuPa-ZTE forward signal model as an explicit data consistency (DC) constraint during inference. We compared our mapping method against a baseline dictionary matching approach and a purely data-driven diffusion model. The diffusion models were trained entirely on synthetic data generated from digital brain phantoms, eliminating the need for large real-scan datasets. We evaluated on synthetic data, a NISM/ISMRM phantom, healthy volunteers, and a patient with brain metastases. The results demonstrated that our method produces 3D qMRI maps with high accuracy, reduced noise and better preservation of structural details. Notably, it generalised well to real scans despite training on synthetic data alone. The combination of the MuPa-ZTE acquisition and our physics-informed diffusion model is termed q3-MuPa, a quick, quiet, and quantitative multi-parametric mapping framework, and our findings highlight its strong clinical potential.

Method: 形式化两个核心行为Adversarial和Alignment，通过对生成内容的概率约束进行操作，构建BEDA框架，包含世界集、信念估计器和条件生成器。

Result: 在CKBG、Mutual Friends和CaSiNo三个场景中，BEDA均优于强基线模型，在CKBG中成功率至少提高5.0分，使用GPT - 4.1 - nano时提高20.6分；在Mutual Friends中平均提高9.3分；在CaSiNo中达成最优交易。

Conclusion: 将信念估计转化为约束为可靠的战略对话提供了简单、通用的机制。

Abstract: Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.

Abstract: This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.

Conclusion: AdaGReS 在不同情况下能改善端到端答案质量和鲁棒性

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.

Conclusion: 三角测量法为多语言模型机械解释提供了可证伪标准。

Abstract: Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.

Our approach combines: (1) STED (Semantic Tree Edit Distance), a novel similarity metric balancing semantic flexibility with structural strictness when comparing JSON outputs, and (2) a consistency scoring framework aggregating multiple STED measurements across repeated generations to quantify reliability. Through systematic experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled schema, expression, and semantic variations, we demonstrate STED achieves superior performance ($0.86-0.90$ similarity for semantic equivalents, $0.0$ for structural breaks) compared to existing metrics including TED, BERTScore, and DeepDiff. Applying our framework to benchmark six LLMs reveals significant variations: Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrates exceptional consistency, maintaining near-perfect structural reliability even at high temperatures ($T=0.9$), while models like Claude-3-Haiku and Nova-Pro exhibit substantial degradation requiring careful tuning. Our framework enables practical applications including targeted model selection for structured tasks, iterative prompt refinement for reproducible results, and diagnostic analysis to identify inconsistency root causes. This work provides theoretical foundations and practical tools for ensuring reliable structured output generation in LLM-based production systems.

TL;DR: 提出BanglaCodeAct框架解决孟加拉语到Python代码生成问题，Qwen3 - 8B搭配该框架表现最佳，为孟加拉语到Python翻译建立了新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在英语提示的代码生成方面表现出色，但在低资源语言上进展不足，本文旨在解决孟加拉语到Python的代码生成问题。

Method: 引入基于代理的BanglaCodeAct框架，利用多代理提示和迭代自我修正，在Thought - Code - Observation循环中使用开源多语言大语言模型，对多个小参数开源大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: Qwen3 - 8B搭配BanglaCodeAct框架表现最佳，开发集pass@1准确率达94.0%，盲测集达71.6%。

Conclusion: 为孟加拉语到Python翻译建立了新基准，凸显了基于代理推理在低资源语言可靠代码生成方面的潜力。

Abstract: LLMs excel at code generation from English prompts, but this progress has not extended to low-resource languages. We address Bangla-to-Python code generation by introducing BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based framework that leverages multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. Unlike prior approaches relying on task-specific fine-tuning, BanglaCodeAct employs an open-source multilingual LLM within a Thought-Code-Observation loop, enabling dynamic generation, testing, and refinement of code from Bangla instructions. We benchmark several small-parameter open-source LLMs and evaluate their effectiveness on the mHumanEval dataset for Bangla NL2Code. Our results show that Qwen3-8B, when deployed with BanglaCodeAct, achieves the best performance, with pass@1 accuracy of 94.0\% on the development set and 71.6\% on the blind test set. These results establish a new benchmark for Bangla-to-Python translation and highlight the potential of agent-based reasoning for reliable code generation in low-resource languages.

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型安全机制忽略隐蔽威胁，本文提出HarmTransform框架生成隐蔽有害查询转换以改进安全对齐，实验显示其效果好，但辩论有双刃剑效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型安全对齐方法主要关注明显危险内容，忽略隐蔽威胁，且现有安全训练数据存在差距。

Method: 引入HarmTransform多智能体辩论框架，通过多智能体间的迭代批判和改进来生成隐蔽有害查询转换。

Result: HarmTransform在生成有效查询转换方面显著优于标准基线，辩论有双刃剑效应。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论在生成全面安全训练数据方面既有前景也有局限。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with safety mechanisms to detect and block harmful queries, yet current alignment approaches primarily focus on overtly dangerous content and overlook more subtle threats. However, users can often disguise harmful intent through covert rephrasing that preserves malicious objectives while appearing benign, which creates a significant gap in existing safety training data. To address this limitation, we introduce HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework for systematically transforming harmful queries into stealthier forms while preserving their underlying harmful intent. Our framework leverages iterative critique and refinement among multiple agents to generate high-quality, covert harmful query transformations that can be used to improve future LLM safety alignment. Experiments demonstrate that HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations. At the same time, our analysis reveals that debate acts as a double-edged sword: while it can sharpen transformations and improve stealth, it may also introduce topic shifts and unnecessary complexity. These insights highlight both the promise and the limitations of multi-agent debate for generating comprehensive safety training data.

Motivation: 网络性别歧视内容形式隐蔽，传统检测方法失效，数据存在标注不一致、标签稀缺和类别不平衡问题，需要新设计解决。

Method: 提出两阶段框架，训练阶段采用类平衡焦点损失、类感知批处理和事后阈值校准；推理阶段用动态路由机制，不确定实例交由CEJ模块处理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得SOTA结果，EXIST 2025任务1.1的F1提高2.72%，EDOS任务A和B分别提高4.48%和1.30%。

Conclusion: 所提两阶段框架有效应对网络隐蔽性别歧视内容检测问题，能处理数据和预测中的不足。

Abstract: Sexist content online increasingly appears in subtle, context-dependent forms that evade traditional detection methods. Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to adapt supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. Our training setup applies class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. At inference time, a dynamic routing mechanism classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a novel \textit{Collaborative Expert Judgment} (CEJ) module, which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks, with a +2.72\% improvement in F1 on the EXIST 2025 Task 1.1, and a gains of +4.48\% and +1.30\% on the EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively.

Motivation: 当前服务机器人缺乏常识推理能力，难以完成日常物品存储位置推断任务，因此提出Stored Household Item Challenge评估认知能力。

Method: 创建包含两个数据集的基准任务，提出NOAM混合代理管道，将视觉输入转为自然语言，借助语言模型推断物品存储位置。

Result: NOAM与多个基线模型及人类表现对比，显著提升预测准确率，接近人类水平。

Conclusion: 展示了在家庭环境中部署有认知能力代理的最佳实践。

Abstract: ``Bring me a plate.'' For domestic service robots, this simple command reveals a complex challenge: inferring where everyday items are stored, often out of sight in drawers, cabinets, or closets. Despite advances in vision and manipulation, robots still lack the commonsense reasoning needed to complete this task. We introduce the Stored Household Item Challenge, a benchmark task for evaluating service robots' cognitive capabilities: given a household scene and a queried item, predict its most likely storage location.
  Our benchmark includes two datasets: (1) a real-world evaluation set of 100 item-image pairs with human-annotated ground truth from participants' kitchens, and (2) a development set of 6,500 item-image pairs annotated with storage polygons over public kitchen images. These datasets support realistic modeling of household organization and enable comparative evaluation across agent architectures.
  To begin tackling this challenge, we introduce NOAM (Non-visible Object Allocation Model), a hybrid agent pipeline that combines structured scene understanding with large language model inference. NOAM converts visual input into natural language descriptions of spatial context and visible containers, then prompts a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to infer the most likely hidden storage location. This integrated vision-language agent exhibits emergent commonsense reasoning and is designed for modular deployment within broader robotic systems.
  We evaluate NOAM against baselines including random selection, vision-language pipelines (Grounding-DINO + SAM), leading multimodal models (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o, Kosmos-2, LLaMA, Qwen), and human performance. NOAM significantly improves prediction accuracy and approaches human-level results, highlighting best practices for deploying cognitively capable agents in domestic environments.

Motivation: 现有投机解码中草稿模型和目标模型过度对齐，限制其性能，需改进。

Method: 在标准投机解码基础上，加入基于动态熵的惩罚，利用采样分布的熵量化模型不确定性，对高熵且预测重叠的标记进行拒绝和重采样。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，EASD 始终优于现有投机解码方法，多数情况下超越目标大语言模型，效率与投机解码相当。

Conclusion: EASD 是一种有效的无训练增强方法，能突破目标大语言模型性能限制。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates large language model (LLM) reasoning by using a small draft model to generate candidate tokens, which the target LLM either accepts directly or regenerates upon rejection. However, excessive alignment between the draft and target models constrains SD to the performance of the target LLM. To address this limitation, we propose Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), a training-free enhancement. Building on standard SD, EASD incorporates a dynamic entropy-based penalty. At each decoding step, we employ the entropy of the sampling distribution to quantify model uncertainty. When both models exhibit high entropy with substantial overlap among their top-N predictions, the corresponding token is rejected and re-sampled by the target LLM. This penalty prevents low-confidence errors from propagating. By incorporating draft-model verification, EASD enables the possibility of surpassing the target model's inherent performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EASD consistently outperforms existing SD methods and, in most cases, surpasses the target LLM itself. We further prove that the efficiency of EASD is comparable to that of SD. The code can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

Motivation: 慢性压力普遍存在，社交媒体是人们分享经历的重要场所，需有效方法检测推文里的慢性压力。

Method: 提出StressRoBERTa跨条件迁移学习方法，在相关临床病症语料库持续训练，在SMM4H 2022 Task 8数据集微调。

Result: StressRoBERTa的F1分数达82%，比最佳共享任务系统高3个百分点，在Dreaddit上F1分数为81%。

Conclusion: 聚焦压力相关病症的跨条件迁移学习比一般心理健康训练提供更强表征，可从临床心理健康场景迁移到情景压力讨论。

Abstract: The prevalence of chronic stress represents a significant public health concern, with social media platforms like Twitter serving as important venues for individuals to share their experiences. This paper introduces StressRoBERTa, a cross-condition transfer learning approach for automatic detection of self-reported chronic stress in English tweets. The investigation examines whether continual training on clinically related conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD), disorders with high comorbidity with chronic stress, improves stress detection compared to general language models and broad mental health models. RoBERTa is continually trained on the Stress-SMHD corpus (108M words from users with self-reported diagnoses of depression, anxiety, and PTSD) and fine-tuned on the SMM4H 2022 Task 8 dataset. StressRoBERTa achieves 82% F1-score, outperforming the best shared task system (79% F1) by 3 percentage points. The results demonstrate that focused cross-condition transfer from stress-related disorders (+1% F1 over vanilla RoBERTa) provides stronger representations than general mental health training. Evaluation on Dreaddit (81% F1) further demonstrates transfer from clinical mental health contexts to situational stress discussions.

Motivation: 当前对偏见检测模型的决策方式和失败原因了解甚少，需要对模型进行可解释性研究。

Method: 使用基于SHAP的解释方法，分析两个在BABE数据集上微调的模型，对比正确和错误预测的词级归因。

Result: 两个模型关注相似的评价语言类别，但信号整合方式不同；偏见检测器模型假阳性归因强度高，域自适应模型假阳性少63%；模型错误源于不同语言机制。

Conclusion: 可解释性评估对偏见检测系统很重要，架构和训练选择影响模型可靠性和适用性。

Abstract: Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.

Result: 在三个开放域问答数据集上，自适应策略用更少令牌达到与标准提示相同性能。

Conclusion: 大语言模型遇信息不足常答错，需进一步研究增强其拒绝请求能力。

Abstract: The success of expanded context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven increased use of broader context in retrieval-augmented generation. We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.

Result: 基于注意力的对抗样本使评估性能下降，且语义与原输入相似，但部分替换会导致语法退化。

Conclusion: 使用中间层表示作为对抗样本有潜力，但目前存在局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability suggest that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses that are iteratively refined toward the final output. In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions, producing perturbations that are both plausible and internally consistent with the model's own generation process. We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using intermediate-layer representations as a principled source of adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM-based evaluation pipelines.

Conclusion: HGMem能将内存扩展为动态、可表达结构，适用于复杂推理和全局理解，提升多步检索增强生成性能。

Abstract: Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat ZigZag Attention (LoZA), which is a sparse attention scheme designed to transform any existing full-attention models into sparse versions with rather limited compute budget. In long-context scenarios, LoZA can achieve significant speed-ups both for prefill-intensive (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) and decode-intensive (e.g., tool-integrated reasoning) cases. Specifically, by applying LoZA to LongCat-Flash during mid-training, we serve LongCat-Flash-Exp as a long-context foundation model that can swiftly process up to 1 million tokens, enabling efficient long-term reasoning and long-horizon agentic capabilities.

Conclusion: 无监督潜在发现对解释和可控引导大语言模型推理有潜力。

Abstract: Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: iCLP方法能提升大语言模型推理的准确性和效率，有强跨领域泛化能力，保留思维链推理可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), when guided by explicit textual plans, can perform reliable step-by-step reasoning during problem-solving. However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma are increasingly used in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, law, and finance, yet their reliability remains uncertain. They often make overconfident errors, degrade under input shifts, and lack clear uncertainty estimates. Existing evaluations are fragmented, addressing only isolated aspects. We introduce the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified framework that integrates calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification into a single interpretable metric. Through experiments on ten leading open-source LLMs across five QA datasets, we assess performance under baselines, perturbations, and calibration methods. CRS delivers stable model rankings, uncovers hidden failure modes missed by single metrics, and highlights that the most dependable systems balance accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty.

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown strong performance in word- and sentence-level tasks, effectively representing long documents, especially in fields like law and medicine, remains difficult. Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动文本摘要在低资源语言上受关注较少，需探索适合低资源语言的摘要方法。

Method: 对比不同摘要方法，包括大、小语言模型的零样本提示、mT5微调、数据增强、多语言迁移，以及大语言模型翻译流水线方法。

Result: 不同参数规模相近的大语言模型表现有差异，多语言微调mT5基线在多数指标上优于其他方法，大语言模型评判在低资源语言上可能不可靠。

Conclusion: 多语言微调mT5基线在低资源语言文本摘要上有较好表现，使用大语言模型评判需谨慎。

Abstract: Automatic text summarization has achieved high performance in high-resourced languages like English, but comparatively less attention has been given to summarization in less-resourced languages. This work compares a variety of different approaches to summarization from zero-shot prompting of LLMs large and small to fine-tuning smaller models like mT5 with and without three data augmentation approaches and multilingual transfer. We also explore an LLM translation pipeline approach, translating from the source language to English, summarizing and translating back. Evaluating with five different metrics, we find that there is variation across LLMs in their performance across similar parameter sizes, that our multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms most other approaches including zero-shot LLM performance for most metrics, and that LLM as judge may be less reliable on less-resourced languages.

Conclusion: 未提及

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has primarily been driven by resource-rich research groups and industry partners. Due to the lack of on-premise computing resources required for increasingly complex models, many researchers are turning to cloud services like AWS SageMaker to train Hugging Face models. However, the steep learning curve of cloud platforms often presents a barrier for researchers accustomed to local environments. Existing documentation frequently leaves knowledge gaps, forcing users to seek fragmented information across the web. This demo paper aims to democratize cloud adoption by centralizing the essential information required for researchers to successfully train their first Hugging Face model on AWS SageMaker from scratch.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DATAMASK框架用于大规模预训练数据选择，能同时优化多种指标，可大幅减少选择时间并提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于质量或多样性指标的样本选择方法存在局限，且很少在单一选择过程中同时考虑多种指标，影响预训练大语言模型能力。

Method: 将选择过程视为掩码学习问题，通过迭代采样数据掩码、计算策略梯度和更新掩码采样对数来优化。

Result: 相比贪心算法，选择时间减少98.9%；从15万亿token的FineWeb数据集中选出约10%的子集FineWeb - Mask，在12个不同任务评估中，1.5B密集模型提升3.2%，7B MoE模型提升1.9%。

Conclusion: DATAMASK是一种高效的大规模预训练数据联合选择框架，能有效优化多种指标，提升模型性能。

Abstract: A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.

Motivation: LLM长链思维推理存在效率低、推理不稳定的问题。

Method: 研究推理轨迹结构，找出与特定认知行为相关的注意力头，提出CREST方法，包括离线校准和推理时旋转隐藏表征。

Result: 在多个推理基准和模型上，CREST准确率最高提升17.5%，减少37.6%的token使用。

Conclusion: CREST是一种简单有效的方法，可实现更快、更可靠的LLM推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型能否预测任务成功率、多步任务中预测能力是否提升，以及能否从上下文经验学习以在失败代价高的场景做决策。

Method: 对大语言模型开展测试。

Result: 多数模型过度自信但有一定判别力，新且大的模型判别力未必更强，多步任务中部分模型过度自信加剧，部分模型能从上下文经验降低过度自信，所有模型决策近似理性但因估计乐观而不佳。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型智能体受能力认知不足阻碍，探讨了相关意识对AI滥用及失准风险的影响。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.

Motivation: 构建基于论证记忆的多轮辩论生成框架，以实现辩论过程中观点一致性、有效回应对手和用证据支持主张。

Method: 整合辩论知识库和基于角色的代理，在标准化ORCHID辩论上进行评估，设置两项任务，采用InspireScore和Debatrix评分。

Result: 与强LLM基线相比，R - Debater在单轮和多轮得分更高，20位经验丰富辩手的人类评估确认其一致性和证据使用情况良好。

Conclusion: 将检索基础与结构化规划相结合能产生更忠实、立场一致且连贯的多轮辩论。

Abstract: We present R-Debater, an agentic framework for generating multi-turn debates built on argumentative memory. Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.

Motivation: 个性化AI代理访问用户敏感数据带来隐私风险，缺乏社会背景感知的系统可能泄露用户秘密。

Method: 引入PrivacyBench基准，含社会背景数据集和多轮对话评估，测试RAG助手。

Result: RAG助手最高26.56%交互中泄露秘密，隐私感知提示可降至5.12%，但检索机制仍有问题。

Conclusion: 当前架构不安全，急需结构上的隐私设计保障措施。

Abstract: Personalized AI agents rely on access to a user's digital footprint, which often includes sensitive data from private emails, chats and purchase histories. Yet this access creates a fundamental societal and privacy risk: systems lacking social-context awareness can unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator. This creates a single point of failure, rendering current architectures unsafe for wide-scale deployment. Our findings underscore the urgent need for structural, privacy-by-design safeguards to ensure an ethical and inclusive web for everyone.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型基准测试主要在问题层面整理问题，存在易数据污染、单知识点评估、依赖专家标注成本高的局限。

Method: 从权威教科书中提取独立知识陈述，并在测试时通过随机抽样动态组成评估问题。

Result: 在超50个LLMs上实验，Encyclo - K有强区分力，顶级的OpenAI - GPT - 5.1准确率仅62.07%，模型性能有梯度分布。

Conclusion: Encyclo - K是可扩展框架，可动态评估LLMs对多学科细粒度知识陈述的综合理解。

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.

Motivation: Hyper - Connections在提高性能同时，破坏了残差连接的恒等映射特性，导致训练不稳定、可扩展性受限和内存访问开销大。

Method: 提出mHC框架，将HC的残差连接空间投影到特定流形以恢复恒等映射特性，并进行基础设施优化。

Result: 经验实验表明mHC可用于大规模训练，有性能提升和更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: mHC作为HC的灵活实用扩展，有助于深入理解拓扑架构设计，并为基础模型发展提供方向。

Abstract: Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.

Method: 提出ADOPT框架，显式建模各LLM步骤与最终任务结果的依赖，解耦文本梯度估计和更新，采用基于Shapley的机制分配优化资源。

Result: 在真实数据集和不同管道结构上实验，ADOPT有效且稳健。

Conclusion: ADOPT在多步LLM管道提示优化方面优于现有最先进的提示优化基线。

Abstract: Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.

Method: 引入TG模型，以句子为单位生成标记，交叉关注先前句子表征的记忆，使用同一组参数和单一目标进行训练。

Result: 在扩展实验中，TG比匹配的GPT - 2运行效率更高，GPT - 2需更多数据和参数才能达到TG的损失；TG还减少了父子反转诅咒探测中的关系方向泛化错误。

Conclusion: TG模型在效率和关系方向泛化上有优势，能改善现有Transformer语言模型的问题。

Abstract: Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level "thought" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.

Method: 提出RepoMech方法，可多边净额结算回购交易且不改变对手风险。

Result: 未提及具体结果

Conclusion: RepoMech方法可避免集中清算的一些弊端。

Abstract: A repo trade involves the sale of a security coupled with a contract to repurchase at a later time. Following the 2008 financial crisis, accounting standards were updated to require repo intermediaries, who are mostly banks, to increase recorded assets at the time of the first transaction. Concurrently, US bank regulators implemented a supplementary leverage ratio constraint that reduces the volume of assets a bank is allowed record. The interaction of the new accounting rules and bank regulations limits the volume of repo trades that banks can intermediate. To reduce the balance-sheet impact of repo, the SEC has mandated banks to centrally clear all Treasuries trades. This achieves multilateral netting but shifts counterparty risk onto the clearinghouse, which can distort monitoring incentives and raise trading cost through the imposition of fees. We present RepoMech, a method that avoids these pitfalls by multilaterally netting repo trades without altering counterparty risk.

Result: 考虑全球不平等使区域差异化碳价格下排放降低21%，全球统一碳价格提高15%。

Conclusion: 考虑全球不平等会降低最优全球排放，有利于全球气候政策。

Abstract: How should nations price carbon? This paper examines how the treatment of global inequality, captured by regional welfare weights, affects optimal carbon prices. I develop theory to identify the conditions under which accounting for differences in marginal utilities of consumption across countries leads to more stringent global climate policy in the absence of international transfers. I further establish a connection between the optimal uniform carbon prices implied by different welfare weights and heterogeneous regional preferences over climate policy stringency. In calibrated simulations, I find that accounting for global inequality reduces optimal global emissions relative to an inequality-insensitive benchmark. This holds both when carbon prices are regionally differentiated, with emissions 21% lower, and when they are constrained to be globally uniform, with the uniform carbon price 15% higher.

Conclusion: 干预措施的采用反映了多维度的信念和目标，政策选择是一个规模挑战。

Abstract: Why are interventions with weak evidence still adopted? We study charitable incentives for physical activity in Japan using three linked methods, including a randomized field experiment (N=808), a stakeholder belief survey (local government officials and private-sector employees, N=2,400), and a conjoint experiment on policy choice. Financial incentives increase daily steps by about 1,000, whereas charitable incentives deliver a precisely estimated null. Nonetheless, stakeholders greatly overpredict charitable incentives' effects on walking, participation, and prosociality. Conjoint choices show policymakers value step gains as well as other outcomes, shaping policy choice. Adoption thus reflects multidimensional beliefs and objectives, highlighting policy selection as a scaling challenge.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究整合决策自主性、地位信号动机和网购偏好，探究消费者后悔频率的前因，发现其与决策倾向和地位信号有关，网购偏好加剧后悔，为缓解后悔提供管理建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽消费者后悔普遍存在，但对部分消费者频繁后悔缺乏理解，旨在探究消费者后悔频率的前因。

Method: 构建整合决策自主性、地位信号动机和网购偏好的框架，分析338份调查数据。

Result: 后悔频率与决策相关倾向和地位信号的个体差异显著相关，网购偏好加剧后悔消费行为。

Conclusion: 强调后悔频率为持续的消费者结果，零售商可通过增强决策支持等策略缓解后悔不满。

Abstract: Consumer regret is a widespread post-purchase emotion that significantly impacts satisfaction, product returns, complaint behavior, and customer loyalty. Despite its prevalence, there is a limited understanding of why certain consumers experience regret more frequently as a chronic aspect of their engagement in the marketplace. This study explores the antecedents of consumer regret frequency by integrating decision agency, status signaling motivations, and online shopping preferences into a cohesive framework. By analyzing survey data (n=338), we assess whether consumers' perceived agency and decision-making orientation correlate with the frequency of regret, and whether tendencies towards status-related consumption and preferences for online shopping environments exacerbate regret through mechanisms such as increased social comparison, expanded choice sets, and continuous exposure to alternative offers. The findings reveal that regret frequency is significantly linked to individual differences in decision-related orientations and status signaling, with a preference for online shopping further contributing to regret-prone consumption behaviors. These results extend the scope of regret and cognitive dissonance research beyond isolated decision episodes by emphasizing regret frequency as a persistent consumer outcome. From a managerial standpoint, the findings suggest that retailers can alleviate regret-driven dissatisfaction by enhancing decision support, minimizing choice overload, and developing post-purchase reassurance strategies tailored to segments prone to regret..

*Hangcheng Zhao,Ron Berman*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型对新闻行业的影响，发现2024年8月后新闻流量下降，封锁大模型机器人反而减少大型新闻网站流量，暂时未出现岗位替代，大型出版商增加了富媒体内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型给新闻行业在信息获取、数据使用和内容创作上带来变化，预测会对新闻出版商产生负面影响，因此研究其具体影响。

Method: 使用高频粒度数据，采用双重差分法。

Result: 2024年8月后新闻流量适度下降；封锁大语言模型机器人使大型网站总流量降23%、真实用户流量降14%；未发现岗位替代现象，编辑和内容生产岗位招聘占比增加；大型出版商未增加文字内容，而是增加了富媒体内容和广告技术。

Conclusion: 研究为大语言模型对新闻生产和消费的意外影响提供了早期证据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news "slop." Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.
  Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.
  Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为从资源受限嵌入式设备到高性能并行架构的不同系统优化内存管理性能。

Method: 采用由Active VGC和Passive VGC组成的双层架构，Active VGC在运行时用并发标记和清除策略管理对象，Passive VGC在编译时通过预测性内存映射优化静态对象分配。

Result: 多线程基准测试中暂停时间比分代收集器最多减少30%，减少最多25%的总内存使用，最小化内存碎片。

Conclusion: VGC通过集成编译时和运行时优化，为高低级编程环境中的内存密集型系统提供了强大且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The Virtual Garbage Collector (VGC) introduces a novel memory management framework designed to optimize performance across diverse systems, ranging from resource constrained embedded devices to high performance parallel architectures. Unlike conventional garbage collectors, VGC employs a dual layer architecture consisting of Active VGC and Passive VGC to enable efficient, low overhead memory management. Active VGC dynamically manages runtime objects using a concurrent mark and sweep strategy tailored for parallel workloads, reducing pause times by up to 30 percent compared to generational collectors in multithreaded benchmarks. Passive VGC operates at compile time and optimizes static object allocation through predictive memory mapping, minimizing fragmentation by aligning objects to cache boundaries. This separation of responsibilities ensures predictable memory access patterns, reduces total memory usage by up to 25 percent, and improves scalability for modern parallel applications. By integrating compile time and runtime optimizations, VGC provides a robust and adaptable solution for memory intensive systems across both low level and high level programming environments.

TL;DR: 提出Agent - C框架确保LLM代理符合正式时间安全属性，在多应用和模型评估中表现良好，实现完美安全并提升任务效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代理在安全关键应用中，现有护栏系统无法防止违反时间安全策略，缺乏对代理行动序列的约束保障。

Method: 引入特定领域语言表达时间属性，转换为一阶逻辑，用SMT求解在令牌生成时检测违规行动，利用约束生成技术确保行动合规。

Result: 在零售客服和机票预订系统及多语言模型评估中，Agent - C实现100%合规、0%危害，相比现有技术提升了合规性和任务效用。

Conclusion: Agent - C代表了可靠代理推理的新前沿。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are deployed in safety-critical applications, yet current guardrail systems fail to prevent violations of temporal safety policies, requirements that govern the ordering and sequencing of agent actions. For instance, agents may access sensitive data before authenticating users or process refunds to unauthorized payment methods, violations that require reasoning about sequences of action rather than an individual action. Existing guardrails rely on imprecise natural language instructions or post-hoc monitoring, and provide no formal guarantees that agents will satisfy temporal constraints. We present Agent-C, a novel framework that provides run-time guarantees ensuring LLM agents adhere to formal temporal safety properties. Agent-C introduces a domain-specific language for expressing temporal properties (e.g., authenticate before accessing data), translates specifications to first-order logic, and uses SMT solving to detect non-compliant agent actions during token generation. When the LLM attempts to generate a non-compliant tool call, Agent-C leverages constrained generation techniques to ensure that every action generated by the LLM complies with the specification, and to generate a compliant alternative to a non-compliant agent action. We evaluate Agent-C across two real-world applications: retail customer service and airline ticket reservation system, and multiple language models (open and closed-source). Our results demonstrate that Agent-C achieves perfect safety (100% conformance, 0% harm), while improving task utility compared to state-of-the-art guardrails and unrestricted agents. On SoTA closed-source models, Agent-C improves conformance (77.4% to 100% for Claude Sonnet 4.5 and 83.7% to 100% for GPT-5), while simultaneously increasing utility (71.8% to 75.2% and 66.1% to 70.6%, respectively), representing a new SoTA frontier for reliable agentic reasoning.

Motivation: 当前概率编程语言和工具将模型表示与特定推理算法紧密耦合，阻碍了对新表示或混合离散 - 连续模型的实验。

Conclusion: 该方法允许对当前工具包无法充分表达的复杂混合模型进行实际推理。

Abstract: Current probabilistic programming languages and tools tightly couple model representations with specific inference algorithms, preventing experimentation with novel representations or mixed discrete-continuous models. We introduce a factor abstraction with five fundamental operations that serve as a universal interface for manipulating factors regardless of their underlying representation. This enables representation-agnostic probabilistic programming where users can freely mix different representations (e.g. discrete tables, Gaussians distributions, sample-based approaches) within a single unified framework, allowing practical inference in complex hybrid models that current toolkits cannot adequately express.

Conclusion: 所提出的 AMM 机制在本地能源共享市场有效，能带来显著的贸易收益。

Abstract: We develop an axiomatic theory for Automated Market Makers (AMMs) in local energy sharing markets and analyze the Markov Perfect Equilibrium of the resulting economy with a Mean-Field Game. In this game, heterogeneous prosumers solve a Bellman equation to optimize energy consumption, storage, and exchanges. Our axioms identify a class of mechanisms with linear, Lipschitz continuous payment functions, where prices decrease with the aggregate supply-to-demand ratio of energy. We prove that implementing batch execution and concentrated liquidity allows standard design conditions from decentralized finance-quasi-concavity, monotonicity, and homotheticity-to construct AMMs that satisfy our axioms. The resulting AMMs are budget-balanced and achieve ex-ante efficiency, contrasting with the strategy-proof, expost optimal VCG mechanism. Since the AMM implements a Potential Game, we solve its equilibrium by first computing the social planner's optimum and then decentralizing the allocation. Numerical experiments using data from the Paris administrative region suggest that the prosumer community can achieve gains from trade up to 40% relative to the grid-only benchmark.

Motivation: 在一些领域应用中，要从随机向量的倾斜分布生成样本，但底层分布未知，需讨论倾斜分布的自归一化重要性采样器的渐近效率。

Method: 根据样本数量和倾斜程度，对自归一化重要性采样器的准确性进行刻画。

Result: 对于有界随机向量，准确倾斜所需样本数随倾斜量多项式增长；对于无界分布，样本数超多项式增长。

Abstract: Consider the task of generating samples from a tilted distribution of a random vector whose underlying distribution is unknown, but samples from it are available. This finds applications in fields such as finance and climate science, and in rare event simulation. In this article, we discuss the asymptotic efficiency of a self-normalized importance sampler of the tilted distribution. We provide a sharp characterization of its accuracy, given the number of samples and the degree of tilt. Our findings reveal a surprising dichotomy: while the number of samples needed to accurately tilt a bounded random vector increases polynomially in the tilt amount, it increases at a super polynomial rate for unbounded distributions.

Method: 采用模块化方案，将分数采样转化为一系列易解决的采样问题，设计前向轨迹使终端分布和反向条件分布由强对数凹分布定义，利用强对数凹采样算法。

Conclusion: 该模块化方案能有效解决基于分数的采样问题，为单峰和多峰密度建立了新的保证。

Abstract: Sampling based on score diffusions has led to striking empirical results, and has attracted considerable attention from various research communities. It depends on availability of (approximate) Stein score functions for various levels of additive noise. We describe and analyze a modular scheme that reduces score-based sampling to solving a short sequence of ``nice'' sampling problems, for which high-accuracy samplers are known. We show how to design forward trajectories such that both (a) the terminal distribution, and (b) each of the backward conditional distribution is defined by a strongly log concave (SLC) distribution. This modular reduction allows us to exploit \emph{any} SLC sampling algorithm in order to traverse the backwards path, and we establish novel guarantees with short proofs for both uni-modal and multi-modal densities. The use of high-accuracy routines yields $\varepsilon$-accurate answers, in either KL or Wasserstein distances, with polynomial dependence on $\log(1/\varepsilon)$ and $\sqrt{d}$ dependence on the dimension.

Result: 证明隐式得分匹配能适应内在维度，与去噪得分匹配有相同收敛率；两种方法可无维度灾难地估计对数密度Hessians。

Conclusion: 证明了基于ODE的生成扩散模型采样器的收敛性。

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the score function using both implicit score matching and denoising score matching. Assuming that the data distribution exhibiting a low-dimensional structure, we prove that implicit score matching is able not only to adapt to the intrinsic dimension, but also to achieve the same rates of convergence as denoising score matching in terms of the sample size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both methods allow us to estimate log-density Hessians without the curse of dimensionality by simple differentiation. This justifies convergence of ODE-based samplers for generative diffusion models. Our approach is based on Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type inequalities relating weighted $L^2$-norms of smooth functions and their derivatives.

Abstract: We introduce \textit{basic inequalities} for first-order iterative optimization algorithms, forming a simple and versatile framework that connects implicit and explicit regularization. While related inequalities appear in the literature, we isolate and highlight a specific form and develop it as a well-rounded tool for statistical analysis. Let $f$ denote the objective function to be optimized. Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $θ_0$ with current iterate $θ_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(θ_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $θ_0$, $θ_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function. We demonstrate this framework through analyses of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds. In addition to revisiting and refining known results on gradient descent, we provide new results for mirror descent with Bregman divergence projection, for generalized linear models trained by gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent, and for randomized predictors. We illustrate and supplement these theoretical findings with experiments on generalized linear models.

Abstract: Large data-driven physics models like DeepMind's weather model GraphCast have empirically succeeded in parameterizing time operators for complex dynamical systems with an accuracy reaching or in some cases exceeding that of traditional physics-based solvers. Unfortunately, how these data-driven models perform computations is largely unknown and whether their internal representations are interpretable or physically consistent is an open question. Here, we adapt tools from interpretability research in Large Language Models to analyze intermediate computational layers in GraphCast, leveraging sparse autoencoders to discover interpretable features in the neuron space of the model. We uncover distinct features on a wide range of length and time scales that correspond to tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, diurnal and seasonal behavior, large-scale precipitation patterns, specific geographical coding, and sea-ice extent, among others. We further demonstrate how the precise abstraction of these features can be probed via interventions on the prediction steps of the model. As a case study, we sparsely modify a feature corresponding to tropical cyclones in GraphCast and observe interpretable and physically consistent modifications to evolving hurricanes. Such methods offer a window into the black-box behavior of data-driven physics models and are a step towards realizing their potential as trustworthy predictors and scientifically valuable tools for discovery.

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 所提投影式对抗攻击方法能有效验证DNN单目深度估计模型的脆弱性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

Motivation: 现代视觉模型推理成本高，现有DMSS方法无法泛化到不同工作负载。

Method: 使用测量驱动的规划器估计采样的成本效益权衡，用轻量级数据驱动的性能模型改进准确率预测。

Result: 在多种视频、模型和任务中，RedunCut在固定准确率下降低14 - 62%的计算成本，对有限历史数据和漂移保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RedunCut有效解决了现有DMSS方法的问题，能降低计算成本。

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction.

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有文本引导分割方法在初始定位错误时难以验证、重新聚焦和细化的问题。

Method: 提出RSAgent通过多轮工具调用推理和行动，构建数据管道合成轨迹，采用两阶段框架训练。

Result: RSAgent在ReasonSeg测试中零样本性能达66.5% gIoU，在RefCOCOg上达81.5% cIoU。

Conclusion: RSAgent在域内和域外基准上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Motivation: 长视频编辑因联合编辑和DDIM反演计算成本指数增加面临挑战，需解决此限制。

Method: 1. 基于SSIM和光流进行运动分析，跳过低运动帧编辑；2. 提出流水线任务调度算法，按GPU内存并行处理视频分段；3. 用神经网络插值技术平滑分段边界帧和插值跳过帧。

Conclusion: PipeFlow可解决长视频编辑难题，避免其他方法每帧计算开销增长问题，能编辑任意长视频。

Abstract: Long-form video editing poses unique challenges due to the exponential increase in the computational cost from joint editing and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion across extended sequences. To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods. PipeFlow achieves up to a 9.6X speedup compared to TokenFlow and a 31.7X speedup over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT).

Abstract: Pathology context and expert experience play significant roles in clinical ocular disease diagnosis. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have good ocular disease recognition results, they often ignore exploring the clinical pathology context and expert experience priors to improve ocular disease recognition performance and decision-making interpretability. To this end, we first develop a novel Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage the potential of pathology context prior via the combination of the well-designed pixel-wise context compression operator and pathology distribution concentration operator; then this paper applies a novel expert prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to further highlight significant pixel-wise representation regions by fully mining the expert experience prior. By incorporating PRM and EPGA into the modern DNN, the PCRNet is constructed for automated ocular disease recognition. Additionally, we introduce an Integrated Loss (IL) to boost the ocular disease recognition performance of PCRNet by considering the effects of sample-wise loss distributions and training label frequencies. The extensive experiments on three ocular disease datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCRNet with IL over state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods. Further visualization analysis explains the inherent behavior of PRM and EPGA that affects the decision-making process of DNNs.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，能解决现有视频语言模型在事件级感知时间定位的问题。

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

Conclusion: 为基于LLM的计算机视觉架构搜索提供实用指南，建立严格评估方法，让资源有限的研究者也能开展自动化设计。

Abstract: Automated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.

Motivation: 解决RGB - D图像重建点云因自遮挡导致马铃薯重量估计系统低估的问题。

Method: 引入PointRAFT点云回归网络，利用对象高度嵌入，直接从原始3D数据推断目标值。

Result: 在测试集上平均绝对误差12.0克，均方根误差17.2克，优于线性回归和PointNet++，平均推理时间6.3毫秒/点云，支持每秒处理150个块茎。

Conclusion: PointRAFT可用于马铃薯重量估计，还适用于多种3D表型和机器人感知任务。

Abstract: Potato yield is a key indicator for optimizing cultivation practices in agriculture. Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks. The code, network weights, and a subset of the dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/pieterblok/pointraft.git.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少模型幻觉，有较强泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

Conclusion: 该框架为计算机辅助诊断和临床教育提供实用、数据高效的途径，弥合罕见病差距。

Abstract: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, restricting the data available for developing reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and training novice clinicians. Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.

Method: 开发Virtual - Eyes管道，计算切片级嵌入，训练无泄漏的患者级MLP头，对比不同模型在原始和经过Virtual - Eyes处理输入下的表现。

Conclusion: 解剖学针对性的质量控制能稳定和提升通用基础模型工作流程，但可能破坏适应原始临床环境的专业模型。

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

Conclusion: 公开DermaVQA - DAS、DAS模式和评估协议，支持并加速以患者为中心的皮肤病视觉语言模型研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论，但暗示低级特征能提供更严格调节且可描述小图像块。

Abstract: With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.

Motivation: 高光谱成像分析因数据量大有计算瓶颈，预训练基础模型表示难迁移到特定领域应用。

Method: 提出Deep Global Clustering (DGC)框架，基于小的重叠区域补丁学习全局聚类结构，无需预训练。

Result: 在叶病数据集实现背景组织分离（平均IoU 0.925），可进行无监督疾病检测，但存在优化不稳定问题。

Conclusion: 该设计理念有价值，但稳定实现需有原则的动态损失平衡方法。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型因训练和数据不足，生成低概率区域图像质量差，CFG会导致样本过简或失真，其他引导方法有局限。

Method: 提出Internal Guidance(IG)策略，在训练时对中间层引入辅助监督，采样时外推中间层和深层输出得到生成结果。

Result: 在多个基线模型上，训练效率和生成质量显著提升，如SiT - XL/2+IG、LightningDiT - XL/1+IG等取得不同FID值。

Conclusion: 提出的IG策略有效，结合CFG可达到当前最优FID值。

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

Conclusion: 实验成功证明了该模型在疫情期间用不平衡数据进行医学图像分类的有效性。

Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced data is prominent in medical image classification. This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.

Motivation: 当前最先进的FER模型泛化能力弱，真实场景表现不佳，现有解决架构需跨域训练与实际应用矛盾。

Method: 以Meta - Sapiens为骨干构建MotivNet，作为Sapiens的下游任务，定义三个标准评估其可行性。

Result: MotivNet跨域可泛化，能与现有SOTA模型对比且满足评估标准。

Conclusion: MotivNet可作为Sapiens下游任务，使FER在真实场景应用更具吸引力。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model for robust real-world application. Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

Conclusion: 物理启发的RGTN方法有效，可用于张量网络结构搜索。

Abstract: Tensor network structure search (TN-SS) aims to automatically discover optimal network topologies and rank configurations for efficient tensor decomposition in high-dimensional data representation. Despite recent advances, existing TN-SS methods face significant limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness across diverse tensor characteristics. They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.

Abstract: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

Result: EVOL - SAM3在零样本设置下大幅超越静态基线模型，在具有挑战性的ReasonSeg基准上显著优于全监督的最先进方法。

Conclusion: EVOL - SAM3是一种有效的零样本推理分割框架，解决了现有方法的诸多问题。

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advancements in 3D segmentation techniques and the development of specialized 3D benchmark datasets to improve post-disaster scene understanding and response.

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

Motivation: Noise2Noise训练虽无需干净目标图像，但对噪声目标应用非线性函数会使结果有偏差，且常见的非线性函数限制了对噪声目标的预处理类型，同时该方法处理HDR图像有问题。

Method: 开发理论框架分析特定非线性函数影响，找到一类偏差最小的非线性函数；研究损失函数和色调映射函数的特定组合以减少异常值影响并降低偏差。

Conclusion: 某些非线性函数可应用于噪声目标而不显著增加偏差，特定的损失和色调映射函数组合能有效处理HDR图像去噪问题。

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

Besides, we firstly restore a low-resolution result and use it as global residual to mitigate blocky artifacts caused by patching process.Furthermore, we construct a film restoration dataset that contains restored real-degraded films and realistic synthetic data.Comprehensive experimental results conclusively demonstrate the superiority of our model in defect restoration ability over existing open-source methods. Code and the dataset will be released.

Abstract: Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.

Abstract: Compressed deep learning models are crucial for deploying computer vision systems on resource-constrained devices. However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio. Our results show that certain compression strategies not only preserve but can also improve robustness, particularly on networks with more complex architectures. Utilizing multiobjective assessment, we determine the best configurations, showing that customized technique combinations produce beneficial multi-objective results. This study provides insights into selecting compression methods for robust and efficient deployment of models in corrupted real-world environments.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

Motivation: 现有基准多在理想光照条件下评估视觉语言模型，而实际应用需考虑低光照等视觉退化情况，此方面研究被忽视。

Method: 提出DarkEQA基准，在受控退化下从第一人称观察评估问答，在线性RAW空间建模视觉退化，模拟光照下降和传感器噪声并采用ISP启发的渲染管道。

Result: 评估了多种先进的视觉语言模型和低光照图像增强模型，系统揭示了视觉语言模型在低光照视觉条件下的局限性。

Conclusion: DarkEQA可用于评估视觉语言模型在低光照条件下的性能，有助于提升其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: SpaceTimePilot能有效实现可控的时空分离生成渲染。

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Abstract: Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for understanding brain function, while neural activity in the brain is inherently spike-based. This paper bridges these two perspectives by designing spiking neural networks that simulate Bayesian inference through message passing for Bernoulli messages. To train the networks, we employ spike-timing-dependent plasticity, a biologically plausible mechanism for synaptic plasticity which is based on the Hebbian rule. Our results demonstrate that the network's performance closely matches the true numerical solution. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by implementing a factor graph example from coding theory, illustrating signal transmission over an unreliable channel.

Abstract: Sequential structure is a key feature of multiple domains of natural cognition and behavior, such as language, movement and decision-making. Likewise, it is also a central property of tasks to which we would like to apply artificial intelligence. It is therefore of great importance to develop frameworks that allow us to evaluate sequence learning and processing in a domain agnostic fashion, whilst simultaneously providing a link to formal theories of computation and computability. To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms. The tool is modular, openly available and accessible to the research community.

Motivation: 研究不同方法求解一维色散PDE孤波解的优劣。

Method: 对比经典数值求解器（如Petviashvili方法、有限差分结合牛顿迭代）、神经网络方法（PINNs）和算子学习方法。

Result: 经典方法对单实例问题精度高、效率强；PINNs能给出定性解，但低维下精度和效率不如经典方法；算子学习方法训练时计算量大，但可跨参数重用，预训练后推理快，单实例计算精度一般低于经典方法和PINNs。

Conclusion: 不同方法各有优劣，应根据具体问题（单实例、重复模拟或实时预测）选择合适方法。

Abstract: We present a comparative study of classical numerical solvers, such as Petviashvili's method or finite difference with Newton iterations, and neural network-based methods for computing ground states or profiles of solitary-wave solutions to the one-dimensional dispersive PDEs that include the nonlinear Schrödinger, the nonlinear Klein-Gordon and the generalized KdV equations. We confirm that classical approaches retain high-order accuracy and strong computational efficiency for single-instance problems in the one-dimensional setting. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are also able to reproduce qualitative solutions but are generally less accurate and less efficient in low dimensions than classical solvers due to expensive training and slow convergence. We also investigate the operator-learning methods, which, although computationally intensive during training, can be reused across many parameter instances, providing rapid inference after pretraining, making them attractive for applications involving repeated simulations or real-time predictions. For single-instance computations, however, the accuracy of operator-learning methods remains lower than that of classical methods or PINNs, in general.

Result: PINNs 比有限差分法慢 90000 倍且误差大；DeepONet 需要大量训练模拟，且需数百万次评估才相当；多层感知机外推表现差；GNS 有潜力但有局限性；自动微分求解反问题可秒级实现亚百分比精度。

Conclusion: 反问题用自动微分；应用基于场地的交叉验证；神经网络用于传统求解器成本高且预测在训练范围内的问题；性能差的方法不能替代成熟求解器。

Abstract: Deep learning methods -- physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), deep operator networks (DeepONet), and graph network simulators (GNS) -- are increasingly proposed for geotechnical problems. This paper tests these methods against traditional solvers on canonical problems: wave propagation and beam-foundation interaction. PINNs run 90,000 times slower than finite difference with larger errors. DeepONet requires thousands of training simulations and breaks even only after millions of evaluations. Multi-layer perceptrons fail catastrophically when extrapolating beyond training data -- the common case in geotechnical prediction. GNS shows promise for geometry-agnostic simulation but faces scaling limits and cannot capture path-dependent soil behavior. For inverse problems, automatic differentiation through traditional solvers recovers material parameters with sub-percent accuracy in seconds. We recommend: use automatic differentiation for inverse problems; apply site-based cross-validation to account for spatial autocorrelation; reserve neural networks for problems where traditional solvers are genuinely expensive and predictions remain within the training envelope. When a method is four orders of magnitude slower with less accuracy, it is not a viable replacement for proven solvers.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the automated simulation and reporting pipeline implemented for our autonomous racing stack, ur.autopilot. The backbone of the simulation is based on a high-fidelity model of the vehicle interfaced as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU). The pipeline can execute the software stack and the simulation up to three times faster than real-time, locally or on GitHub for Continuous Integration/- Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). As the most important input of the pipeline, there is a set of running scenarios. Each scenario allows the initialization of the ego vehicle in different initial conditions (position and speed), as well as the initialization of any other configuration of the stack. This functionality is essential to validate efficiently critical modules, like the one responsible for high-speed overtaking maneuvers or localization, which are among the most challenging aspects of autonomous racing. Moreover, we describe how we implemented a fault injection module, capable of introducing sensor delays and perturbations as well as modifying outputs of any node of the stack. Finally, we describe the design of our automated reporting process, aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of the simulation analysis.

Conclusion: ERIQ和FACT为诊断和克服推理 - 精度权衡提供了框架，推动了鲁棒、通用的机器人操作。

Abstract: General-purpose robotic systems operating in open-world environments must achieve both broad generalization and high-precision action execution, a combination that remains challenging for existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) improve semantic generalization, insufficient embodied reasoning leads to brittle behavior, and conversely, strong reasoning alone is inadequate without precise control. To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization. To bridge the gap from reasoning to precise execution, we propose FACT, a flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control into discrete sequences while preserving high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction. The resulting GenieReasoner jointly optimizes reasoning and action in a unified space, outperforming both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world tasks. Together, ERIQ and FACT provide a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming the reasoning-precision trade-off, advancing robust, general-purpose robotic manipulation.

Result: DRL - TH在多种拥挤环境实验中优于现有方法，实车测试表现良好。

Conclusion: DRL - TH框架有效解决了现有方法的问题，在UGV自主导航和避障中有良好应用效果。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have demonstrated potential for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in crowded environments. Most existing approaches rely on single-frame observation and employ simple concatenation for multi-modal fusion, which limits their ability to capture temporal context and hinders dynamic adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based navigation framework, DRL-TH, which leverages temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to integrate historical observations and adaptively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a temporal-guided graph attention network (TG-GAT) that incorporates temporal weights into attention scores to capture correlations between consecutive frames, thereby enabling the implicit estimation of scene evolution. In addition, we design a graph hierarchical abstraction module (GHAM) that applies hierarchical pooling and learnable weighted fusion to dynamically integrate RGB and LiDAR features, achieving balanced representation across multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DRL-TH outperforms existing methods in various crowded environments. We also implemented DRL-TH control policy on a real UGV and showed that it performed well in real world scenarios.

Abstract: The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained vision-language model (VLM) fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots operating in complex, dynamic environments face the dual challenge of navigating large-scale, structurally diverse spaces with static obstacles while safely interacting with various moving agents. Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.

Conclusion: 语言引导的潜在分类为自动驾驶语义安全监控提供了有效且可部署的机制。

Abstract: Real-world autonomous driving must adhere to complex human social rules that extend beyond legally codified traffic regulations. Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has emerged as a compelling tool to zero-shot reason about plausible physical interactions for open-world manipulation. Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold great promise for operating in human-centric environments, yet achieving robust whole-body coordination across the head, hands, and legs remains a major challenge. We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.

Motivation: 提案数量增长使同行评审成天文学发展瓶颈，需自动化部分流程确保公平分配和可重复性决策。

Method: 提出AstroReview框架，分三步自动化提案评审，通过任务隔离和显式推理轨迹减少幻觉并提高透明度。

Result: AstroReview在最后阶段识别真接受提案准确率达87%；AstroReview in Action模块使修订草案接受率两轮迭代后提高66%。

Conclusion: 研究结果为资源有限的设施提供了可扩展、可审计且高吞吐量提案评审的实用路径。

Abstract: Competitive access to modern observatories has intensified as proposal volumes outpace available telescope time, making timely, consistent, and transparent peer review a critical bottleneck for the advancement of astronomy. Automating parts of this process is therefore both scientifically significant and operationally necessary to ensure fair allocation and reproducible decisions at scale. We present AstroReview, an open-source, agent-based framework that automates proposal review in three stages: (i) novelty and scientific merit, (ii) feasibility and expected yield, and (iii) meta-review and reliability verification. Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains. Together, these results point to a practical path toward scalable, auditable, and higher throughput proposal review for resource limited facilities.

Motivation: 改进用CFFT方法对期权估值时的边界误差。

Method: 修改原公式中的阻尼和移位方案，采用时间相关的移位。

Result: 时间相关的移位显著减少了边界误差，数值结果和误差分析显示改进的卷积方法有更高准确性和收敛性。

Conclusion: 通过修改方案能有效改善CFFT方法求解时的边界误差问题。

Abstract: We first review the convolution fast-Fourier-transform (CFFT) approach for the numerical solution of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) introduced in (Hyndman and Oyono Ngou, 2017). We then propose a method for improving the boundary errors obtained when valuing options using this approach. We modify the damping and shifting schemes used in the original formulation, which transforms the target function into a bounded periodic function so that Fourier transforms can be applied successfully. Time-dependent shifting reduces boundary error significantly. We present numerical results for our implementation and provide a detailed error analysis showing the improved accuracy and convergence of the modified convolution method.

Motivation: 为深度梯度流方法求解（高维）偏微分方程提供坚实的数学基础。

Method: 将深度梯度流方法的泛化误差分解为近似误差和训练误差，证明满足假设的偏微分方程解可被神经网络近似，推导‘宽网络极限’下训练过程遵循的梯度流并分析其随训练时间的极限。

Conclusion: 深度梯度流方法在求解偏微分方程上具有理论上的可行性，泛化误差可随神经元数量和训练时间的增加而趋近于零。

Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide a firm mathematical foundation for the application of deep gradient flow methods (DGFMs) for the solution of (high-dimensional) partial differential equations (PDEs). We decompose the generalization error of DGFMs into an approximation and a training error. We first show that the solution of PDEs that satisfy reasonable and verifiable assumptions can be approximated by neural networks, thus the approximation error tends to zero as the number of neurons tends to infinity. Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity. These results combined show that the generalization error of DGFMs tends to zero as the number of neurons and the training time tend to infinity.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于近端算子与HJ偏微分方程联系的深度学习架构，能有效解决高维逆问题中的先验学习问题，且相比现有方法更有优势。

Abstract: Inverse problems are important mathematical problems that seek to recover model parameters from noisy data. Since inverse problems are often ill-posed, they require regularization or incorporation of prior information about the underlying model or unknown variables. Proximal operators, ubiquitous in nonsmooth optimization, are central to this because they provide a flexible and convenient way to encode priors and build efficient iterative algorithms. They have also recently become key to modern machine learning methods, e.g., for plug-and-play methods for learned denoisers and deep neural architectures for learning priors of proximal operators. The latter was developed partly due to recent work characterizing proximal operators of nonconvex priors as subdifferential of convex potentials. In this work, we propose to leverage connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs) to develop novel deep learning architectures for learning the prior. In contrast to other existing methods, we learn the prior directly without recourse to inverting the prior after training. We present several numerical results that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in high dimensions.

Motivation: 现有基准无法充分衡量组织现代数学所需的抽象和库介导推理能力，需新的基准。

Method: 创建LeanCat基准，包含100个任务，分主题和难度层级，使用LLM辅助和人工评分，评估模型及LeanBridge。

Result: 最佳模型在pass@1解决8.25%的任务，pass@4解决12.00%的任务，LeanBridge比单模型基线有持续提升。

Conclusion: LeanCat可作为紧凑、可复用的检查点，追踪AI和人类在可靠研究级形式化方面的进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in formal theorem proving, yet current benchmarks under-measure the kind of abstraction and library-mediated reasoning that organizes modern mathematics. In parallel with FATE's emphasis on frontier algebra, we introduce LeanCat, a Lean benchmark for category-theoretic formalization -- a unifying language for mathematical structure and a core layer of modern proof engineering -- serving as a stress test of structural, interface-level reasoning. Part I: 1-Categories contains 100 fully formalized statement-level tasks, curated into topic families and three difficulty tiers via an LLM-assisted + human grading process. The best model solves 8.25% of tasks at pass@1 (32.50%/4.17%/0.00% by Easy/Medium/High) and 12.00% at pass@4 (50.00%/4.76%/0.00%). We also evaluate LeanBridge which use LeanExplore to search Mathlib, and observe consistent gains over single-model baselines. LeanCat is intended as a compact, reusable checkpoint for tracking both AI and human progress toward reliable, research-level formalization in Lean.

Result: 逻辑的公理化体系是可靠的，必要性和充分性片段是完备的，逻辑语言能表示推广后的形式概念分析概念，可扩展到多关系模糊背景推理。

Conclusion: 所引入的逻辑在模糊形式背景推理和形式概念分析中有良好应用，且有进一步扩展的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a two-sort weighted modal logic for possibilistic reasoning with fuzzy formal contexts. The syntax of the logic includes two types of weighted modal operators corresponding to classical necessity ($\Box$) and sufficiency ($\boxminus$) modalities and its formulas are interpreted in fuzzy formal contexts based on possibility theory. We present its axiomatization that is \emph{sound} with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. In addition, both the necessity and sufficiency fragments of the logic are also individually complete with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. We highlight the expressive power of the logic with some illustrative examples. As a formal context is the basic construct of formal concept analysis (FCA), we generalize three main notions in FCA, i.e., formal concepts, object oriented concepts, and property oriented concepts, to their corresponding $c$-cut concepts in fuzzy formal contexts. Then, we show that our logical language can represent all three of these generalized notions. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of extending our logic to reasoning with multi-relational fuzzy contexts, in which the Boolean combinations of different fuzzy relations are allowed.

Conclusion: 所提出的SNN解决方案在UWB信道估计任务上有良好表现，为未来神经形态实践带来显著优势。

Abstract: Although existing deep learning-based Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) channel estimation methods achieve high accuracy, their computational intensity clashes sharply with the resource constraints of low-cost edge devices. Motivated by this, this letter explores the potential of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for this task and develops a fully unsupervised SNN solution. To enable a comprehensive performance analysis, we devise an extensive set of comparative strategies and evaluate them on a compelling public benchmark. Experimental results show that our unsupervised approach still attains 80% test accuracy, on par with several supervised deep learning-based strategies. Moreover, compared with complex deep learning methods, our SNN implementation is inherently suited to neuromorphic deployment and offers a drastic reduction in model complexity, bringing significant advantages for future neuromorphic practice.

Result: 将测试应用于两项预测任务。

Conclusion: 该测试为评估大语言模型生成的预测的有效性和可靠性提供了一种经济高效的诊断工具。

Abstract: We develop a statistical test to detect lookahead bias in economic forecasts generated by large language models (LLMs). Using state-of-the-art pre-training data detection techniques, we estimate the likelihood that a given prompt appeared in an LLM's training corpus, a statistic we term Lookahead Propensity (LAP). We formally show that a positive correlation between LAP and forecast accuracy indicates the presence and magnitude of lookahead bias, and apply the test to two forecasting tasks: news headlines predicting stock returns and earnings call transcripts predicting capital expenditures. Our test provides a cost-efficient, diagnostic tool for assessing the validity and reliability of LLM-generated forecasts.

Motivation: 研究巴西K - 12教育教师对通用AI在教育中应用的看法。

Method: 定量分析，通过对346名来自巴西不同地区、不同背景的教育工作者的问卷进行分析。

Result: 多数教育工作者AI知识有限，但对AI应用兴趣浓厚，尤其在创建互动内容、课程规划和个性化评估方面；认识到AI促进包容和个性化学习的潜力；强调讨论伦理和数字公民问题；存在缺乏培训、技术支持和基础设施等挑战；巴西AI整合处于自下而上模式。

Conclusion: 巴西K - 12教育中有效实施AI需综合公共政策、充足教师培训和公平技术接入，以推动道德、包容和因地制宜的AI应用。

Abstract: This study examines the perceptions of Brazilian K-12 education teachers regarding the use of AI in education, specifically General Purpose AI. This investigation employs a quantitative analysis approach, extracting information from a questionnaire completed by 346 educators from various regions of Brazil regarding their AI literacy and use. Educators vary in their educational level, years of experience, and type of educational institution. The analysis of the questionnaires shows that although most educators had only basic or limited knowledge of AI (80.3\%), they showed a strong interest in its application, particularly for the creation of interactive content (80.6%), lesson planning (80.2%), and personalized assessment (68.6%). The potential of AI to promote inclusion and personalized learning is also widely recognized (65.5%). The participants emphasized the importance of discussing ethics and digital citizenship, reflecting on technological dependence, biases, transparency, and responsible use of AI, aligning with critical education and the development of conscious students. Despite enthusiasm for the pedagogical potential of AI, significant structural challenges were identified, including a lack of training (43.4%), technical support (41.9%), and limitations of infrastructure, such as low access to computers, reliable Internet connections, and multimedia resources in schools. The study shows that Brazil is still in a bottom-up model for AI integration, missing official curricula to guide its implementation and structured training for teachers and students. Furthermore, effective implementation of AI depends on integrated public policies, adequate teacher training, and equitable access to technology, promoting ethical, inclusive, and contextually grounded adoption of AI in Brazilian K-12 education.

TL;DR: 研究调查大语言模型（LLMs）如何呈现美国气候观点的交叉模式，发现LLMs压缩了观点多样性，存在交叉性偏差，可能破坏公平气候治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当AI在公众和政策制定者间起中介作用时，跨交叉身份的准确性很重要，此前无研究将LLM输出与真实人类回应对比，气候政策领域对此需求迫切。

Method: 用美国全国代表性气候意见调查的978名受访者资料提示六个LLMs，并将AI生成回应与实际人类答案在20个问题上进行对比。

Result: LLMs压缩了美国气候观点的多样性，预测结果存在偏差，且这种压缩具有交叉性，对不同种族的性别假设存在误判。

Conclusion: 这些可能被标准审计方法忽视的模式，可能会破坏公平的气候治理。

Abstract: Federal agencies and researchers increasingly use large language models to analyze and simulate public opinion. When AI mediates between the public and policymakers, accuracy across intersecting identities becomes consequential; inaccurate group-level estimates can mislead outreach, consultation, and policy design. While research examines intersectionality in LLM outputs, no study has compared these outputs against real human responses across intersecting identities. Climate policy is one such domain, and this is particularly urgent for climate change, where opinion is contested and diverse. We investigate how LLMs represent intersectional patterns in U.S. climate opinions. We prompted six LLMs with profiles of 978 respondents from a nationally representative U.S. climate opinion survey and compared AI-generated responses to actual human answers across 20 questions. We find that LLMs appear to compress the diversity of American climate opinions, predicting less-concerned groups as more concerned and vice versa. This compression is intersectional: LLMs apply uniform gender assumptions that match reality for White and Hispanic Americans but misrepresent Black Americans, where actual gender patterns differ. These patterns, which may be invisible to standard auditing approaches, could undermine equitable climate governance.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应停止算法能让开发者证明其搜索是充分的，框架可根据不同假设得到更强的界。

Abstract: Recent scholarship has argued that firms building data-driven decision systems in high-stakes domains like employment, credit, and housing should search for "less discriminatory algorithms" (LDAs) (Black et al., 2024). That is, for a given decision problem, firms considering deploying a model should make a good-faith effort to find equally performant models with lower disparate impact across social groups. Evidence from the literature on model multiplicity shows that randomness in training pipelines can lead to multiple models with the same performance, but meaningful variations in disparate impact. This suggests that developers can find LDAs simply by randomly retraining models. Firms cannot continue retraining forever, though, which raises the question: What constitutes a good-faith effort? In this paper, we formalize LDA search via model multiplicity as an optimal stopping problem, where a model developer with limited information wants to produce strong evidence that they have sufficiently explored the space of models. Our primary contribution is an adaptive stopping algorithm that yields a high-probability upper bound on the gains achievable from a continued search, allowing the developer to certify (e.g., to a court) that their search was sufficient. We provide a framework under which developers can impose stronger assumptions about the distribution of models, yielding correspondingly stronger bounds. We validate the method on real-world credit, employment and housing datasets.

Motivation: 在信息过载背景下，研究删除信息是否能减少冗余、提高信噪比，以及删除与其他策略的关系。

Method: 通过一系列问卷和访谈，研究51名知识工作者组织、归档和检索数字资源的策略。

Result: 与归档等策略相比，删除操作使用不足，且实证数据表明删除对检索成功和满意度有不利影响。

Conclusion: 详细分析表明删除操作具有负面影响。

Abstract: In a world of information overload, understanding how we can most effectively manage information is crucial to success. We set out to understand how people view deletion, the removal of material no longer needed: does it help by reducing clutter and improving the signal to noise ratio, or does the effort required to decide to delete something make it not worthwhile? How does deletion relate to other strategies like filing; do people who spend extensive time in filing also prune their materials too? We studied the behaviour of 51 knowledge workers though a series of questionnaires and interviews to evaluate a range of tactics they used aimed at organizing, filing, and retrieving digital resources. Our study reveals that deletion is consistently under-adopted compared to other tactics such as Filing, Coverage, Ontology, and Timeliness. Moreover, the empirical data indicate that deletion is actually detrimental to retrieval success and satisfaction. In this paper, we examine the practice of deletion, review the related literature, and present detailed statistical results and clustering outcomes that underscore its adverse effects.

Motivation: 虽AI有提供心理健康支持潜力，但不清楚在极端心理健康危机场景中如何发挥，故探索人们在危机中使用对话式AI的体验。

Method: 进行53人的亲身经历证言调查，对16位心理健康专家进行访谈，运用改变阶段模型分析。

Result: 人们因难接触专业人员或怕麻烦他人而用AI填补人际支持空白；专家认为人际连接在危机管理中重要；负责任的AI危机干预应提升用户采取积极行动的准备并降低消极行动意图。

Conclusion: 应将对话式AI设计为人际连接的桥梁而非目的本身。

Abstract: Online, people often recount their experiences turning to conversational AI agents (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) for mental health support -- going so far as to replace their therapists. These anecdotes suggest that AI agents have great potential to offer accessible mental health support. However, it's unclear how to meet this potential in extreme mental health crisis use cases. In this work, we explore the first-person experience of turning to a conversational AI agent in a mental health crisis. From a testimonial survey (n = 53) of lived experiences, we find that people use AI agents to fill the in-between spaces of human support; they turn to AI due to lack of access to mental health professionals or fears of burdening others. At the same time, our interviews with mental health experts (n = 16) suggest that human-human connection is an essential positive action when managing a mental health crisis. Using the stages of change model, our results suggest that a responsible AI crisis intervention is one that increases the user's preparedness to take a positive action while de-escalating any intended negative action. We discuss the implications of designing conversational AI agents as bridges towards human-human connection rather than ends in themselves.

Motivation: 现代操作系统和分布式系统的资源管理任务依赖手动设计启发式算法，此过程昂贵且耗时，且因硬件、工作负载和环境变化需不断重复。

Method: 利用代码生成大语言模型合成实例最优启发式算法，Vulcan通过对LLM友好、与任务无关的接口分离策略和机制，通过进化搜索寻找高性能策略。

Result: 用Vulcan合成的缓存逐出和内存分层启发式算法，分别比人类设计的最先进算法性能提高了69%和7.9%。

Conclusion: 使用代码生成大语言模型合成实例最优启发式算法是可行且有效的，能显著提升资源管理任务的性能。

Abstract: Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.
  We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed -- using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.
  We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively.

We present Economic Denial Security (EDS), a detection-independent framework that makes attacks economically infeasible by exploiting a fundamental asymmetry: defenders control their environment while attackers cannot. EDS composes four mechanisms adaptive computational puzzles, decoy-driven interaction entropy, temporal stretching, and bandwidth taxation achieving provably superlinear cost amplification. We formalize EDS as a Stackelberg game, deriving closed-form equilibria for optimal parameter selection (Theorem 1) and proving that mechanism composition yields 2.1x greater costs than the sum of individual mechanisms (Theorem 2). EDS requires < 12KB memory, enabling deployment on ESP32 class microcontrollers. Evaluation on a 20-device heterogeneous IoT testbed across four attack scenarios (n = 30 trials, p < 0.001) demonstrates: 32-560x attack slowdown, 85-520:1 cost asymmetry, 8-62% attack success reduction, < 20ms latency overhead, and close to 0% false positives. Validation against IoT-23 malware (Mirai, Torii, Hajime) shows 88% standalone mitigation; combined with ML-IDS, EDS achieves 94% mitigation versus 67% for IDS alone a 27% improvement. EDS provides detection-independent protection suitable for resource-constrained environments where traditional approaches fail. The ability to detect and mitigate the malware samples tested was enhanced; however, the benefits provided by EDS were realized even without the inclusion of an IDS. Overall, the implementation of EDS serves to shift the economic balance in favor of the defender and provides a viable method to protect IoT and edge systems methodologies.

Motivation: 房地产行业依赖人工处理文档，效率低且易欺诈，需自动化解决方案。

Result: 模型在多文档类型上准确率有竞争力，端到端流程减少验证时间且保持可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力简化房地产交易，增强利益相关者信任，实现可扩展、安全的数字流程。

Abstract: The real estate sector remains highly dependent on manual document handling and verification, making processes inefficient and prone to fraud. This work presents a system that integrates optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), and verifiable credentials (VCs) to automate document extraction, verification, and management. The approach standardizes heterogeneous document formats into VCs and applies automated data matching to detect inconsistencies, while the blockchain provides a decentralized trust layer that reinforces transparency and integrity. A prototype was developed that comprises (i) an OCR-NLP extraction pipeline trained on synthetic datasets, (ii) a backend for credential issuance and management, and (iii) a frontend supporting issuer, holder, and verifier interactions. Experimental results show that the models achieve competitive accuracy across multiple document types and that the end-to-end pipeline reduces verification time while preserving reliability. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential to streamline real estate transactions, strengthen stakeholder trust, and enable scalable, secure digital processes.

TL;DR: 研究针对开源包评分系统SourceRank的逃避攻击及其实践可靠性，发现其在现实场景中难以区分好坏包，且URL混淆成为新兴攻击向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前无人深入分析SourceRank应对恶意包分数膨胀的逃避攻击的可靠性，为填补此空白。

Method: 提出攻击模型，鉴定各指标潜在逃避方法；分析MalwareBench数据集及真实世界数据集里好坏包的SourceRank分布。

Result: 现实世界中好坏包的SourceRank分布重叠，因无法及时反映包移除情况；URL混淆是新兴攻击向量，且使用比例上升，常与其他逃避技术联用，可大幅提升恶意包分数。

Conclusion: SourceRank在现实场景中无法可靠区分好坏包或选择良性包。

Abstract: SourceRank is a scoring system made of 18 metrics that assess the popularity and quality of open-source packages. Despite being used in several recent studies, none has thoroughly analyzed its reliability against evasion attacks aimed at inflating the score of malicious packages, thereby masquerading them as trustworthy. To fill this gap, we first propose a threat model that identifies potential evasion approaches for each metric, including the URL confusion technique, which can affect 5 out of the 18 metrics by leveraging a URL pointing to a legitimate repository potentially unrelated to the malicious package.
  Furthermore, we study the reliability of SourceRank in the PyPI ecosystem by analyzing the SourceRank distributions of benign and malicious packages in the state-of-the-art MalwareBench dataset, as well as in a real-world dataset of 122,398 packages. Our analysis reveals that, while historical data suggests a clear distinction between benign and malicious packages, the real-world distributions overlap significantly, mainly due to SourceRank's failure to timely reflect package removals. As a result, SourceRank cannot be reliably used to discriminate between benign and malicious packages in real-world scenarios, nor to select benign packages among those available on PyPI.
  Finally, our analysis reveals that URL confusion represents an emerging attack vector, with its prevalence increasing from 4.2% in MalwareBench to 7.0% in our real-world dataset. Moreover, this technique is often used alongside other evasion techniques and can significantly inflate the SourceRank metrics of malicious packages.

Method: 开发三种分类法组织Web3 RegTech领域，对41个商业平台和28个学术原型进行系统文献分析（2015 - 2025）。

Result: Web3 RegTech能实现交易图分析、实时风险评估等传统系统难实现或较少部署的功能，且发现学术创新与行业部署存在差距，还有一些难题待解决。

Conclusion: 总结架构最佳实践，确定尊重Web3核心原则来解决现有差距的研究方向。

Abstract: The decentralized architecture of Web3 technologies creates fundamental challenges for Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism compliance. Traditional regulatory technology solutions designed for centralized financial systems prove inadequate for blockchain's transparent yet pseudonymous networks. This systematization examines how blockchain-native RegTech solutions leverage distributed ledger properties to enable novel compliance capabilities.
  We develop three taxonomies organizing the Web3 RegTech domain: a regulatory paradigm evolution framework across ten dimensions, a compliance protocol taxonomy encompassing five verification layers, and a RegTech lifecycle framework spanning preventive, real-time, and investigative phases. Through analysis of 41 operational commercial platforms and 28 academic prototypes selected from systematic literature review (2015-2025), we demonstrate that Web3 RegTech enables transaction graph analysis, real-time risk assessment, cross-chain analytics, and privacy-preserving verification approaches that are difficult to achieve or less commonly deployed in traditional centralized systems.
  Our analysis reveals critical gaps between academic innovation and industry deployment, alongside persistent challenges in cross-chain tracking, DeFi interaction analysis, privacy protocol monitoring, and scalability. We synthesize architectural best practices and identify research directions addressing these gaps while respecting Web3's core principles of decentralization, transparency, and user sovereignty.

Conclusion: ASG - SI将智能体自改进重构为可验证、可复用能力的积累，为自改进AI智能体的可重现评估和运营治理提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is increasingly used to transform large language models into agentic systems that act over long horizons, invoke tools, and manage memory under partial observability. While recent work has demonstrated performance gains through tool learning, verifiable rewards, and continual training, deployed self-improving agents raise unresolved security and governance challenges: optimization pressure can incentivize reward hacking, behavioral drift is difficult to audit or reproduce, and improvements are often entangled in opaque parameter updates rather than reusable, verifiable artifacts.
  This paper proposes Audited Skill-Graph Self-Improvement (ASG-SI), a framework that treats self-improvement as iterative compilation of an agent into a growing, auditable skill graph. Each candidate improvement is extracted from successful trajectories, normalized into a skill with an explicit interface, and promoted only after passing verifier-backed replay and contract checks. Rewards are decomposed into reconstructible components derived from replayable evidence, enabling independent audit of promotion decisions and learning signals. ASG-SI further integrates experience synthesis for scalable stress testing and continual memory control to preserve long-horizon performance under bounded context.
  We present a complete system architecture, threat model, and security analysis, and provide a fully runnable reference implementation that demonstrates verifier-backed reward construction, skill compilation, audit logging, and measurable improvement under continual task streams. ASG-SI reframes agentic self-improvement as accumulation of verifiable, reusable capabilities, offering a practical path toward reproducible evaluation and operational governance of self-improving AI agents.

TL;DR: 本文引入针对大语言模型过生成攻击的基准测试，研究两种仅基于提示的攻击者，评估发现RL - GOAL攻击效果更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在过生成问题，现有研究多关注单一攻击算法或假设白盒访问，缺乏黑盒、仅查询机制下的攻击侧基准测试。

Method: 引入基准测试，研究两种攻击者：Evolutionary Over - Generation Prompt Search（EOGen）搜索抑制EOS的前缀；goal - conditioned reinforcement learning attacker（RL - GOAL）训练网络生成基于目标长度的前缀，引入Over - Generation Factor（OGF）等指标。

Result: 进化攻击者在Phi - 3上平均OGF为1.38 +/- 1.15，Success@OGF >= 2为24.5%；RL - GOAL更强，平均OGF最高达2.81 +/- 1.38。

Conclusion: RL - GOAL在引发大语言模型过生成方面表现更优。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be driven into over-generation, emitting thousands of tokens before producing an end-of-sequence (EOS) token. This degrades answer quality, inflates latency and cost, and can be weaponized as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Recent work has begun to study DoS-style prompt attacks, but typically focuses on a single attack algorithm or assumes white-box access, without an attack-side benchmark that compares prompt-based attackers in a black-box, query-only regime with a known tokenizer. We introduce such a benchmark and study two prompt-only attackers. The first is Evolutionary Over-Generation Prompt Search (EOGen), which searches the token space for prefixes that suppress EOS and induce long continuations. The second is a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning attacker (RL-GOAL) that trains a network to generate prefixes conditioned on a target length. To characterize behavior, we introduce Over-Generation Factor (OGF), the ratio of produced tokens to a model's context window, along with stall and latency summaries. Our evolutionary attacker achieves mean OGF = 1.38 +/- 1.15 and Success@OGF >= 2 of 24.5 percent on Phi-3. RL-GOAL is stronger: across victims it achieves higher mean OGF (up to 2.81 +/- 1.38).

Conclusion: MeLeMaD有潜力解决恶意软件检测中的鲁棒性、适应性和大规模高维数据集问题，为网络安全提供更有效解决方案。

Abstract: Confronting the substantial challenges of malware detection in cybersecurity necessitates solutions that are both robust and adaptable to the ever-evolving threat environment. The paper introduces Meta Learning Malware Detection (MeLeMaD), a novel framework leveraging the adaptability and generalization capabilities of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for malware detection. MeLeMaD incorporates a novel feature selection technique, Chunk-wise Feature Selection based on Gradient Boosting (CFSGB), tailored for handling large-scale, high-dimensional malware datasets, significantly enhancing the detection efficiency. Two benchmark malware datasets (CIC-AndMal2020 and BODMAS) and a custom dataset (EMBOD) were used for rigorously validating the MeLeMaD, achieving a remarkable performance in terms of key evaluation measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, MCC, and AUC. With accuracies of 98.04\% on CIC-AndMal2020 and 99.97\% on BODMAS, MeLeMaD outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The custom dataset, EMBOD, also achieves a commendable accuracy of 97.85\%. The results underscore the MeLeMaD's potential to address the challenges of robustness, adaptability, and large-scale, high-dimensional datasets in malware detection, paving the way for more effective and efficient cybersecurity solutions.

Result: 几乎所有评估的越狱技术能被至少一个安全过滤器检测，安全过滤器检测有效但需平衡召回和精确率。

Conclusion: 指出大语言模型安全系统检测准确性和可用性存在关键差距，呼吁改进。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed, ensuring their safe use is paramount. Jailbreaking, adversarial prompts that bypass model alignment to trigger harmful outputs, present significant risks, with existing studies reporting high success rates in evading common LLMs. However, previous evaluations have focused solely on the models, neglecting the full deployment pipeline, which typically incorporates additional safety mechanisms like content moderation filters. To address this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks targeting LLM safety alignment, assessing their success across the full inference pipeline, including both input and output filtering stages. Our findings yield two key insights: first, nearly all evaluated jailbreak techniques can be detected by at least one safety filter, suggesting that prior assessments may have overestimated the practical success of these attacks; second, while safety filters are effective in detection, there remains room to better balance recall and precision to further optimize protection and user experience. We highlight critical gaps and call for further refinement of detection accuracy and usability in LLM safety systems.

Method: 提出RepetitionCurse的低成本黑盒策略，用简单重复令牌模式以模型无关方式构建对抗性提示。

Result: 在Mixtral - 8x7B等模型上，该方法使端到端推理延迟增加3.063倍，显著降低服务可用性。

Conclusion: Mixture - of - Experts架构推理存在因路由集中导致的漏洞，RepetitionCurse策略可有效利用该漏洞。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts architectures have become the standard for scaling large language models due to their superior parameter efficiency. To accommodate the growing number of experts in practice, modern inference systems commonly adopt expert parallelism to distribute experts across devices. However, the absence of explicit load balancing constraints during inference allows adversarial inputs to trigger severe routing concentration. We demonstrate that out-of-distribution prompts can manipulate the routing strategy such that all tokens are consistently routed to the same set of top-$k$ experts, which creates computational bottlenecks on certain devices while forcing others to idle. This converts an efficiency mechanism into a denial-of-service attack vector, leading to violations of service-level agreements for time to first token. We propose RepetitionCurse, a low-cost black-box strategy to exploit this vulnerability. By identifying a universal flaw in MoE router behavior, RepetitionCurse constructs adversarial prompts using simple repetitive token patterns in a model-agnostic manner. On widely deployed MoE models like Mixtral-8x7B, our method increases end-to-end inference latency by 3.063x, degrading service availability significantly.

Result: SynRAG在跨SIEM威胁检测和事件调查中生成的查询明显优于现有基准模型。

Conclusion: SynRAG框架可实现跨异构SIEM环境的无缝威胁检测和事件调查，减少专业培训和手动查询翻译需求。

Abstract: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are essential for large enterprises to monitor their IT infrastructure by ingesting and analyzing millions of logs and events daily. Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models.

Conclusion: 该替代模型为等离子体边缘模拟提供了快速准确的方法，支持快速场景探索等，但在未训练物理区域需改进。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of scrape-off layer (SOL) and divertor-edge dynamics is vital for designing plasma-facing components in fusion devices. High-fidelity edge fluid/neutral codes such as SOLPS-ITER capture SOL physics with high accuracy, but their computational cost limits broad parameter scans and long transient studies. We present transformer-based, autoregressive surrogates for efficient prediction of 2D, time-dependent plasma edge state fields. Trained on SOLPS-ITER spatiotemporal data, the surrogates forecast electron temperature, electron density, and radiated power over extended horizons. We evaluate model variants trained with increasing autoregressive horizons (1-100 steps) on short- and long-horizon prediction tasks. Longer-horizon training systematically improves rollout stability and mitigates error accumulation, enabling stable predictions over hundreds to thousands of steps and reproducing key dynamical features such as the motion of high-radiation regions. Measured end-to-end wall-clock times show the surrogate is orders of magnitude faster than SOLPS-ITER, enabling rapid parameter exploration. Prediction accuracy degrades when the surrogate enters physical regimes not represented in the training dataset, motivating future work on data enrichment and physics-informed constraints. Overall, this approach provides a fast, accurate surrogate for computationally intensive plasma edge simulations, supporting rapid scenario exploration, control-oriented studies, and progress toward real-time applications in fusion devices.

Abstract: Audio-language models combine audio encoders with large language models to enable multimodal reasoning, but they also introduce new security vulnerabilities. We propose a universal targeted latent space attack, an encoder-level adversarial attack that manipulates audio latent representations to induce attacker-specified outputs in downstream language generation. Unlike prior waveform-level or input-specific attacks, our approach learns a universal perturbation that generalizes across inputs and speakers and does not require access to the language model. Experiments on Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct demonstrate consistently high attack success rates with minimal perceptual distortion, revealing a critical and previously underexplored attack surface at the encoder level of multimodal systems.

Abstract: Text-to-audio-video (T2AV) generation underpins a wide range of applications demanding realistic audio-visual content, including virtual reality, world modeling, gaming, and filmmaking. However, existing T2AV models remain incapable of generating physically plausible sounds, primarily due to their limited understanding of physical principles. To situate current research progress, we present PhyAVBench, a challenging audio physics-sensitivity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the audio physics grounding capabilities of existing T2AV models. PhyAVBench comprises 1,000 groups of paired text prompts with controlled physical variables that implicitly induce sound variations, enabling a fine-grained assessment of models' sensitivity to changes in underlying acoustic conditions. We term this evaluation paradigm the Audio-Physics Sensitivity Test (APST). Unlike prior benchmarks that primarily focus on audio-video synchronization, PhyAVBench explicitly evaluates models' understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying sound generation, covering 6 major audio physics dimensions, 4 daily scenarios (music, sound effects, speech, and their mix), and 50 fine-grained test points, ranging from fundamental aspects such as sound diffraction to more complex phenomena, e.g., Helmholtz resonance. Each test point consists of multiple groups of paired prompts, where each prompt is grounded by at least 20 newly recorded or collected real-world videos, thereby minimizing the risk of data leakage during model pre-training. Both prompts and videos are iteratively refined through rigorous human-involved error correction and quality control to ensure high quality. We argue that only models with a genuine grasp of audio-related physical principles can generate physically consistent audio-visual content. We hope PhyAVBench will stimulate future progress in this critical yet largely unexplored domain.

Abstract: Although Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) deliver state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, they frequently suffer from hallucinations, e.g. generating text not grounded in the audio input. We analyze these grounding failures and identify a distinct taxonomy: Event Omission, False Event Identity, Temporal Relation Error, and Quantitative Temporal Error. To address this, we introduce the AHA (Audio Hallucination Alignment) framework. By leveraging counterfactual hard negative mining, our pipeline constructs a high-quality preference dataset that forces models to distinguish strict acoustic evidence from linguistically plausible fabrications. Additionally, we establish AHA-Eval, a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously test these fine-grained temporal reasoning capabilities. We apply this data to align Qwen2.5-Omni. The resulting model, Qwen-Audio-AHA, achieves a 13.7% improvement on AHA-Eval. Crucially, this benefit generalizes beyond our diagnostic set. Our model shows substantial gains on public benchmarks, including 1.3% on MMAU-Test and 1.6% on MMAR, outperforming latest SOTA methods.

Abstract: Benign laryngeal voice disorders affect nearly one in five individuals and often manifest as dysphonia, while also serving as non-invasive indicators of broader physiological dysfunction. We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment. These results highlight the potential of quantitative voice biomarkers as scalable, non-invasive tools for early screening, diagnostic triage, and longitudinal monitoring of vocal health.

Abstract: Let the root of the word $w$ be the smallest prefix $v$ of $w$ such that $w$ is a prefix of $vvv...$. $per(w)$ is the length of the root of $w$. For any $n\ge5$, an $n$-ary threshold word is a word $w$ such that for any factor (subword) $v$ of $w$ the condition $\frac{|v|}{per(v)}\le\frac{n}{n-1}$ holds. Dejean conjecture (completely proven in 2009) states for $n\ge5$ that exists infinitely many of $n$-ary TWs.
  This manuscript is based on the author's student works (diplomas of 2011 (bachelor's thesis) and 2013 (master's thesis) years) and presents an edited version (in Russian) of these works with some improvements.
  In a 2011 work proposed new methods of proving of the Dejean conjecture for some odd cases $n\ge5$, using computer verification in polynomial time (depending on $n$). Moreover, the constructed threshold words (TWs) are ciclic/ring TWs (any cyclic shift is a TW).
  In the 2013 work, the proof method (of 2011) was improved by reducing the verification conditions. A solution for some even cases $n\ge6$ is also proposed. A 2013 work also proposed a method to construct stronger TWs, using a TW tree with regular exponential growth. Namely, the TWs, where all long factors have an exponent close to 1.
