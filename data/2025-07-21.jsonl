The goal is to produce an $\\alpha$-MMS allocation at\nthe end. Several recent works have investigated this model, but have only\nsucceeded in obtaining non-trivial algorithms under restrictive assumptions,\nsuch as the two-agent bi-valued special case (Wang and Wei, 2025), or by\nassuming knowledge of the total disutility of each agent (Zhou, Bai, and Wu,\n2023). For the general case, the trivial $n$-MMS guarantee remains the best\nknown, while the strongest lower bound is still only $2$.\n  We close this gap on the negative side by proving that for any fixed $n$ and\n$\\varepsilon$, no algorithm can guarantee an $(n - \\varepsilon)$-MMS\nallocation. Notably, this lower bound holds precisely for every $n$, without\nhiding constants in big-$O$ notation, thereby exactly matching the trivial\nupper bound.\n  Despite this strong impossibility result, we also present positive results.\nWe provide an online algorithm that applies in the general case, guaranteeing a\n$\\min\\{n, O(k), O(\\log D)\\}$-MMS allocation, where $k$ is the maximum number of\ndistinct disutilities across all agents and $D$ is the maximum ratio between\nthe largest and smallest disutilities for any agent. This bound is reasonable\nacross a broad range of scenarios and, for example, implies that we can achieve\nan $O(1)$-MMS allocation whenever $k$ is constant. Moreover, to optimize the\nconstant in the important personalized bi-valued case, we show that if each\nagent has at most two distinct disutilities, our algorithm guarantees a $(2 +\n\\sqrt{3}) \\approx 3.7$-MMS allocation."}

The traditional\napproach to checkpointing requires a pause in training to copy model states to\na separate location, allowing the state to be restored in the event of failure.\nThis approach fundamentally has a tradeoff between the frequency of checkpoints\nand the cost of a failure. We avoid this tradeoff; our key insight is that in\ndata-parallel training, all information necessary to create a checkpoint\nalready exists in the network as gradients. Our core contribution is a new\nmulticast abstraction that simultaneously delivers gradients to a separate\nCPU-based shadow cluster. The shadow maintains a checkpoint by applying those\ngradients to a copy of the model.

To eliminate temporal\nambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units\n(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal\nanchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture\ntemporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event\ngraph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting\nefficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent\ngeneration, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that\nretrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time\nChain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This\nunified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event\nsequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG\nsystems cannot resolve.

Despite their instructional relevance, these samples are\noften governed informally, with minimal review and unclear ownership, which\nincreases their exposure to socio-technical degradation. In this context, the\nco-occurrence and longitudinal interplay of code smells (e.g., large classes,\npoor modularity) and community smells (e.g., lone contributors, fragmented\ncommunication) become particularly critical. While each type of smell has been\nstudied in isolation, little is known about how community-level dysfunctions\nanticipate or exacerbate technical anomalies in code samples over time. This\nstudy investigates how code and community smells emerge, co-occur, and evolve\nwithin code samples maintained in OSSECOs.

In this paper, we introduce\nMorphoNAS (Morphogenetic Neural Architecture Search), a system able to\ndeterministically grow neural networks through morphogenetic self-organization\ninspired by the Free Energy Principle, reaction-diffusion systems, and gene\nregulatory networks. In MorphoNAS, simple genomes encode just morphogens\ndynamics and threshold-based rules of cellular development. Nevertheless, this\nleads to self-organization of a single progenitor cell into complex neural\nnetworks, while the entire process is built on local chemical interactions. Our\nevolutionary experiments focused on two different domains: structural\ntargeting, in which MorphoNAS system was able to find fully successful genomes\nable to generate predefined random graph configurations (8-31 nodes); and\nfunctional performance on the CartPole control task achieving low complexity\n6-7 neuron solutions when target network size minimization evolutionary\npressure was applied. The evolutionary process successfully balanced between\nquality of of the final solutions and neural architecture search effectiveness.\nOverall, our findings suggest that the proposed MorphoNAS method is able to\ngrow complex specific neural architectures, using simple developmental rules,\nwhich suggests a feasible biological route to adaptive and efficient neural\narchitecture search."}

Feature requests,\ntypically expressed in natural language, often suffer from ambiguity or\nincomplete information due to communication gaps or the requester's limited\ntechnical expertise. These issues can lead to misinterpretation, faulty\nimplementation, and reduced software quality. While seeking clarification from\nrequesters is a common strategy to mitigate these risks, little is known about\nhow developers engage in this clarification process in practice-how they\nformulate clarifying questions, seek technical or contextual details, align on\ngoals and use cases, or decide to close requests without attempting\nclarification. This study investigates how feature requests are prone to NL\ndefects (i.e. ambiguous or incomplete) and the conversational dynamics of\nclarification in open-source software (OSS) development, aiming to understand\nhow developers handle ambiguous or incomplete feature requests. Our findings\nsuggest that feature requests published on the OSS platforms do possess\nambiguity and incompleteness, and in some cases, both. We also find that\nexplicit clarification for the resolution of these defects is uncommon;\ndevelopers usually focus on aligning with project goals rather than resolving\nunclear text. When clarification occurs, it emphasizes understanding user\nintent/goal and feasibility, rather than technical details. By characterizing\nthe dynamics of clarification in open-source issue trackers, this work\nidentifies patterns that can improve user-developer collaboration and inform\nbest practices for handling feature requests effectively."}

This paper attempts to address this problem by exploring two\ncomplementary aspects.\n  First, it proposes a framework for comparing existing test methods in terms\nof their intrinsic effectiveness and validity. It shows that many methods do\nnot meet both of these requirements. Either because they are based on criteria\nthat do not allow for rapid, inexpensive, and comprehensive detection of\nfailures, or because the degree of validity of the properties tested cannot be\naccurately estimated. In particular, it is shown that most critical test\nmethods do not take into account the nominal operational capabilities of\nautopilots and generate scenarios that are impossible for the tested vehicles\nto handle, resulting in unjustified rejections.\n  Secondly, the paper shows that test effectiveness and validity are highly\ndependent on how autopilots are designed: how they choose between different\ncontrol policies to perform maneuvers, as well as on the reproducibility of the\nresults. In fact, most test methods take for granted two principles underlying\ntraditional methods, but do not generally apply to ADS. We maintain that the\nabsence of rationality and determinacy significantly impairs the effectiveness\nand validity of test methods, and provide test results on eight open\nautopilots, in which most do not satisfy these properties, thereby illustrating\nthis fact.\n  We conclude that under the current state of the art, it is impossible to\nobtain strong enough guarantees for essential autopilot properties and\nrecommend that autopilots be developed with a view to both rationality and\ndeterminacy."}

However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have\nno control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already\nincluded in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that\nevaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a\nnatural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL\ngeneration, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with \"anonymized\" knowledge\ninjection.

This\nadaptivity yields up to 20\\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without\nincreasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test\ntime offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget.\nSelf-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative\nreasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures."}

However, in many real-world applications, data are\nhigh-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of\nirregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is\ncritical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.\nIn this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the\ntransformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set\nof latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that\nintegrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks\nusing the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and\nextracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design\nto enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm\nconverges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in\ntheoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic\nhealth record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both\nphenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability\nof causal representations."}

In this work,\nwe address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure\nobjective based \\emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation\noutputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for\ndifferentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all\ngeneration steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to\nshow theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the\nrobustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to\nmodel fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching\nmodels demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading\noverall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible\ngenerative models."}

We introduce Masking-Augmented\nDiffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the\neditability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through\ntwo core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion\n(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines\nstandard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy\ninput from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative\nand compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and\nstructure-aware editing.

However,\neffective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of\ndeformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an\nopen issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact\nor, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact\nplanes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that\nserve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions\nfor detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture\nthat utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time,\nincorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable\nbodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft\ntissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic\nvalve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the\nloss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits\nhold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and\ncomplex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also\ndemonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries.\nHowever, such benefits come with high computational costs during training,\nresulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the\ntraining cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware\narchitectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in\nup to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference."}

This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of\nthe training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will\nhelp to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly\nbe achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.\nLLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any\nknowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM,\ns.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is\npossible."}

The primacy effect-where items presented first are\nmore likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice\nQuestion Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect\nprediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We\nfirst show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to\nhuman-like patterns.

In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge.

Possessing awareness of event memorability for a\nuser could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially\nfor such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and\nmeeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since\nemotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The\nemotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally\nbeen considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced\nas highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This\nrelationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for\nmemorability.
