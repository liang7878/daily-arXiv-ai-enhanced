Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we\nintroduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture\nincorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity\nand sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms.

Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the\npotential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model\ndiversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We\ndemonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating\na disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,\nevaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We\nintroduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively\nevaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and\nclinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While\nthe use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the\nchallenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the\nimportance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for\ninaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations\nfor future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided\nsynthetic data creation."}

CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time\nconsumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent\nservice costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process,\nsignificantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it\ndifficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often\nresulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nknowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively\ncorrelated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are\nintroduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided\ninitialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial\nsolutions to speed up convergence. Second, a knowledge-guided small-step-size\nlocal search strategy (KGSLSS) is proposed to filter out invalid moves, thereby\nreducing unnecessary evaluations and saving the computation time. Experimental\nresults on five benchmark test sets, including both small- and larger-scale\ninstances, demonstrate that KGMA-GN achieves higher search efficiency than the\nstate-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study further confirms that\nthe knowledge-guided local search operators in KGSLSS can significantly reduce\nruntime compared to traditional operators, especially for the knowledge-guided\nswap operator, which achieves more than a tenfold improvement in speed."}

This non-parametric result, which follows from fundamental\nproperties of order statistics, holds regardless of the underlying\ndistribution's shape. This equal-probability partition yields a discrete\nentropy of $\\log_2(N+1)$ bits, which quantifies the information gained from the\nsample and contrasts with Shannon's results for continuous variables.

However,\nit introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between\ndifferent PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection\ntools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language\nmodels (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language\ncode identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL\ncombinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction\ntypes. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their\nperformance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and\ncode comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before\nfine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after\nfine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407).

Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for\ninvestigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are\nactually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying\ndifficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for\nverbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order\nto test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given\nthat they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to\nwhat degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they\n\"understand\" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different\nsizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as\nfine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades\nfrom $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the\nsamples optimized on.

Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple\nIMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents\ndifferent business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on\nmultiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes\nvarious IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two\nprimary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA\nobjectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in\nresource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We\npartition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to\nfacilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning\nprocedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking\nphases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better\nadaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second\nchallenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the\ntraining procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and\ncommunication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on\nthree benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and\nContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world\nwireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.\nWe will release our code to the community."}

In this work, we\nintroduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual\ndecision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves\nthis through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which\nbridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a\nprototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages\nability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual\nembeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can\naccurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high\nfidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior\nmodeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in\nchess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,\nrepresenting a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an\nexample of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users\nusing a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond\nchess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its\npotential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation."}

In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying\nthese methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while\ndirectly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper\npersonalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we\npropose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to\nstore embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to\nstore class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each\nclient retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's\ncoordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both\nembedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution\nclients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients.

The goal of this paper is to unravel these\nissues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a\nline of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.\nthe fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we\nanalyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of\nclassification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are\nequivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying\nthe properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their\nboundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By\nparameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that\nthey satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be\nused to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.\nMoreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the\nmulticlass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the\nclass assignments.

While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead\ndue to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.\nExisting acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early\nstopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via\nspeculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers\nfrom limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,\nand fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing\nconcise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a\ntoken-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT\ninference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large\nlanguage model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to\ngenerate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's\nconfidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback\nand selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency\nand answer quality.

In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged\nto tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of\nLLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation,\nillustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment,\nand interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision.\nLLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate\neffectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external\nknowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven\narchitectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of\nconventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for\nunderstanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the\ntrade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance. Our goal\nis to demonstrate that LLMs are not merely auxiliary components but\nfoundational enablers for building more adaptive, semantically rich, and\nuser-centric recommender systems"}

Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we\nintroduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture\nincorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity\nand sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models\nmemory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving\ntransparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We\nevaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit\nclassification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language\nmodeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and\ngeneralization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM\narchitectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on\nthe large-scale WikiText-103 task.

Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both\nvision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from\nlarge language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems\nconverge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared,\nembedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a\nspace manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three\nparticipants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100\nnatural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural\nScenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not\nonly converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar\nnetwork of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images.\nFurthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings\noutperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the\nbehavioural similarity structure.

In contrast to existing approaches that rely on\nmultiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes\nvarious IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two\nprimary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA\nobjectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in\nresource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph.

Staining, also known as\nwatermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to\nidentify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret\ntrigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms\ncan be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning\nor retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their\nworst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly\nmodifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the\n(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small\n`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental\nresults showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical\nperformance on a variety of computer vision models."}

As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks\nin mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model\nintelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally\ninvolved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of\nconnections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural\nreferences, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately\n300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and\nCartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying\nessential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards\nthe humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on\nthis task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between\nconcepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at\nthe most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA\nmodels reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers\neffectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM\nreasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong\ntransferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing\nthinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor\nreasoning."}

These synthetic preferences are\nthen used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,\nsimilar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally\ncurated rewards.\n  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --\nrestoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step\nreasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and\nmultiple-choice question answering.\n  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms\nreinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and\ndata-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further\nresearch in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training."}
