### [1] [Majority Rules: LLM Ensemble is a Winning Approach for Content Categorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15714)
*Ariel Kamen,Yakov Kamen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出用于非结构化文本分类的集成大语言模型框架eLLM，性能提升显著，接近人类专家水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单个大语言模型在非结构化文本分类中存在的不一致、幻觉、类别膨胀和错误分类等问题。

Method: 集成多个大语言模型，通过集体决策的数学模型形式化集成过程并建立聚合标准，在相同零样本条件下对十个最先进的大语言模型进行评估。

Result: eLLM的F1分数比最强的单个模型提高达65%，单个模型因语义丰富文本压缩为稀疏分类表示而性能达到平台期，eLLM提高了鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: eLLM提供了可扩展且可靠的基于分类法的分类解决方案，可显著减少对人类专家标注的依赖。

Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble framework for unstructured text categorization using large language models (LLMs). By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy. With a diverse consortium of models, eLLM achieves near human-expert-level performance, offering a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that may significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling.

### [2] [Graph-Memoized Reasoning: Foundations Structured Workflow Reuse in Intelligent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15715)
*Yash Raj Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 针对大语言模型推理系统计算资源浪费等问题，提出Graph - Memoized Reasoning框架进行推理工作流的存储和复用，并制定优化目标和评估协议，为高效推理架构奠基。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代基于大语言模型的推理系统存在重复计算问题，浪费资源、增加延迟和限制可重复性，需要持久推理机制。

Method: 引入Graph - Memoized Reasoning框架，将推理工作流表示为图结构记忆，通过结构和语义相似性检索决策图，制定优化目标和评估协议。

Result: 建立了可解释、成本高效和自我改进的推理架构基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模智能体系统的持久记忆迈出了一步。

Abstract: Modern large language model-based reasoning systems frequently recompute similar reasoning steps across tasks, wasting computational resources, inflating inference latency, and limiting reproducibility. These inefficiencies underscore the need for persistent reasoning mechanisms that can recall and reuse prior computational traces.
  We introduce Graph-Memoized Reasoning, a formal framework for representing, storing, and reusing reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory. By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.
  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.
  This framework establishes the groundwork for interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-improving reasoning architectures, offering a step toward persistent memory in large-scale agentic systems.

### [3] [Trustworthy AI in the Agentic Lakehouse: from Concurrency to Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16402)
*Jacopo Tagliabue,Federico Bianchi,Ciro Greco*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 多数企业认为AI代理处理生产数据不可信，本文提出从解决基础设施问题入手实现可信代理工作流，提出Bauplan设计并给出参考实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多数企业认为AI代理处理生产数据不可信的问题，从解决基础设施问题开始实现可信代理工作流。

Method: 类比数据库中的MVCC，指出其在解耦、多语言环境移植失败的原因，提出agent - first设计Bauplan，重新实现数据和计算隔离。

Result: 提出了Bauplan设计，并给出了在Bauplan中自修复管道的参考实现。

Conclusion: 通过Bauplan可将代理推理与正确性和信任的期望保证无缝结合。

Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

### [4] [MACIE: Multi-Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer for Collective Behavior Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15716)
*Abraham Itzhak Weinberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MACIE框架为多智能体强化学习系统提供全面解释，经四个场景评估效果良好，迈向可解释多智能体AI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习用于安全关键应用，现有可解释AI方法在多智能体场景有局限，需理解智能体决策原因和集体行为实现方式。

Method: 提出MACIE框架，结合结构因果模型、干预反事实和Shapley值，通过干预归因分数分析个体因果贡献，用协同指标量化系统涌现智能，用自然语言合成因果洞察提供可操作解释。

Result: 在四个多智能体强化学习场景评估，结果显示结果归因准确，能检测合作任务积极涌现，计算高效。

Conclusion: MACIE结合因果严谨性、涌现量化和多智能体支持，迈向可解释、可信和可问责的多智能体AI。

Abstract: As Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning systems are used in safety critical applications. Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU. MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi agent support while remaining practical for real time use. This represents a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi agent AI.

### [5] [How Modality Shapes Perception and Reasoning: A Study of Error Propagation in ARC-AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15717)
*Bo Wen,Chen Wang,Erhan Bilal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究ARC - AGI和ARC - AGI - 2在小颜色量化网格上的泛化能力，分析不同模态对网格特征感知的影响，发现结合文本和图像可提升执行效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对编码如何塑造模型感知以及如何区分指令错误和执行错误的原则性解释，假设模态会造成感知瓶颈。

Method: 使用加权集分歧度量和两阶段推理管道，在九种文本和图像模态中分离感知和推理。

Result: 结构化文本能给出稀疏特征的精确坐标，图像能捕捉二维形状但对分辨率敏感，结合两者可提高执行效果。

Conclusion: 使表征与Transformer归纳偏置对齐，实现文本和图像的交叉验证，可在不改变基础模型的情况下提高指令准确性和执行可靠性。

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

### [6] [ToolMind Technical Report: A Large-Scale, Reasoning-Enhanced Tool-Use Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15718)
*Chen Yang,Ran Le,Yun Xing,Zhenwei An,Zongchao Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Yang Song,Tao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型（LLM）智能体高质量轨迹稀缺，为此引入ToolMind数据集，采用新的数据合成与筛选方法，微调模型在基准测试中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM智能体高质量轨迹稀缺，以及多轮对话合成仅在轨迹层面验证正确性，忽略轮次错误影响模型性能的问题。

Method: 构建ToolMind数据集，先基于参数相关性构建函数图，再用多智能体框架模拟交互，采用细粒度轮次级过滤去除错误或次优步骤。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，基于ToolMind微调的模型相比基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和方法能缓解训练中的错误放大问题，保留自纠正推理信号，利于健壮的工具使用学习。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have developed rapidly in recent years to solve complex real-world problems using external tools. However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning. Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

### [7] [Artificial Intelligence and Accounting Research: A Framework and Agenda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16055)
*Theophanis C. Stratopoulos,Victor Xiaoqi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出AI - 会计研究框架，应用于相关论文以识别研究机会，分析研究者优势，探讨GenAI和LLMs对研究过程的影响，呼吁博士教育改革。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能发展给会计研究带来机遇和威胁，需梳理研究并探索应对方法。

Method: 提出基于研究焦点和方法论途径两个维度的框架，应用于特刊论文和顶级期刊研究。

Result: 发现GenAI使研究能力大众化，加剧竞争，人类判断、创造力和理论深度仍有价值。

Conclusion: 需要改革博士教育，培养比较优势并提升AI能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.

### [8] [Chain of Summaries: Summarization Through Iterative Questioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15719)
*William Brach,Lukas Galke Poech*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Chain of Summaries (CoS)方法生成通用、信息密集的网页内容摘要，实验表明CoS优于基线和专业摘要方法，是使网页内容更易被大语言模型访问的有吸引力选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型难以消化网页内容，因格式不友好和上下文长度限制的问题。

Method: 受黑格尔辩证法启发，提出CoS方法，通过迭代改进初始摘要，识别其局限性生成通用摘要。

Result: 在TriviaQA、TruthfulQA和SQUAD数据集上，CoS比零样本大语言模型基线高66%，比BRIO和PEGASUS等专业摘要方法高27%，生成摘要问答性能更好，所需令牌更少且与下游大语言模型无关。

Conclusion: CoS是网站维护者使内容更易被大语言模型访问的有吸引力选择，且保留人工监督可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的自动化算法设计进展虽快但不透明，缺乏对算法工作原理等的解释，需要耦合自动化与系统基准测试的理解。

Method: 提出可解释的自动化算法设计愿景，包含LLM驱动的算法变体发现、可解释的基准测试、连接算法行为与景观结构的问题类描述符三个支柱。

Result: 形成了一个发现、解释和泛化相互强化的封闭知识循环。

Conclusion: 这种集成将使该领域从盲目搜索转向可解释的、特定类别的算法设计，加速进展并产生可复用的科学见解。

Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

Motivation: 建筑工地事故数据格式多样，传统方法难以综合分析隐患，需要新方法解决。

Method: 提出多模态AI框架，进行两个案例研究，一是用GPT 4o和GPT 4o mini从事故报告提取信息，二是用Molmo 7B和Qwen2 VL 2B在公开数据集上检测违规。

Result: Molmo 7B和Qwen2 VL 2B虽模型小，但在特定提示配置下有有竞争力的表现。

Conclusion: 低资源多模态系统用于规则感知安全监控是可行的。

Abstract: This thesis explores a multimodal AI framework for enhancing construction safety through the combined analysis of textual and visual data. In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, which requires ability to perceive and manipulate spatial relationships in the 3D world, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, yet remains a persistent challenge for Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在特定领域应用因知识差距效果不佳，处理复杂多步推理问题性能下降，需开发教育助手提升本科生物力学课程学习效果。

Method: 构建双模块框架，用检索增强生成（RAG）提升概念判断题回答效果，构建多智能体系统（MAS）解决计算类多步推理问题，评估多个大语言模型在生物力学数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: 应用RAG和MAS提升大语言模型在工程专业课程中的表现具有潜力，为工程教育智能辅导提供了方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单智能体方法在基于大语言模型的生产系统事件响应中生成的建议模糊、不可用，需要改进。

Method: 构建MyAntFarm.ai框架，进行348次受控试验，对比单智能体和多智能体系统在相同事件场景下的表现，引入决策质量（DQ）指标。

Result: 多智能体编排可实现100%的可操作建议率，行动特异性提高80倍，解决方案正确性提高140倍，且质量无差异；两种架构理解延迟相似。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排从性能优化转变为基于大语言模型的事件响应的生产就绪要求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.

Conclusion: 该研究成果弥合了当前AI治理现状与关键应用中AI可操作风险评估和管理迫切需求之间的差距。

Abstract: Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.
  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to "consider the right questions" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.

Motivation: 在非英语医疗环境中，利用NLP从非结构化临床文本中提取结构化医疗见解是挑战，需比较不同NLP方法。

Method: 对比基于规则的低计算NLP方法和LLMs从电子健康记录中提取患者人口统计信息、临床发现和处方药物，考察文本未归一化和翻译信息损失的影响。

Result: 基于规则的方法在信息检索任务中准确性更高，LLMs适应性和可扩展性更强，在药物名称识别上表现出色。

Conclusion: 在医疗环境中部署NLP时要权衡准确性、归一化和计算成本，建议采用结合规则系统精度和LLMs适应性的混合方法。

Abstract: Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.

Result: IMACT - CXR展示出有界延迟的响应式辅导流程，能精确控制答案泄露，具有扩展性，初步评估显示在定位和诊断推理上优于基线。

Conclusion: IMACT - CXR在辅助学员解读胸片方面有较好表现和应用潜力。

Abstract: IMACT-CXR is an interactive multi-agent conversational tutor that helps trainees interpret chest X-rays by unifying spatial annotation, gaze analysis, knowledge retrieval, and image-grounded reasoning in a single AutoGen-based workflow. The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, current systems struggle with the interconnected challenges that define real-world decision making. Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making. Code: https://github.com/Skyfall-Research/MAPs

Conclusion: 推理能力在合适锚定下跨模态可迁移，Step - Audio - R1为构建多模态推理系统开辟新途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

Abstract: Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.

Motivation: 现有研究虽表明激活引导可提升语言模型的ToM能力，但内部变化机制不明，需进一步研究。

Method: 用线性探针比较引导和基线大语言模型的激活，对Gemma - 3 - 4B应用对比激活添加（CAA）引导，并在1000个BigToM前向信念场景中评估。

Result: 信念归因任务准确率从32.5%提升到46.7%，情感内容处理激活增强，分析过程被抑制。

Conclusion: 大语言模型成功的ToM能力由情感理解介导，而非分析推理。

Abstract: Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.

Result: 框架生成的电路面积和功耗效率显著优于传统HLS设计，接近人工设计电路质量，且保持了HDL实现的正确性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效，展示了利用大语言模型生成能力和传统IC设计流程严谨性进行HDL设计的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

Conclusion: 该框架能让模型更具自省能力，改善生成行为，提升中间推理步骤的连贯性和忠实性。

Abstract: This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.

Conclusion: 多智能体小语言模型系统在判断任务中可能超越大语言模型，对可扩展高效评估有意义。

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

Result: KRAL显著优于传统RAG和SFT方法，提高知识问答和推理能力，且长期训练成本约为SFT的20%。

Conclusion: KRAL是提升本地大语言模型临床诊断能力的有效方案，可实现低成本、高安全性部署。

Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.

Conclusion: 基于嵌入的检测可有效识别欺骗性模型行为，且不牺牲部署效率，解决了AI部署中的关键安全缺口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as "sleeper agents." Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

Result: 即使提供权威段落，模型回答仍存在错误，检索增强生成 (RAG) 可约束输出。

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

Through keyword detection and semantic parsing, the system dynamically triggers data visualizations and audiovisual playback based on time, location, and thematic cues drawn from the dialogue. Developed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure and inspired by the eco-aesthetic philosophy of Newton Harrison, Sensorium Arc reimagines ocean data not as an abstract dataset but as a living narrative. The project demonstrates the potential of conversational AI agents to mediate affective, intuitive access to high-dimensional environmental data and proposes a new paradigm for human-machine-ecosystem.

Abstract: Digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector has produced vast yet fragmented collections of artefact data. Existing frameworks for museum information systems struggle to integrate heterogeneous metadata, unstructured documents, and multimodal artefacts into a coherent and queryable form. We present MuseKG, an end-to-end knowledge-graph framework that unifies structured and unstructured museum data through symbolic-neural integration. MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines. The results highlight the importance of symbolic grounding for interpretable and scalable cultural heritage reasoning, and pave the way for web-scale integration of digital heritage knowledge.

Abstract: Introduction: The application of Artificial Intelligence in games has evolved significantly, allowing for dynamic content generation.

Objective: This paper proposes SpellForger, a game where players create custom spells by writing natural language prompts, aiming to provide a unique experience of personalization and creativity.

The game is developed in the Unity Game Engine, and the AI backend is in Python. Expected Results: We expect to deliver a functional prototype that demonstrates the generation of spells in real time, applied to an engaging gameplay loop, where player creativity is central to the experience, validating the use of AI as a direct gameplay mechanic.

*Jorge A. Huertas,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的约束规划模型用于串行批次调度问题，不依赖虚拟批次集，经改进后在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有考虑最小批次大小的串行批次调度的约束规划模型依赖预定义虚拟批次集，存在维度灾难和复杂性问题。

Method: 提出不依赖虚拟批次集的新约束规划模型，利用关键对齐参数，通过定制搜索阶段和加强约束传播器推理水平改进模型。

Result: 在近五千个实例上实验，新模型在中小规模（最多100个作业）实例上表现优越，在大规模（最多500个作业、10个族、10台机器）实例上找到的解比现有方法好达25%。

Conclusion: 新的约束规划模型在串行批次调度问题上优于现有方法。

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.

Motivation: 传统云边工作负载资源管理过于被动，依赖静态阈值会导致资源过度使用或性能下降，因此寻求主动式解决方案。

Method: 设计混合架构，结合CNN LSTM进行时间序列预测和基于多智能体深度强化学习的编排器，将CNN LSTM的预测结果嵌入DRL智能体状态空间。

Result: 测试表明该系统轻松击败旧方法，擅长解决复杂决策和兼顾多目标问题。

Conclusion: 该主动式解决方案能找到资源使用和系统性能的平衡点，实现平稳高效运行。

Abstract: Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

Motivation: 开发高效、多轮、长周期智能体训练和评估框架，提升智能体性能和训练效率。

Method: 引入SkyRL - Agent框架，有高效异步调度等特性；训练SA - SWE - 32B时采用优化异步管道调度器和工具增强训练配方。

Result: SA - SWE - 32B在SWE - Bench Verified上Pass@1达39.4%，成本降低超2倍，能有效泛化到其他任务；展示SkyRL - Agent扩展性。

Conclusion: SkyRL - Agent框架有效，能提升智能体训练效率和性能，训练的智能体有良好泛化能力和扩展性。

Abstract: We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.
  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.

Motivation: 大语言模型融入医疗实践存在对齐挑战，如评估基准与临床需求脱节、难适应医疗标准、传统奖励模型无法捕捉医疗质量标准，限制其临床实用性。

Method: 提出MR - RML框架，通过GPRC将医疗标准整合到“维度 - 场景 - 学科”矩阵，包括构建医疗标准系统、独立多维奖励模型和几何投影参考约束。

Result: 在Healthbench基准测试中，相比基础大模型Qwen - 32B有显著性能提升，在开源大模型中达到SOTA，还优于多数闭源模型。

Conclusion: MR - RML框架有效解决大语言模型在医疗实践中的对齐问题，提升其临床实用性。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.

Method: 引入FOOTPASS数据集，开发利用计算机视觉任务输出和足球先验知识的以球员为中心的动作识别方法。

Result: 得到可用于数据驱动体育分析的可靠逐球数据流。

Conclusion: FOOTPASS数据集有助于开发相关方法生成可靠逐球数据，为体育分析提供重要输入。

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

Motivation: 传统奖励模型难以联合优化多偏好维度且缺乏透明度，需要改进。

Method: 将偏好评估分解为特定领域的代理产生部分信号，结合全局评估器，用集中聚合器融合信号，通过基于优势的更新优化策略，价值模型回归聚合奖励。

Result: CRM框架和rewardBench为更透明的奖励建模和更稳定的优化提供了实用、模块化的途径。

Conclusion: CRM和rewardBench能解决传统奖励模型问题，实现更优的奖励建模和优化。

Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.

Abstract: Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

Conclusion: LHRL框架有效协调长期公平和短期效用，具有泛化性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.

Result: 在MuISQA基准和其他通用RAG数据集上实验，该方法在检索准确性和证据覆盖方面始终优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的意图感知检索框架能有效提升RAG系统在多意图科学问答中的表现。

Abstract: Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

Conclusion: 指出该工作凸显了架构模式、隐私考量和通信流程，为分布式多智能体系统更严格评估和未来研究指明机会。

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和发布的数据集能更好支持金融治理和决策中的ESG整合。

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

Result: 通过五个例子展示了神经科学从机器学习研究中可借鉴的内容。

Conclusion: 强调了深入研究生成式AI生成原则对认知神经科学的必要性，以及神经科学能从机器学习研究中受益。

Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

Motivation: 多数计算工具未设计用于跟踪痴呆症患者日常交流行为随时间的变化，因此需要一个评估检测方法的基准。

Method: 基于对护理人员的访谈，模拟60天合成用户交互日志，设计PersonaDrift基准，评估多种异常检测方法。

Conclusion: 强调了个体行为背景对检测痴呆症患者交流行为变化的重要性。

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.

Result: CLOZE是准确、可扩展且保护隐私的本体扩展框架。

Conclusion: CLOZE有潜力支持生物医学研究和临床信息学的下游应用。

Abstract: Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.

Abstract: We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.

Conclusion: 所提方法结合了基于案例推理模型的内在可解释性和形式XAI的保证。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

Method: 提出D - GARA框架，引入多种真实异常，构建并标注含异常的安卓应用基准。

Result: 实验表明，现有先进的GUI代理在异常丰富环境中性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: 有必要进行鲁棒性感知学习，D - GARA框架模块化、可扩展，能满足特定评估目标。

Abstract: Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型作为评判器的方法存在权衡问题，如输出单一分数与模型生成特性不符，自回归生成评判分析在高吞吐量场景下速度慢。

Method: 提出YOFO，一种模板条件方法，基于自回归模型，接受结构化需求模板，在一次推理中通过读取与需求关联的最终标记的对数几率来为每个需求生成二进制是/否决策。

Result: 在标准推荐数据集上达到了最先进的结果，支持依赖感知分析，还能从事后思维链中受益。

Conclusion: YOFO方法在解决多模态大语言模型评判问题上有效，能实现数量级的速度提升且保留可解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.

Conclusion: 开源模型和代码，提供缓解数据和资源瓶颈的系统框架，助社区高效构建具身智能体。

Abstract: Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.

Motivation: Transformer在临床决策支持中易过度自信，尤其在模糊医疗场景中，需要校准不确定性。

Method: 将不确定性量化嵌入现有Transformer管道，集成贝叶斯嵌入校准、不确定性加权注意力和置信度引导决策塑造三个组件。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，减少32 - 48%的过度自信；在模拟临床环境中，可预防41%的诊断错误。

Conclusion: MedBayes - Lite能有效实现可靠的不确定性传播，提高医疗AI系统的可解释性。

Abstract: We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.

The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk. The study concludes with a comparative analysis to determine which class of input features, fundamental or technical, provides greater and more reliable predictive capacity for generating profitable trading signals.

Abstract: Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.

Abstract: Persistent cost and schedule overruns in U.S. building projects expose limitations of conventional, document-based estimating and deterministic Critical Path Method (CPM) scheduling, which remain inflexible under uncertainty and lag dynamic field conditions. This study presents an integrated 4D/5D digital-twin framework unifying Building Information Modeling (BIM), natural language processing (NLP), reality capture, computer vision, Bayesian risk modeling, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for construction cost and schedule control. The system automates project-control functions by: (a) mapping contract documents to standardized cost items using transformer-based NLP (0.883 weighted F1 score); (b) aligning photogrammetry and LiDAR data with BIM to compute earned value; (c) deriving real-time activity completion from site imagery (0.891 micro accuracy); (d) updating probabilistic CPM forecasts via Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo simulation; (e) using DRL for adaptive resource allocation (75% adoption rate); and (f) providing 4D/5D decision sandbox for predictive analysis. A Texas mid-rise case study demonstrates localized cost adjustment using RSMeans City Cost Index and Bureau of Labor Statistics wage data. Results show 43% reduction in estimating labor, 6% overtime reduction (91 hours), and project completion matching P50 probabilistic forecast of 128 days, confirming improved estimation accuracy and responsiveness.

Abstract: Underground pipeline leaks and infiltrations pose significant threats to water security and environmental safety. Traditional manual inspection methods provide limited coverage and delayed response, often missing critical anomalies. This paper proposes AquaSentinel, a novel physics-informed AI system for real-time anomaly detection in urban underground water pipeline networks. We introduce four key innovations: (1) strategic sparse sensor deployment at high-centrality nodes combined with physics-based state augmentation to achieve network-wide observability from minimal infrastructure; (2) the RTCA (Real-Time Cumulative Anomaly) detection algorithm, which employs dual-threshold monitoring with adaptive statistics to distinguish transient fluctuations from genuine anomalies; (3) a Mixture of Experts (MoE) ensemble of spatiotemporal graph neural networks that provides robust predictions by dynamically weighting model contributions; (4) causal flow-based leak localization that traces anomalies upstream to identify source nodes and affected pipe segments. Our system strategically deploys sensors at critical network junctions and leverages physics-based modeling to propagate measurements to unmonitored nodes, creating virtual sensors that enhance data availability across the entire network. Experimental evaluation using 110 leak scenarios demonstrates that AquaSentinel achieves 100% detection accuracy. This work advances pipeline monitoring by demonstrating that physics-informed sparse sensing can match the performance of dense deployments at a fraction of the cost, providing a practical solution for aging urban infrastructure.

Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are essential for monitoring and communication in complex environments, where coverage optimization directly affects performance and energy efficiency. However, traditional algorithms such as the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) often suffer from limited exploration and premature convergence. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes an enhanced WOA which is called GLNWOA. GLNWOA integrates a log-normal distribution model into WOA to improve convergence dynamics and search diversity. GLNWOA employs a Good Nodes Set initialization for uniform population distribution, a Leader Cognitive Guidance Mechanism for efficient information sharing, and an Enhanced Spiral Updating Strategy to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Tests on benchmark functions verify its superior convergence accuracy and robustness. In WSN coverage optimization, deploying 25 nodes in a 60 m $\times$ 60 m area achieved a 99.0013\% coverage rate, outperforming AROA, WOA, HHO, ROA, and WOABAT by up to 15.5\%. These results demonstrate that GLNWOA offers fast convergence, high stability, and excellent optimization capability for intelligent network deployment.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架统一了识别与不确定性量化，为优化传感器布置和解释结构健康监测诊断的可信度提供了严格基础。

Abstract: In Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), the recovery of distributed mechanical parameters from sparse data is often ill-posed, raising critical questions about identifiability and the reliability of inferred states. While deterministic regularization methods such as Tikhonov stabilise the inversion, they provide little insight into the spatial limits of resolution or the inherent uncertainty of the solution. This paper presents a Bayesian inverse framework that rigorously quantifies these limits, using the identification of distributed flexural rigidity from rotation (tilt) influence lines as a primary case study. Fisher information is employed as a diagnostic metric to quantify sensor informativeness, revealing how specific sensor layouts and load paths constrain the recoverable spatial features of the parameter field.
  The methodology is applied to the full-scale openLAB research bridge (TU Dresden) using data from controlled vehicle passages. Beyond estimating the flexural rigidity profile, the Bayesian formulation produces credible intervals that expose regions of practical non-identifiability, which deterministic methods may obscure. The results demonstrate that while the measurement data carry high information content for the target parameters, their utility is spatially heterogeneous and strictly bounded by the experiment design. The proposed framework unifies identification with uncertainty quantification, providing a rigorous basis for optimising sensor placement and interpreting the credibility of SHM diagnostics.

TL;DR: 介绍了大语言模型驱动的AskDB，支持对SQL数据库进行自然语言的数据和管理操作，评估显示其在分析和管理场景表现好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统在通用数据库交互方面缺乏统一智能接口，不同专业水平用户与关系数据库交互有挑战。

Method: 基于Gemini 2构建AskDB，集成动态模式感知提示机制和任务分解框架。

Result: 在文本到SQL基准测试和DBA任务集上评估，在分析和管理场景表现良好。

Conclusion: AskDB有潜力成为关系数据库系统的统一智能代理，为终端用户提供直观体验。

Abstract: Interacting with relational databases remains challenging for users across different expertise levels, particularly when composing complex analytical queries or performing administrative tasks. Existing systems typically address either natural language querying or narrow aspects of database administration, lacking a unified and intelligent interface for general-purpose database interaction. We introduce AskDB, a large language model powered agent designed to bridge this gap by supporting both data analysis and administrative operations over SQL databases through natural language. Built on Gemini 2, AskDB integrates two key innovations: a dynamic schema-aware prompting mechanism that effectively incorporates database metadata, and a task decomposition framework that enables the agent to plan and execute multi-step actions. These capabilities allow AskDB to autonomously debug derived SQL, retrieve contextual information via real-time web search, and adaptively refine its responses. We evaluate AskDB on a widely used Text-to-SQL benchmark and a curated set of DBA tasks, demonstrating strong performance in both analytical and administrative scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of AskDB as a unified and intelligent agent for relational database systems, offering an intuitive and accessible experience for end users.

Motivation: 现有表格提取工具方法多样，用户难以选择合适工具，需要评估方法。

Method: 提出新基准，分析评估指标，设计评估流程，使用两个新的异质数据集和一个先前数据集对不同模型进行测试。

Result: 表格提取仍具挑战，当前方法在面对异质数据时缺乏泛化性，在鲁棒性和可解释性方面存在局限。

Conclusion: 表格提取任务目前存在诸多挑战，现有方法有待改进。

Abstract: Table Extraction (TE) consists in extracting tables from PDF documents, in a structured format which can be automatically processed. While numerous TE tools exist, the variety of methods and techniques makes it difficult for users to choose an appropriate one. We propose a novel benchmark for assessing end-to-end TE methods (from PDF to the final table). We contribute an analysis of TE evaluation metrics, and the design of a rigorous evaluation process, which allows scoring each TE sub-task as well as end-to-end TE, and captures model uncertainty. Along with a prior dataset, our benchmark comprises two new heterogeneous datasets of 37k samples. We run our benchmark on diverse models, including off-the-shelf libraries, software tools, large vision language models, and approaches based on computer vision. The results demonstrate that TE remains challenging: current methods suffer from a lack of generalizability when facing heterogeneous data, and from limitations in robustness and interpretability.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出SGLANG - LSM系统用于大语言模型KV缓存管理，评估显示其性能优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于磁盘的KV缓存系统因文件系统元数据开销、I/O效率低和空间局部性差存在可扩展性瓶颈。

Method: 借鉴数据库，采用LSM - tree架构，实现包含前缀保留存储引擎、自适应控制器和运行时服务的分层系统设计。

Result: 在大规模动态工作负载评估中，相比现有系统，缓存命中率最高提升143%，TTFT最多降低24%。

Conclusion: SGLANG - LSM是数据库存储架构在大规模大语言模型缓存管理中的首次系统应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) cache to reduce time- to-first-token (TTFT) latency, but existing disk-based KV cache systems using file-per-object layouts suffer from severe scalability bottlenecks due to file system metadata overhead, I/O inefficiency, and poor spatial locality. This paper presents SGLANG-LSM, a database-inspired system that leverages Log-Structured Merge- tree (LSM-tree) architectures for scalable KV cache management. SGLANG-LSM implements a layered system design with three coordinated components: (1) a prefix-preserving storage engine that maintains token sequence locality while efficiently storing large KV cache tensors through key-value separation, (2) an adaptive controller that dynamically optimizes LSM-tree configurations based on shifting workload characteristics, and (3) runtime services including batch opera- tions and automatic resource management for production deployment. Evaluation on large-scale dynamic workloads demonstrates that SGLANG-LSM significantly improves cache hits by up to 143% and reduces TTFT by up to 24% compared to state-of-the-art systems, representing the first systematic application of database storage architectures to large-scale LLM cache management.

Result: 提取不同属性的成分数据，增加各属性可用信息比例，新数据成分和属性值更多样。

Conclusion: 新提取数据拓展了玻璃建模应用的成分和属性空间，新数据库含更多特定氧化物。

Abstract: In this work, we present web scraping techniques to extract in- formation from patent tables, clean and structure them for future use in predictive machine learning models to develop new glasses. We extracted compositions and three properties relevant to the development of new glasses and structured them into a database to be used together with information from other available datasets. We also analyzed the consistency of the information obtained and what it adds to the existing databases. The extracted liquidus temperatures comprise 5,696 compositions; the second subset includes 4,298 refractive indexes and, finally, 1,771 compositions with Abbe numbers. The extraction performed here increases the available information by approximately 10.4% for liquidus temperature, 6.6% for refractive index, and 4.9% for Abbe number. The impact extends beyond quantity: the newly extracted data introduce compositions with property values that are more diverse than those in existing databases, thereby expanding the accessible compositional and property space for glass modeling applications. We emphasize that the compositions of the new database contain relatively more titanium, magnesium, zirconium, niobium, iron, tin, and yttrium oxides than those of the existing bases.

Motivation: 现有研究未探索基于计划的AQP在不同存储架构数据库中性能提升的真正原因，本文旨在填补该空白。

Method: 在磁盘和内存数据库上基于两个基准实现并评估基于计划的AQP策略。

Result: 基于计划的AQP在两种环境都有提速，但磁盘数据库PostgreSQL性能提升主要来自查询计划重排序，更新基数有开销；内存数据库DuckDB中基数细化带来性能提升。与相关方法对比有显著性能优势。

Conclusion: 研究为研究者提供基于计划的AQP何时及为何有效的见解，指导数据库开发者权衡实现成本与性能提升。

Abstract: Unreliable cardinality estimation remains a critical performance bottleneck in database management systems (DBMSs). Adaptive Query Processing (AQP) strategies address this limitation by providing a more robust query execution mechanism. Specifically, plan-based AQP achieves this by incrementally refining cardinality using feedback from the execution of sub-plans. However, the actual reason behind the improvements of plan-based AQP, especially across different storage architectures (on-disk vs. in-memory DBMSs), remains unexplored.
  This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art plan-based AQP. We implement and evaluate this strategy on both on-disk and in-memory DBMSs across two benchmarks. Our key findings reveal that while plan-based AQP provides overall speedups in both environments, the sources of improvement differ significantly. In the on-disk DBMS, PostgreSQL, performance gains primarily come from the query plan reorderings, but not the cardinality updating mechanism; in fact, updating cardinalities introduces measurable overhead. Conversely, in the in-memory DBMS, DuckDB, cardinality refinement drives significant performance improvements for most queries. We also observe significant performance benefits of the plan-based AQP compared to a state-of-the-art related-based AQP method. These observations provide crucial insights for researchers on when and why plan-based AQP is effective, and ultimately guide database system developers on the tradeoffs between the implementation effort and performance improvements.

Conclusion: 所提方法有潜力优化大规模基因组工作流，实现更快的端到端执行。

Abstract: Large-scale genomic workflows used in precision medicine can process datasets spanning tens to hundreds of gigabytes per sample, leading to high memory spikes, intensive disk I/O, and task failures due to out-of-memory errors. Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.

*Nasit S Sony,Xianzhong Ding*

TL;DR: 提出原子广播协议Slim - HBBFT，考虑部分方请求，提高通信复杂度，经安全分析满足异步公共子集协议属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异步拜占庭协议广播请求成本高，原子广播协议处理重复请求时采用高成本协议不合理，需改进。

Method: 设计优先可证明广播（P - PB）协议，仅为选定方生成广播证明，用其设计Slim - HBBFT协议。

Result: Slim - HBBFT考虑部分方请求，通信复杂度提高O(n)倍。

Conclusion: Slim - HBBFT满足异步公共子集协议属性，有强安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Byzantine agreement protocols in asynchronous networks have received renewed interest because they do not rely on network behavior to achieve termination. Conventional asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocols require every party to broadcast its requests (e.g., transactions), and at the end of the protocol, parties agree on one party's request. If parties agree on one party's requests while exchanging every party's request, the protocol becomes expensive. These protocols are used to design an atomic broadcast (ABC) protocol where parties agree on $\langle n-f \rangle$ parties' requests (assuming $n=3f+1$, where $n$ is the total number of parties, and $f$ is the number of Byzantine parties). Although the parties agree on a subset of requests in the ABC protocol, if the requests do not vary (are duplicated), investing in a costly protocol is not justified. We propose Slim-HBBFT, an atomic broadcast protocol that considers requests from a fraction of $n$ parties and improves communication complexity by a factor of $O(n)$. At the core of our design is a prioritized provable-broadcast (P-PB) protocol that generates proof of broadcast only for selected parties. We use the P-PB protocol to design the Slim-HBBFT atomic broadcast protocol. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive security analysis to demonstrate that Slim-HBBFT satisfies the properties of the Asynchronous Common Subset protocol, ensuring robust security and reliability.

Motivation: 通用矩阵乘法效率依赖有效分块策略，传统对称分块缓冲有局限，需新方法。

Method: 引入非对称分块缓冲技术，开发结合其益处和开销的性能模型以选择有效分块因子。

Result: 在AMD XDNA2 AI引擎的混合精度BFP16 - BF16 GEMM上实现从4.8到24.6 TFLOPS的加速，达4.54倍。

Conclusion: 非对称分块缓冲技术实用且高度有益，为XDNA2 AIE建立新性能记录。

Abstract: General matrix multiplication (GEMM) is the computational backbone of modern AI workloads, and its efficiency is critically dependent on effective tiling strategies. Conventional approaches employ symmetric tile buffering, where the buffered tile size of the input $A$ along the dimension $M$ matches the output tile size of $C$.
  In this paper, we introduce asymmetric tile buffering (ATB), a simple but powerful technique that decouples the buffered tile dimensions of the input and output operands. We show, for the first time, that ATB is both practical and highly beneficial. To explain this effect, we develop a performance model that incorporates both the benefits of ATB (higher arithmetic intensity) and its overheads (higher kernel switching costs), providing insight into how to select effective ATB tiling factors. As a case study, we apply ATB to AMD's latest XDNA2 AI Engine (AIE), achieving up to a 4.54x speedup, from 4.8 to 24.6 TFLOPS on mixed-precision BFP16--BF16 GEMM, establishing a new performance record for XDNA2 AIE.

Motivation: 传统I/O堆栈优化难泛化复用，共享HPC环境资源拥塞导致性能不可预测。

Method: 提出基于控制理论的自适应方法，利用少量运行时系统负载指标动态调节客户端I/O速率。

Result: 在多节点集群实现控制器并测试，该方法有效缓解I/O拥塞，最多减少20%总运行时间，降低尾延迟，保持性能稳定。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效应对HPC系统数据访问挑战，提升性能稳定性。

Abstract: Efficient data access in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems is essential to the performance of intensive computing tasks. Traditional optimizations of the I/O stack aim to improve peak performance but are often workload specific and require deep expertise, making them difficult to generalize or re-use. In shared HPC environments, resource congestion can lead to unpredictable performance, causing slowdowns and timeouts. To address these challenges, we propose a self-adaptive approach based on Control Theory to dynamically regulate client-side I/O rates. Our approach leverages a small set of runtime system load metrics to reduce congestion and enhance performance stability. We implement a controller in a multi-node cluster and evaluate it on a real testbed under a representative workload. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates I/O congestion, reducing total runtime by up to 20% and lowering tail latency, while maintaining stable performance.

Motivation: 经典分布式算法假设节点遵循协议，在节点有策略性时该假设不成立，且标准MIS算法在理性环境存在随机操控和不公平问题，需要新算法。

Method: 基于效用模型提出两种算法，随机数通过相邻节点两两交互产生，将其视为简单博弈。

Result: 证明在执行各阶段，假设其他节点遵循算法，单个节点无法通过单方面偏离增加期望效用；所有节点遵循协议时，每个节点有正概率加入MIS，最终输出正确MIS；在温和额外假设下，算法以高概率在O(log n)轮终止。

Conclusion: 提出的两种算法能解决理性节点下MIS计算问题，满足稳定性，且有较好的时间复杂度。

Abstract: We study the problem of computing a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) in distributed networks where each node is a rational agent whose payoff depends on whether it joins the MIS. Classical distributed algorithms assume that nodes follow the prescribed protocol, but this assumption fails when nodes are strategic and may deviate if doing so increases their expected utility.
  Standard MIS algorithms rely on honest randomness or unique identifiers to break symmetry. In rational settings, however, agents may manipulate randomness, and relying solely on identifiers can create unfairness, giving some nodes zero probability of joining the MIS and thus no incentive to participate. To address these issues, we propose two algorithms based on a utility model in which agents seek locally correct solutions while also having preferences over which solution is chosen. Randomness in our algorithms is generated through pairwise interactions between neighboring nodes, viewed as simple games in which no single node can unilaterally affect the outcome. This allows symmetry breaking while remaining compatible with rational behavior.
  For both algorithms, we prove that at every stage of the execution, given any history, no agent can increase its expected utility through a unilateral deviation, assuming others follow the algorithm. This gives a stronger guarantee than Trembling-Hand Perfect Equilibrium. When all nodes follow the protocol, every node has a positive probability of joining the MIS, and the final output is a correct MIS. Under mild additional assumptions, both algorithms terminate in $O(\log n)$ rounds with high probability.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型后期训练中Rollout过程耗时久的问题。

Method: 采用动态解耦推测执行方法提升GPU计算效率，以及动态Best-of-N推测方法根据Rollout进度选择和组合不同起草方法。

Result: SpecActor比常见后期训练基线快1.3 - 1.7倍，比简单采用推测解码进行Rollout快1.3 - 1.5倍。

Conclusion: SpecActor有效加速大语言模型训练中的Rollout过程，提升了推测准确性且无需额外计算资源。

Abstract: Rollout dominates the training time in large language model (LLM) post-training, where the trained model is used to generate tokens given a batch of prompts. SpecActor achieves fast rollout with speculative decoding that deploys a fast path (e.g., a smaller model) to accelerate the unparallelizable generation, while the correctness is guaranteed by fast parallel verification of the outputs with the original model. SpecActor addresses two foundational challenges in speculative rollout by (1) a \emph{dynamic decoupled speculation} execution method that maximizes the GPU computational efficiency to realize speedup for large-batch execution -- a configuration common in training but unfriendly to speculative execution and (2) a \emph{dynamic Best-of-N speculation} method that selects and combines different drafting methods according to the rollout progress. It substantially improves the speculation accuracy even when the best drafting method is unknown a priori, meanwhile without requiring adding extra computation resources. {\sys} is {1.3--1.7}\,$\times$ faster than common post-training baselines, and is {1.3--1.5}\,$\times$ faster compared to naively adopting speculative decoding for rollout.

Conclusion: 所提出的技术能确保大语言模型在现实联邦学习场景中有更好表现。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for training machine learning models across distributed data sources while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces critical challenges related to communication overhead and local resource constraints, especially in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. The sheer size of these models exacerbates both memory and communication constraints, making efficient transmission and processing essential for practical deployment. NVIDIA FLARE, an open-source SDK for federated learning, addresses these challenges by introducing advanced communication capabilities. Building upon existing solutions for large object streaming, we enhance FL workflows for LLMs through two key techniques: message quantization and container/file streaming. Quantization reduces message size, while streaming enables efficient memory management, improving scalability and integration with existing workflows. These advancements significantly enhance the robustness and efficiency of FL with LLMs, ensuring better performance in real-world federated learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop a framework for handling graph separation problems with connectivity constraints. Extending the classical concept of important separators, we introduce and analyze connectivity-preserving important separators, which are important separators that not only disconnect designated terminal sets $A$ and $B$ but also satisfy an arbitrary set of connectivity constraints over the terminals. These constraints can express requirements such as preserving the internal connectivity of each terminal set, enforcing pairwise connections defined by an equivalence relation, or maintaining reachability from a specified subset of vertices. We prove that for any graph $G=(V,E)$, terminal sets $A,B\subseteq V$, and integer $k$, the number of important $A,B$-separators of size at most $k$ satisfying a set of connectivity constraints is bounded by $2^{O(k\log k)}$, and that all such separators can be enumerated within $O(2^{O(k\log k)} \cdot n \cdot T(n,m))$ time, where $T(n,m)$ is the time required to compute a minimum $s,t$-separator. As an application, we obtain a new fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm for the Node Multiway Cut-Uncut (N-MWCU) problem, parameterized by $k$, the size of the separator set. The algorithm runs in $O(2^{O(k\log k)} \cdot n \cdot m^{1+o(1)})$ time for graphs with polynomially-bounded integer weights. This significantly improves the dependence on $k$ from the previous $2^{O(k^2\log k)}$ to $2^{O(k\log k)}$, thereby breaking a long-standing barrier, and simultaneously improves the polynomial factors. Our framework generalises the important-separator paradigm to separation problems in which the deletion set must satisfy both cut and uncut constraints on terminal subsets, thus offering a refined combinatorial foundation for designing fixed-parameter algorithms for cut-uncut problems in graphs.

Our input is a sequence of jobs specified by their release time, deadline and processing time. We assume that jobs are announced before or at their release time. At each time step, the algorithm must decide whether to schedule a job based on the information so far. The goal is to maximize the value of the sum of the processing times of jobs that finish before their deadline, or the total ``active'' time.
  We extend this problem by defining a notion of $t$-advance-notice, a measure of how far in advance each job is given relative to their processing time. We show that there exists a $\frac{t}{2t+1}$-competitive algorithm when all jobs have $t$-advance-notice for $t\in [0,1]$. We also show that this ratio is optimal for all algorithms with $t$-advance-notice and that the upper bound of $\frac{t}{2t+1}$-competitiveness holds for all $t$, in particular that regardless of how much advance-notice is given, no algorithm can reach $\frac{1}{2}$-competitiveness.

Motivation: 经典模型未考虑供应端库存冲击对收益的影响，现实中库存冲击对在线商品规划有重要作用。

Conclusion: IB类策略对库存冲击具有鲁棒性，BIB算法在新模型中表现更优。

Abstract: In classic adversarial online resource allocation problems such as AdWords, customers arrive online while products are given offline with a fixed initial inventory. To ensure revenue guarantees under uncertainty, the decision maker must balance consumption across products. Based on this, the prevalent policy "inventory balancing (IB)" has proved to be optimal or near-optimal competitive in almost all classic settings. However, these models do not capture various forms of inventory shocks on the supply side, which play an important role in real-world online assortment and can significantly impact the revenue performance of the IB algorithm.
  Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce a variant of online assortment planning with inventory shocks. Our model considers adversarial exogenous shocks (where supply increases unpredictably) and allocation-coupled endogenous shocks (where an inventory reduction is triggered by the algorithms and re-adjusted after a usage duration), whose combination leads to non-monotonic inventory fluctuations. As our main result, we show the robustness of IB-type strategies against such shocks by designing a new family of optimal competitive algorithms called "Batched Inventory Balancing (BIB)." Using a novel randomized primal-dual method, we bound the competitive ratio of BIB against optimal offline. We show that with proper choice of a certain parameter, this competitive ratio is asymptotically optimal and converges to (1-1/e) as initial inventories grow, in contrast to the original IB which no longer achieves the optimal ratio in this new model. Moreover, we characterize BIB's competitive ratio parametric by its penalty function and show that it matches exactly the competitive ratio of IB without shocks. Our refined analysis reduces the dual construction to a combinatorial "interval assignment problem" whose algorithmic solution may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Online bipartite matching is a classical problem in online algorithms and we know that both the deterministic fractional and randomized integral online matchings achieve the same competitive ratio of $1-\frac{1}{e}$. In this work, we study classes of graphs where the online degree is restricted to $2$. As expected, one can achieve a competitive ratio of better than $1-\frac{1}{e}$ in both the deterministic fractional and randomized integral cases, but surprisingly, these ratios are not the same. It was already known that for fractional matching, a $0.75$ competitive ratio algorithm is optimal. We show that the folklore \textsc{Half-Half} algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $η\approx 0.717772\dots$ and more surprisingly, show that this is optimal by giving a matching lower-bound. This yields a separation between the two problems: deterministic fractional and randomized integral, showing that it is impossible to obtain a perfect rounding scheme.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper considers using predictions in the context of the online Joint Replenishment Problem with Deadlines (JRP-D). Prior work includes asymptotically optimal competitive ratios of $O(1)$ for the clairvoyant setting and $O(\sqrt{n})$ of the nonclairvoyant setting, where $n$ is the number of items. The goal of this paper is to significantly reduce the competitive ratio for the nonclairvoyant case by leveraging predictions: when a request arrives, the true deadline of the request is not revealed, but the algorithm is given a predicted deadline.
  The main result is an algorithm whose competitive ratio is $O(\min(η^{1/3}\log^{2/3}(n), \sqrtη, \sqrt{n}))$, where $n$ is the number of item types and $η\leq n^2$ quantifies how flawed the predictions are in terms of the number of ``instantaneous item inversions.'' Thus, the algorithm is robust, i.e., it is never worse than the nonclairvoyant solution, and it is consistent, i.e., if the predictions exhibit no inversions, then the algorithm behaves similarly to the clairvoyant algorithm. Moreover, if the error is not too large, specifically $η< o(n^{3/2}/\log^2(n))$, then the algorithm obtains an asymptotically better competitive ratio than the nonclairvoyant algorithm. We also show that all deterministic algorithms falling in a certain reasonable class of algorithms have a competitive ratio of $Ω(η^{1/3})$, so this algorithm is nearly the best possible with respect to this error metric.

Conclusion: 对不同k值的图着色问题有算法改进，随机算法在二分图情况表现稍好但仍有局限。

Abstract: We study the problem of online graph coloring for $k$-colorable graphs. The best previously known deterministic algorithm uses $\tilde{O}(n^{1-1/k!})$ colors for general $k$ and $\tilde{O}(n^{5/6})$ colors for $k = 4$, both given by Kierstead in 1998. In this paper, nearly thirty years later, we have finally made progress. Our results are summarized as follows:
  (1) $k \geq 5$ case. We provide a deterministic online algorithm to color $k$-colorable graphs with $\tilde{O}(n^{1-2/(k(k-1))})$ colors, significantly improving the current upper bound of $\tilde{O}(n^{1-1/k!})$
  (2) $k = 4$ case. We provide a deterministic online algorithm to color $4$-colorable graphs with $\tilde{O}(n^{14/17})$ colors, improving the current upper bound of $\tilde{O}(n^{5/6})$ colors.
  (3) $k = 2$ case. We show that for randomized algorithms, the upper bound is $1.034 \log_2 n + O(1)$ colors and the lower bound is $\frac{91}{96} \log_2 n - O(1)$ colors. This means that we close the gap to $1.09\mathrm{x}$.
  With our algorithm for the $k \geq 5$ case, we also obtain a deterministic online algorithm for graph coloring that achieves a competitive ratio of $O(n / \log \log n)$, which improves the best known result of $O(n \log \log \log n / \log \log n)$ by Kierstead.
  For the bipartite graph case ($k = 2$), the limit of online deterministic algorithms is known: any deterministic algorithm requires $2 \log_2 n - O(1)$ colors. Our results imply that randomized algorithms can perform slightly better but still have a limit.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Kemeny constant, defined as the expected hitting time of random walks from a source node to a randomly chosen target node, is a fundamental metric in graph data management with many real-world applications. However, computing it exactly on large graphs is highly challenging, as it requires inverting large graph matrices. Existing solutions mainly rely on approximate random-walk-based methods, which still need large sample sizes and lack strong theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a new approach for approximating the Kemeny constant via 2-forest sampling. We first derive an unbiased estimator expressed through spanning trees by introducing a path mapping technique that establishes a direct correspondence between spanning trees and certain classes of 2-forests. Compared to random walk-based estimators, 2-forest-based estimators yield leads to a better theoretical bound. We further design efficient algorithms to sample and traverse spanning trees, leveraging data structures such as the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) for optimization. Our theoretical analysis shows that the Kemeny constant can be approximated with relative error $ε$ in $O\left(\frac{Δ^2\bar{d}^2}{ε^2}(τ+ n\min(\log n, Δ))\right)$ time, where $τ$ is the tree-sampling time, $\bar{d}$ is the average degree, and $Δ$ is the graph diameter. This complexity is near-linear in practice. Moreover, existing methods largely target static graphs and lack efficient mechanisms for dynamic updates. To address this, we propose two sample maintenance strategies that partially update samples while preserving accuracy on dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments on 10 large real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both efficiency and accuracy on static and dynamic graphs.

Conclusion: 尽管几何问题缺乏结构，但可通过转化和递归求解得到更好的近似算法。

Abstract: We study the general scheduling problem (GSP) which generalizes and unifies several well-studied preemptive single-machine scheduling problems, such as weighted flow time, weighted sum of completion time, and minimizing the total weight of tardy jobs. We are given a set of jobs with their processing times and release times and seek to compute a (possibly preemptive) schedule for them on one machine. Each job incurs a cost that depends on its completion time in the computed schedule, as given by a separate job-dependent cost function for each job, and our objective is to minimize the total resulting cost of all jobs. The best known result for GSP is a polynomial time $O(\log\log P)$-approximation algorithm [Bansal and Pruhs, FOCS 2010, SICOMP 2014].
  We give a quasi-polynomial time $(2+ε)$-approximation algorithm for GSP, assuming that the jobs' processing times are quasi-polynomially bounded integers. For the special case of the weighted tardiness objective, we even obtain an improved approximation ratio of $1+ε$. For this case, no better result had been known than the mentioned $O(\log\log P)$-approximation for the general case of GSP. Our algorithms use a reduction to an auxiliary geometric covering problem. In contrast to a related reduction for the special case of weighted flow time [Rohwedder, Wiese, STOC 2021][Armbruster, Rohwedder, Wiese, STOC 2023] for GSP it seems no longer possible to establish a tree-like structure for the rectangles to guide an algorithm that solves this geometric problem. Despite the lack of structure due to the problem itself, we show that an optimal solution can be transformed into a near-optimal solution that has certain structural properties. Due to those we can guess a substantial part of the solution quickly and partition the remaining problem in an intricate way, such that we can independently solve each part recursively.

As a special case, we believe that the new prior-free NTU-GUM implements a 1.283-approximation to Pareto efficiency for the repeated single good allocation problem in Fikioris, Banerjee, and Tardos (2024).

Conclusion: Meinhardt方法在特定类博弈中是多项式时间算法。

Abstract: Recently, Maggiorano et al. (2025) claimed that they have developed a strongly polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm for the nucleolus in convex games that is based on the reduced game approach and submodular function minimization method. Thereby, avoiding the ellipsoid method with its negative side effects in numerical computation completely. However, we shall argue that this is a fallacy based on an incorrect application of the Davis/Maschler reduced game property (RGP). Ignoring the fact that despite the pre-nucleolus, other solutions like the core, pre-kernel, and semi-reactive pre-bargaining set possess this property as well. This causes a severe selection issue, leading to the failure to compute the nucleolus of convex games using the reduced games approach. In order to assess this finding in its context, the ellipsoid method of Faigle et al. (2001) and the Fenchel-Moreau conjugation-based approach from convex analysis of Meinhardt (2013) to compute a pre-kernel element were resumed. In the latter case, it was exploited that for TU games with a single-valued pre-kernel, both solution concepts coincide. Implying that one has computed the pre-nucleolus if one has found the sole pre-kernel element of the game. Though it is a specialized and highly optimized algorithm for the pre-kernel, it assures runtime complexity of O(n^3) for computing the pre-nucleolus whenever the pre-kernel is a single point, which indicates a polynomial-time algorithm for this class of games.

Abstract: We present QueryGym, a lightweight, extensible Python toolkit that supports large language model (LLM)-based query reformulation. This is an important tool development since recent work on llm-based query reformulation has shown notable increase in retrieval effectiveness. However, while different authors have sporadically shared the implementation of their methods, there is no unified toolkit that provides a consistent implementation of such methods, which hinders fair comparison, rapid experimentation, consistent benchmarking and reliable deployment. QueryGym addresses this gap by providing a unified framework for implementing, executing, and comparing llm-based reformulation methods. The toolkit offers: (1) a Python API for applying diverse LLM-based methods, (2) a retrieval-agnostic interface supporting integration with backends such as Pyserini and PyTerrier, (3) a centralized prompt management system with versioning and metadata tracking, (4) built-in support for benchmarks like BEIR and MS MARCO, and (5) a completely open-source extensible implementation available to all researchers.

Conclusion: 简单扩展Chamfer距离函数，能有效增强晚交互多向量机制的表达力。

Abstract: ColBERT introduced a late interaction mechanism that independently encodes queries and documents using BERT, and computes similarity via fine-grained interactions over token-level vector representations. This design enables expressive matching while allowing efficient computation of scores, as the multi-vector document representations could be pre-computed offline. ColBERT models distance using a Chamfer-style function: for each query token, it selects the closest document token and sums these distances across all query tokens.
  In our work, we explore enhancements to the Chamfer distance function by computing a weighted sum over query token contributions, where weights reflect the token importance. Empirically, we show that this simple extension, requiring only token-weight training while keeping the multi-vector representations fixed, further enhances the expressiveness of late interaction multi-vector mechanism. In particular, on the BEIR benchmark, our method achieves an average improvement of 1.28\% in Recall@10 in the zero-shot setting using IDF-based weights, and 3.66\% through few-shot fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 提出了一种构建以答案为中心的检索器的有效方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge-intensive tasks, yet its effectiveness in long-context scenarios is often bottlenecked by the retriever's inability to distinguish sparse yet crucial evidence. Standard retrievers, optimized for query-document similarity, frequently fail to align with the downstream goal of generating a precise answer. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework that optimizes the retriever for Answer Alignment. Specifically, we first identify high-quality positive chunks by evaluating their sufficiency to generate the correct answer. We then employ a curriculum-based contrastive learning scheme to fine-tune the retriever. This curriculum leverages LLM-constructed Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to generate augmented queries, which in turn mine progressively challenging hard negatives. This process trains the retriever to distinguish the answer-sufficient positive chunks from these nuanced distractors, enhancing its generalization. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets from the Ultradomain and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that our fine-tuned retriever achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving 14.5% over the base model without substantial architectural modifications and maintaining strong efficiency for long-context RAG. Our work presents a robust and effective methodology for building truly answer-centric retrievers.

Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in sequential recommendations, and the adoption of LLM-based recommender systems (LLMRec) is becoming increasingly widespread in existing e-commerce platforms. Despite the impressive performance, the constant high volume of new user-item interactions makes it difficult to adapt to the evolution of user preference over time, especially for LLM-based recommender systems. The challenge arises from the large number of parameters in LLMs, which makes traditional evolution methods (i.e., Re-training or Fine-tuning) impractical. Specifically, Re-training with all interactions results in prohibitively high computational costs. On the other hand, fine-tuning with only new interactions leads to preference forgetting among inactive users, ultimately compromising overall performance. To tackle this problem, we propose EvoRec, an efficient Locate-Forget-Update framework designed for LLM-based recommender systems to model the evolution of user preferences. EvoRec identifies a small set of parameters associated with preference changes and updates them precisely, thereby saving computational resources while maintaining strong recommendation performance. Notably, the modified parameters account for only 30\% of LoRA adapter parameters, with no additional parameters introduced. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, EvoRec not only efficiently evolves LLMRec to adapt to the preferences of active users, but also preserves the interests of inactive users from being disturbed during evolution.

Conclusion: 为音乐推荐系统社区提供更新的、有教育意义的跨学科评估视角。

Abstract: Music Recommender Systems (MRS) have long relied on an information-retrieval framing, where progress is measured mainly through accuracy on retrieval-oriented subtasks. While effective, this reductionist paradigm struggles to address the deeper question of what makes a good recommendation, and attempts to broaden evaluation, through user studies or fairness analyses, have had limited impact. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) disrupts this framework: LLMs are generative rather than ranking-based, making standard accuracy metrics questionable. They also introduce challenges such as hallucinations, knowledge cutoffs, non-determinism, and opaque training data, rendering traditional train/test protocols difficult to interpret. At the same time, LLMs create new opportunities, enabling natural-language interaction and even allowing models to act as evaluators.
  This work argues that the shift toward LLM-driven MRS requires rethinking evaluation. We first review how LLMs reshape user modeling, item modeling, and natural-language recommendation in music. We then examine evaluation practices from NLP, highlighting methodologies and open challenges relevant to MRS. Finally, we synthesize insights-focusing on how LLM prompting applies to MRS, to outline a structured set of success and risk dimensions. Our goal is to provide the MRS community with an updated, pedagogical, and cross-disciplinary perspective on evaluation.

  Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.
  Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference. These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.

*Alima Subedi,Sankalpa Pokharel,Satish Puri*

TL;DR: 提出PolyMinHash系统用于多边形近似相似性搜索，介绍其机制及搜索准确性与运行时间的权衡，该机制能大幅减少候选处理数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据集增大，精确最近邻搜索不可行，现有研究在空间数据库和地理信息系统中针对多边形的近似最近邻搜索较少。

Method: 将MinHashing适配为新颖的二维多边形哈希方案，通过计算随机采样点落入多边形内部所需的采样点数生成哈希值，以保留基于面积的Jaccard相似性。

Result: 该哈希机制与暴力算法相比，在查询细化阶段可将待处理的候选数量最多减少98%。

Conclusion: PolyMinHash系统能有效进行多边形近似相似性搜索，在减少候选处理数量上有显著效果。

Abstract: Similarity searches are a critical task in data mining. As data sets grow larger, exact nearest neighbor searches quickly become unfeasible, leading to the adoption of approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searches. ANN has been studied for text data, images, and trajectories. However, there has been little effort to develop ANN systems for polygons in spatial database systems and geographic information systems. We present PolyMinHash, a system for approximate polygon similarity search that adapts MinHashing into a novel 2D polygon-hashing scheme to generate short, similarity-preserving signatures of input polygons. Minhash is generated by counting the number of randomly sampled points needed before the sampled point lands within the polygon's interior area, yielding hash values that preserve area-based Jaccard similarity. We present the tradeoff between search accuracy and runtime of our PolyMinHash system. Our hashing mechanism reduces the number of candidates to be processed in the query refinement phase by up to 98% compared to the number of candidates processed by the brute-force algorithm.

Abstract: Reasoning reinforcement learning (RL) has recently revealed a new scaling effect: test-time scaling. Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.

Abstract: Operational forecasting of the ionosphere remains a critical space weather challenge due to sparse observations, complex coupling across geospatial layers, and a growing need for timely, accurate predictions that support Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), communications, aviation safety, as well as satellite operations. As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts.

Conclusion: 基于覆盖率驱动的偏好优化用于基于LLM的硬件验证是有效的。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in applying them to hardware design and verification. Among these stages, design verification remains the most time-consuming and resource-intensive phase, where generating effective stimuli for the design under test (DUT) is both critical and labor-intensive. We present {\it TB or not TB}, a framework for automated stimulus generation using LLMs fine-tuned through Coverage-Driven Direct Preference Optimization (CD-DPO). To enable preference-based training, we introduce PairaNet, a dataset derived from PyraNet that pairs high- and low-quality testbenches labeled using simulation-derived coverage metrics. The proposed CD-DPO method integrates quantitative coverage feedback directly into the optimization objective, guiding the model toward generating stimuli that maximize verification coverage. Experiments on the CVDP CID12 benchmark show that {\it TB or not TB} outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines, achieving up to 77.27\% improvement in code coverage, demonstrating the effectiveness of Coverage-driven preference optimization for LLM-based hardware verification.

Motivation: 现有OCR系统对抗扰动防御方法存在模型特定、计算昂贵、影响正常输入性能且易受未知攻击等问题。

Method: 引入TopoReformer，利用拓扑特征，采用拓扑自动编码器在潜在空间强制流形级一致性。

Result: 在EMNIST、MNIST上针对多种攻击类型进行基准测试。

Conclusion: 文档未明确提及具体结论，但暗示TopoReformer可能有效缓解对抗扰动。

Abstract: Adversarially perturbed images of text can cause sophisticated OCR systems to produce misleading or incorrect transcriptions from seemingly invisible changes to humans. Some of these perturbations even survive physical capture, posing security risks to high-stakes applications such as document processing, license plate recognition, and automated compliance systems. Existing defenses, such as adversarial training, input preprocessing, or post-recognition correction, are often model-specific, computationally expensive, and affect performance on unperturbed inputs while remaining vulnerable to unseen or adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, TopoReformer is introduced, a model-agnostic reformation pipeline that mitigates adversarial perturbations while preserving the structural integrity of text images. Topology studies properties of shapes and spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, focusing on global structures such as connectivity, holes, and loops rather than exact distance. Leveraging these topological features, TopoReformer employs a topological autoencoder to enforce manifold-level consistency in latent space and improve robustness without explicit gradient regularization. The proposed method is benchmarked on EMNIST, MNIST, against standard adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), adaptive attacks (EOT, BDPA), and an OCR-specific watermark attack (FAWA).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce a new low-noise condition for classification, the Model Margin Noise (MM noise) assumption, and derive enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds under this condition. MM noise is weaker than Tsybakov noise condition: it is implied by Tsybakov noise condition but can hold even when Tsybakov fails, because it depends on the discrepancy between a given hypothesis and the Bayes-classifier rather than on the intrinsic distributional minimal margin (see Figure 1 for an illustration of an explicit example). This hypothesis-dependent assumption yields enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds for both binary and multi-class classification. Our results extend the enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds of Mao, Mohri, and Zhong (2025a) with the same favorable exponents but under a weaker assumption than the Tsybakov noise condition; they interpolate smoothly between linear and square-root regimes for intermediate noise levels. We also instantiate these bounds for common surrogate loss families and provide illustrative tables.

Motivation: 标准OCP存在使用简单非一致性分数在输出空间操作、均匀处理历史观测的局限，需要改进。

Method: AFOCP在预训练神经网络特征空间操作，利用学习的表示构建更紧凑预测集；引入注意力机制对历史观测自适应加权。

Result: 理论上在温和正则条件下比标准OCP预测区间更小；实验中在合成和真实世界时间序列数据集上，相比OCP最多缩小88%预测区间并保持目标覆盖水平。

Conclusion: AFOCP通过特征空间校准和基于注意力的自适应加权，能有效缩小预测区间并保持覆盖保证。

Abstract: Online conformal prediction (OCP) wraps around any pre-trained predictor to produce prediction sets with coverage guarantees that hold irrespective of temporal dependencies or distribution shifts. However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.

Result: 在MIMIC - III基准上，集成模型比最佳单模型有更好的区分度（AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526；AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876），保持校准预测，模态缺失时有校准回退机制保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该模型有有竞争力的性能、可靠可审计的风险估计、透明可预测的操作，对临床应用至关重要。

Abstract: Early identification of intensive care patients at risk of in-hospital mortality enables timely intervention and efficient resource allocation. Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions. The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing. These results demonstrate competitive performance with reliable, auditable risk estimates and transparent, predictable operation, which together are crucial for clinical use.

Abstract: We introduce GLOBE, a new neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that draws inductive bias from boundary-element methods and equivariant ML. GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.
  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the "Full" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the "Scarce" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.
  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.
  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).

Abstract: Speculative sampling reduces the latency of autoregressive decoding for target model LLMs without sacrificing inference quality, by using a cheap draft model to suggest a candidate token and a verification criterion to accept or resample this token. To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings. Our findings give the first multi-draft algorithm with 90% acceptance and under 100 ms of overhead per generated token with negligible deviation from the target model distribution.

Abstract: Generative models for structure-based drug design are often limited to a specific modality, restricting their broader applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/funcbind.

AccelOpt explores the kernel optimization space through iterative generation, informed by an optimization memory that curates experiences and insights from previously encountered slow-fast kernel pairs. We build NKIBench, a new benchmark suite of AWS Trainium accelerator kernels with varying complexity extracted from real-world LLM workloads to evaluate the effectiveness of AccelOpt. Our evaluation confirms that AccelOpt's capability improves over time, boosting the average percentage of peak throughput from $49\%$ to $61\%$ on Trainium 1 and from $45\%$ to $59\%$ on Trainium 2 for NKIBench kernels. Moreover, AccelOpt is highly cost-effective: using open-source models, it matches the kernel improvements of Claude Sonnet 4 while being $26\times$ cheaper.

Conclusion: TLT系统能有效无损加速推理强化学习训练。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/fastrl.

Result: DiffuApriel性能与基于Transformer的扩散模型相当，长序列推理吞吐量最高达4.4倍；DiffuApriel - H吞吐量最高提升2.6倍。

Conclusion: 双向状态空间架构可作为掩码扩散语言模型的强大去噪器，为文本生成提供实用可扩展基础。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, yet their reliance on Transformer backbones limits inference efficiency due to quadratic attention and KV-cache overhead. In this work, we introduce DiffuApriel, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling. DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.

Abstract: Scalable Gaussian process (GP) inference is essential for sequential decision-making tasks, yet improving GP scalability remains a challenging problem with many open avenues of research. This paper focuses on iterative GPs, where iterative linear solvers, such as conjugate gradients, stochastic gradient descent or alternative projections, are used to approximate the GP posterior. We propose a new method which improves solver convergence of a large linear system by leveraging the known solution to a smaller system contained within. This is significant for tasks with incremental data additions, and we show that our technique achieves speed-ups when solving to tolerance, as well as improved Bayesian optimisation performance under a fixed compute budget.

Abstract: Tabular data underpins decisions across science, industry, and public services. Despite rapid progress, advances in deep learning have not fully carried over to the tabular domain, where gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) remain a default choice in practice. We present iLTM, an integrated Large Tabular Model that unifies tree-derived embeddings, dimensionality-agnostic representations, a meta-trained hypernetwork, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and retrieval within a single architecture. Pretrained on more than 1,800 heterogeneous classification datasets, iLTM achieves consistently superior performance across tabular classification and regression tasks, from small datasets to large and high-dimensional tasks. After light fine-tuning, the meta-trained hypernetwork transfers to regression targets, matching or surpassing strong baselines. Extensive experiments show that iLTM outperforms well-tuned GBDTs and leading deep tabular models while requiring less task-specific tuning. By bridging the gap between tree-based and neural methods, iLTM offers a new framework for tabular foundation models for robust, adaptable, and scalable tabular learning.

Conclusion: LDP是一种有原则且有效的预处理公平干预技术。

Abstract: We investigate how to optimally design local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms that reduce data unfairness and thereby improve fairness in downstream classification. We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes. Taken together, these results highlight LDP as a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.

Conclusion: 统一光谱潜空间能有效利用更大更多样的MIR数据集，对当前NIR库中代表性不足的土壤性质进行预测。

Abstract: We propose a self-supervised machine learning (SSML) framework for multi-fidelity learning and extended predictive soil spectroscopy based on latent space embeddings. A self-supervised representation was pretrained with the large MIR spectral library and the Variational Autoencoder algorithm to obtain a compressed latent space for generating spectral embeddings. At this stage, only unlabeled spectral data were used, allowing us to leverage the full spectral database and the availability of scan repeats for augmented training. We also leveraged and froze the trained MIR decoder for a spectrum conversion task by plugging it into a NIR encoder to learn the mapping between NIR and MIR spectra in an attempt to leverage the predictive capabilities contained in the large MIR library with a low cost portable NIR scanner. This was achieved by using a smaller subset of the KSSL library with paired NIR and MIR spectra. Downstream machine learning models were then trained to map between original spectra, predicted spectra, and latent space embeddings for nine soil properties. The performance of was evaluated independently of the KSSL training data using a gold-standard test set, along with regression goodness-of-fit metrics. Compared to baseline models, the proposed SSML and its embeddings yielded similar or better accuracy in all soil properties prediction tasks. Predictions derived from the spectrum conversion (NIR to MIR) task did not match the performance of the original MIR spectra but were similar or superior to predictive performance of NIR-only models, suggesting the unified spectral latent space can effectively leverage the larger and more diverse MIR dataset for prediction of soil properties not well represented in current NIR libraries.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is increasingly essential as modern models become more complex and high-stakes applications demand transparency, trust, and regulatory compliance. Existing global attribution methods often incur high computational costs, lack stability under correlated inputs, and fail to scale efficiently to large or heterogeneous datasets. We address these gaps with \emph{ExCIR} (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a correlation-aware attribution score equipped with a lightweight transfer protocol that reproduces full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data. ExCIR quantifies sign-aligned co-movement between features and model outputs after \emph{robust centering} (subtracting a robust location estimate, e.g., median or mid-mean, from features and outputs). We further introduce \textsc{BlockCIR}, a \emph{groupwise} extension of ExCIR that scores \emph{sets} of correlated features as a single unit. By aggregating the same signed-co-movement numerators and magnitudes over predefined or data-driven groups, \textsc{BlockCIR} mitigates double-counting in collinear clusters (e.g., synonyms or duplicated sensors) and yields smoother, more stable rankings when strong dependencies are present. Across diverse text, tabular, signal, and image datasets, ExCIR shows trustworthy agreement with established global baselines and the full model, delivers consistent top-$k$ rankings across settings, and reduces runtime via lightweight evaluation on a subset of rows. Overall, ExCIR provides \emph{computationally efficient}, \emph{consistent}, and \emph{scalable} explainability for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The lack of epidemiological data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a fundamental difficulty in constructing robust models to forecast and mitigate threats such as viruses and worms. Many studies have examined different epidemic models for WSNs, focusing on how malware infections spread given the network's specific properties, including energy limits and node mobility. In this study, an agent-based implementation of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-vaccinated (SEIRV) mathematical model was employed for machine learning (ML) predictions. Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms. Posed as a regression problem, the infected and recovered nodes were predicted, and the performance of these algorithms is compared using the error metrics of the train and test sets. The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set. The validation values were lower (0.992, 0.998, 0.971, and 0.999), as is typical when evaluating model performance on unseen data. Based on the recorded performances, support vector, linear, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet regression were among the worst-performing algorithms, while Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and k-nearest neighbors achieved the best results.

Abstract: Clinical trials face mounting challenges: fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and unsustainable costs, particularly for late phase trials in oncology and rare diseases. While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.

Motivation: 已有算法虽易实现且有可证明的遗忘保证，但随机版本的D2D在非凸函数上缺乏理论支持，需要为随机R2D和D2D提供理论保证。

Result: 证明了随机R2D和D2D在不同损失函数下的(ε, δ)认证遗忘保证，发现D2D在强凸函数上有更严格保证，R2D能在凸和非凸环境实现遗忘。

Conclusion: 为随机R2D和D2D提供了理论支持，明确了两种算法在不同函数下的优势。

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the impact of selected training data from a model without the computational expenses of retraining from scratch. Two such algorithms are ``Descent-to-Delete" (D2D) and ``Rewind-to-Delete" (R2D), full-batch gradient descent algorithms that are easy to implement and satisfy provable unlearning guarantees. In particular, the stochastic version of D2D is widely implemented as the ``finetuning" unlearning baseline, despite lacking theoretical backing on nonconvex functions. In this work, we prove $(ε, δ)$ certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic R2D and D2D for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions, by analyzing unlearning through the lens of disturbed or biased gradient systems, which may be contracting, semi-contracting, or expansive respectively. Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(ε, δ)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum. However, unlike D2D, R2D can achieve unlearning in the convex and nonconvex setting because it draws the unlearned model closer to the retrained model by reversing the accumulated disturbances.

Result: 单独使用SGA和RTM可改善反事实结果估计，组合使用达最优性能

Conclusion: SGA和RTM角色互补，RTM增强时间泛化和鲁棒性，SGA改善特定时间去混杂

Abstract: Estimating counterfactual outcomes from time-series observations is crucial for effective decision-making, e.g. when to administer a life-saving treatment, yet remains significantly challenging because (i) the counterfactual trajectory is never observed and (ii) confounders evolve with time and distort estimation at every step. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.

Conclusion: ECPv2是一种可扩展且理论完善的全局优化算法，性能优越。

Abstract: We propose ECPv2, a scalable and theoretically grounded algorithm for global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous functions with unknown Lipschitz constants. Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.

Abstract: High-resolution mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a cornerstone of sustainable urbanism but remains critically hindered by the spatial sparsity of ground monitoring networks. While traditional data-driven methods attempt to bridge this gap using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), they often suffer from severe, non-random data missingness (e.g., due to cloud cover or nighttime) and inversion biases. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the Spatiotemporal Physics-Guided Inference Network (SPIN), a novel framework designed for inductive spatiotemporal kriging. Unlike conventional approaches, SPIN synergistically integrates domain knowledge into deep learning by explicitly modeling physical advection and diffusion processes via parallel graph kernels. Crucially, we introduce a paradigm-shifting training strategy: rather than using error-prone AOD as a direct input, we repurpose it as a spatial gradient constraint within the loss function. This allows the model to learn structural pollution patterns from satellite data while remaining robust to data voids. Validated in the highly polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas (BTHSA), SPIN achieves a new state-of-the-art with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.52 ug/m^3, effectively generating continuous, physically plausible pollution fields even in unmonitored areas. This work provides a robust, low-cost, and all-weather solution for fine-grained environmental management.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of reasoning and generation tasks. However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results show that a finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model produced by CARE significantly outperforms both traditional causal-discovery algorithms and state-of-the-art LLMs with over a thousand times more parameters, demonstrating effective utilization of its own knowledge and the external algorithmic clues.

Conclusion: HGCN2SP是解决两阶段随机规划问题的有效模型，具有良好的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) is a standard framework for modeling decision-making problems under uncertainty. While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.

Conclusion: Agent0框架能在无外部数据下有效进化高性能代理，提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents, often trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), are constrained by a dependency on human-curated data, limiting scalability and tethering AI to human knowledge. Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 引入两子空间径向激活 (TSRAs) 实现基于基变换 (CoB) 的剪枝，虽有精度下降但 CoB+TSRA 框架在 VGG - 16 上有不错结果，表明旋转不变架构对 CoB 剪枝有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准深度学习架构对正交线性变换不具有内在不变性，为使 CoB 剪枝兼容这些架构。

Method: 引入两子空间径向激活 (TSRAs)，其在两个激活子空间内对正交线性变换具有不变性，可将 CoB 变换合并到周围权重中。

Result: 与基于 ReLU 的对照相比有 4.52% 的精度下降；在 VGG - 16 上，固定比例剪枝时 CoB 提高精度并扩展可靠剪枝边界，阈值剪枝策略下可剪枝 90 - 96% 参数且微调后精度下降 1 - 6%。

Conclusion: 旋转不变架构为 CoB 剪枝提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Structured pruning removes entire neurons or channels, but its effectiveness depends on how importance is distributed across the representation space. Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\%$ to $70\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on homophilous graphs but often fail under heterophily due to self-reinforcing and phase-inconsistent signals. We propose a Gauge-Equivariant Graph Network with Self-Interference Cancellation (GESC), which replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism. Unlike prior magnetic or gauge-equivariant GNNs that typically focus on phase handling in spectral filtering while largely relying on scalar weighting, GESC introduces a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ phase connection followed by a rank-1 projection that attenuates self-parallel components before attention. A sign- and phase-aware gate further regulates neighbor influence, attenuating components aligned with current node states and acting as a local notch on low-frequency modes. Across diverse graph benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while offering a unified, interference-aware view of message passing. Our code is available at \href{here}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GESC-1B22}.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中 LoRA 在客户端异构性下面临的初始化不稳定、秩不兼容和聚合误差、非独立同分布数据下客户端漂移等问题。

Method: 提出 ILoRA 框架，包含基于 QR 的正交初始化、串联 QR 聚合机制、带秩感知控制变量的 AdamW 优化器。

Result: 在视觉和 NLP 基准测试上的实验表明，ILoRA 相比现有联邦 LoRA 方法，始终能实现更高的准确率和收敛稳定性。

Conclusion: ILoRA 框架有效解决了联邦学习中 LoRA 在客户端异构性下的问题，具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) faces three critical challenges under client heterogeneity: (1) Initialization-Induced Instability due to random initialization misaligning client subspaces; (2) Rank Incompatibility and Aggregation Error when averaging LoRA parameters of different ranks, which biases the global model; and (3) exacerbated Client Drift under Non-IID Data, impairing generalization. To address these challenges, we propose ILoRA, a unified framework that integrates three core innovations: a QR-based orthonormal initialization to ensure all clients start in a coherent subspace; a Concatenated QR Aggregation mechanism that fuses heterogeneous-rank updates via concatenation and decomposition, preserving information while maintaining dimension alignment; and an AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates to correct local updates and mitigate client drift. Supported by theoretical convergence guarantees, extensive experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks demonstrate that ILoRA consistently achieves superior accuracy and convergence stability compared to existing federated LoRA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统申请人跟踪系统（ATS）是不灵活的关键词匹配器，会因语义不匹配拒绝有能力的候选人，需要设计更精细的简历评估模型。

Method: 采用两步流程，先用监督微调（SFT）构建基线模型，再用 GRPO 在多组件奖励函数引导下通过强化学习（RL）优化 SFT 模型，反复优化奖励函数和训练超参数。

Result: GRPO 优化后的模型在未见测试数据上最终准确率达 91%，召回率 0.85，精度 1.0。

Conclusion: 正确执行的两步微调程序能有效优化小语言模型，实现精细且类似人类的候选人评分。

Abstract: Conventional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) tend to be inflexible keyword-matchers, and deny gifted candidates a role due to a few minor semantic mismatches. This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable "gentle polishing process" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.

Motivation: 解决谱GNN如ChebyNet受异质性和过平滑问题的局限。

Method: 引入[-1, 1]域的L - JacobiNet和S - JacobiNet模型，并与[0, +∞)域的AOPF模型对比分析。

Result: [0, +∞)域更适合建模异质性，[-1, 1]域在高K时数值稳定性好；ChebyNet主要问题是稳定性；S - JacobiNet在4/5基准数据集上优于L - JacobiNet。

Conclusion: S - JacobiNet是强大且被忽视的基线，[-1, 1]域的自适应可能导致过拟合。

Abstract: Spectral GNNs, like ChebyNet, are limited by heterophily and over-smoothing due to their static, low-pass filter design. This work investigates the "Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models in drug discovery is highly dependent on the quality and consistency of the underlying training data. Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments. We perform experiments on two common machine learning architectures and see increased prediction capability over a strong language-only baseline for 9/12 model-target pairs. AssayMatch provides a data-driven mechanism to curate higher-quality datasets, reducing noise from incompatible experiments and improving the predictive power and data efficiency of models for drug discovery.

Abstract: Deterministic policy gradient algorithms for continuous control suffer from value estimation biases that degrade performance. While double critics reduce such biases, the exploration potential of double actors remains underexplored. Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating the value of tunable bias and revealing that both overestimation and underestimation can be exploited differently depending on the environment.

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks offer a principled approach to graph filtering but face a fundamental "Stability-vs-Adaptivity" trade-off. This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a "naive" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as "Instability Poisoning," where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses "Late Fusion" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.

Abstract: Trajectory generation has recently drawn growing interest in privacy-preserving urban mobility studies and location-based service applications. Although many studies have used deep learning or generative AI methods to model trajectories and have achieved promising results, the robustness and interpretability of such models are largely unexplored. This limits the application of trajectory generation algorithms on noisy real-world data and their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset. The conditional version of our model can also be used to generate customized trajectories based on temporal and spatial constraints.
  Our model can effectively learn data distribution even using noisy data, achieving relative improvements of $35.4\%$ and $26.3\%$ over strong baselines on two real-world trajectory datasets. Moreover, the generated trajectories can be conveniently utilized for multiple downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction and data denoising. Lastly, the framework design offers a significant efficiency advantage, saving $64.8\%$ of the time and $56.5\%$ of GPU memory compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from social media is critical for understanding public sentiment, but accessing training data has become prohibitively expensive due to escalating API costs and platform restrictions. We introduce an interpretability-guided framework where Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provide principled guidance for LLM-based synthetic data generation. With sufficient seed data, SHAP-guided approach matches real data performance, significantly outperforms naïve generation, and substantially improves classification for underrepresented emotion classes. However, our linguistic analysis reveals that synthetic text exhibits reduced vocabulary richness and fewer personal or temporally complex expressions than authentic posts. This work provides both a practical framework for responsible synthetic data generation and a critical perspective on its limitations, underscoring that the future of trustworthy AI depends on navigating the trade-offs between synthetic utility and real-world authenticity.

Conclusion: 时间序列异常检测研究应从算法复杂性转向以数据为中心，强调标签利用。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical data mining task often constrained by label scarcity. Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions. However, this approach often overlooks the significant performance gains available from limited anomaly labels achievable in practical scenarios. This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts. These findings advocate for a data-centric shift in TSAD research, emphasizing label utilization over purely algorithmic complexity.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, balancing supply and demand, and market risk management. Even though short-term weather forecasts have been thoroughly used to provide short-term renewable power predictions, forecasts involving longer prediction horizons still need investigations. Despite the recent progress in subseasonal-to-seasonal weather probabilistic forecasting, their use for wind power prediction usually involves both temporal and spatial aggregation achieve reasonable skill. In this study, we present a forecasting pipeline enabling to transform ECMWF subseasonal-to-seasonal weather forecasts into wind power forecasts for lead times ranging from 1 day to 46 days at daily resolution. This framework also include post-processing of the resulting power ensembles to account for the biases and lack of dispersion of the weather forecasts. We show that our method is able to outperform a climatological baseline by 50 % in terms of both Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score and Ensemble Mean Squared Error while also providing near perfect calibration of the forecasts for lead times ranging from 15 to 46 days.

Abstract: Rumor detection on social media remains a challenging task due to the complex propagation dynamics and the limited interpretability of existing models. While recent neural architectures capture content and structural features, they often fail to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms of misinformation spread. We propose CausalMamba, a novel framework that integrates Mamba-based sequence modeling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and differentiable causal discovery via NOTEARS. CausalMamba learns joint representations of temporal tweet sequences and reply structures, while uncovering latent causal graphs to identify influential nodes within each propagation chain. Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show that our model achieves competitive classification performance compared to strong baselines, and uniquely enables counterfactual intervention analysis. Qualitative results demonstrate that removing top-ranked causal nodes significantly alters graph connectivity, offering interpretable insights into rumor dynamics. Our framework provides a unified approach for rumor classification and influence analysis, paving the way for more explainable and actionable misinformation detection systems.

Conclusion: 半信任切换框架和随机算法有效解决了学习增强环境下的在线区间调度问题。

Abstract: We study online interval scheduling in the irrevocable setting, where each interval must be immediately accepted or rejected upon arrival. The objective is to maximize the total length of accepted intervals while ensuring that no two accepted intervals overlap. We consider this problem in a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to (machine-learned) predictions. The goal is to design algorithms that leverage these predictions to improve performance while maintaining robust guarantees in the presence of prediction errors.
  Our main contribution is the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework, which provides a unified approach for combining prediction-based and classical interval scheduling algorithms. This framework applies to both deterministic and randomized algorithms and captures the trade-off between consistency (performance under accurate predictions) and robustness (performance under adversarial inputs). Moreover, we provide lower bounds, proving the tightness of this framework in particular settings.
  We further design a randomized algorithm that smoothly interpolates between prediction-based and robust algorithms. This algorithm achieves both robustness and smoothness--its performance degrades gracefully with the quality of the prediction.

One such domain is recruitment, where publicly available datasets are scarce due to the sensitive nature of information typically found in curricula vitae, such as gender, disability status, or age. %
This lack of accessible, representative data presents a significant obstacle to the development of fair and transparent machine learning models, particularly ranking algorithms that require large volumes of data to effectively learn how to recommend candidates. In the absence of such data, these models are prone to poor generalisation and may fail to perform reliably in real-world scenarios. %
Recent advances in Causal Generative Models (CGMs) offer a promising solution. CGMs enable the generation of synthetic datasets that preserve the underlying causal relationships within the data, providing greater control over fairness and interpretability in the data generation process. %
In this study, we present a specialised SDG method involving two CGMs: one modelling job offers and the other modelling curricula. Each model is structured according to a causal graph informed by domain expertise. We use these models to generate synthetic datasets and evaluate the fairness of candidate rankings under controlled scenarios that introduce specific biases.

Abstract: Deep generative modeling provides a powerful pathway to overcome data scarcity in energy-related applications where experimental data are often limited, costly, or difficult to obtain. By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.

Result: DirPA能成功移动决策边界，作为动态特征正则化器稳定训练过程。

Conclusion: DirPA方法可有效解决训练与测试标签分布不匹配问题，提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Real-world agricultural distributions often suffer from severe class imbalance, typically following a long-tailed distribution. Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain. When working with such limited data, training sets are frequently constructed to be artificially balanced -- in particular in the case of few-shot learning -- failing to reflect real-world conditions. This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training. Specifically, we model the real-world distribution as Dirichlet-distributed random variables, effectively performing a prior augmentation during few-shot learning. Our experiments show that DirPA successfully shifts the decision boundary and stabilizes the training process by acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.

Conclusion: 所提出的通信延迟感知框架能实现鲁棒的实时推理，可更精细地控制精度 - 延迟权衡。

Abstract: Connected cyber-physical systems perform inference based on real-time inputs from multiple data streams. Uncertain communication delays across data streams challenge the temporal flow of the inference process. State-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference methods rely on a reference-modality paradigm, requiring one modality input to be fully received before processing, while depending on costly offline profiling. We propose a novel, neuro-inspired non-blocking inference paradigm that primarily employs adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to stochastic delay patterns across heterogeneous streams while relaxing the reference-modality requirement. Our communication-delay-aware framework achieves robust real-time inference with finer-grained control over the accuracy-latency tradeoff. Experiments on the audio-visual event localization (AVEL) task demonstrate superior adaptability to network dynamics compared to SotA approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of a two-player zero-sum game. In the literature, the successive over-relaxation Q-learning algorithm has been developed and implemented, and it is seen to result in a lower contraction factor for the associated Q-Bellman operator resulting in a faster value iteration-based procedure. However, this has been presented only for the tabular case and not for the setting with function approximation that typically caters to real-world high-dimensional state-action spaces. Furthermore, such settings in the case of two-player zero-sum games have not been considered. We thus propose a deep successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm that incorporates deep neural networks as function approximators and is suitable for high-dimensional spaces. We prove the finite-time convergence of the proposed algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing Q-learning algorithm. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effect of different values of the crucial successive over-relaxation parameter.

Result: 发现pass@k目标在探索关键阶段学习信号消失，随着策略集中概率质量，pass@k和pass@1差距减小。

Conclusion: pass@k是有用的诊断工具，但不适合作为直接优化目标，应采用鼓励有效探索的机制。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex, multi-step reasoning is a central focus of modern AI research. To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of "exploration collapse", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Trajectory similarity retrieval is an important part of spatiotemporal data mining, however, existing methods have the following limitations: traditional metrics are computationally expensive, while learning-based methods suffer from substantial training costs and potential instability. This paper addresses these problems by proposing \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{P}rototype \textbf{T}rajectory \textbf{H}ashing (GeoPTH), a novel, lightweight, and non-learning framework for efficient category-based trajectory retrieval. GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, \textit{Hausdorff} metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings. Critically, GeoPTH consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency. Our work demonstrates that a lightweight, prototype-centric approach offers a practical and powerful alternative, achieving an exceptional retrieval performance and computational efficiency.

Result: 方法能可靠地为离散分类目标和连续属性生成分布内且结构差异最小的反事实。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在图数据反事实解释方面有效。

Abstract: Machine learning models that operate on graph-structured data, such as molecular graphs or social networks, often make accurate predictions but offer little insight into why certain predictions are made. Counterfactual explanations address this challenge by seeking the closest alternative scenario where the model's prediction would change. Although counterfactual explanations are extensively studied in tabular data and computer vision, the graph domain remains comparatively underexplored. Constructing graph counterfactuals is intrinsically difficult because graphs are discrete and non-euclidean objects. We introduce Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation, a novel framework for generating counterfactual explanations on graph data, combining discrete diffusion models and classifier-free guidance. We empirically demonstrate that our method reliably generates in-distribution as well as minimally structurally different counterfactuals for both discrete classification targets and continuous properties.

Abstract: Optimal operation of chemical processes is vital for energy, resource, and cost savings in chemical engineering. The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Conclusion: 现代学习机制可作为传统观测器设计的有力补充，在不确定系统中实现更准确和鲁棒的状态估计。

Abstract: This work introduces a learning-enhanced observer (LEO) for linear time-invariant systems with uncertain dynamics. Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems.

Abstract: Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown promise across various financial applications, yet their effectiveness for corporate bankruptcy prediction remains systematically unevaluated against established methods. We study bankruptcy forecasting using Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and TabPFN, evaluated on large, highly imbalanced datasets of over one million company records from the Visegrád Group. We provide the first systematic comparison of foundation models against classical machine learning baselines for this task. Our results show that models such as XGBoost and CatBoost consistently outperform foundation models across all prediction horizons. LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable probability estimates, undermining their use in risk-sensitive financial settings. TabPFN, while competitive with simpler baselines, requires substantial computational resources with costs not justified by performance gains. These findings suggest that, despite their generality, current foundation models remain less effective than specialized methods for bankruptcy forecasting.

Abstract: Wearable sensor technologies and deep learning are transforming healthcare management. Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective. This study contributes to health information systems by offering a computational solution for integrated physical and mental healthcare and provides design principles for advancing collaborative chronic disease management across the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment phases.

Conclusion: FreqFlow框架在MTS预测中有效，能解决现有模型的不足。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting is fundamental to applications ranging from urban mobility and resource management to climate modeling. While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic speed, volume, and flow datasets demonstrate that FreqFlow achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, on average 7\% RMSE improvements, while being significantly faster and more parameter-efficient than existing methods

Abstract: Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: 序列建模方法更适合奖励结构不确定或数据质量混合的场景，价值基方法在密集奖励和高质量演示的环境中仍具竞争力。

Abstract: The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.

Abstract: Scalarisation functions are widely employed in MORL algorithms to enable intelligent decision-making. However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front. These functions often fail to retain the solutions uncovered during learning and favour finding solutions in certain regions of the solution space. Moreover, finding the appropriate weight configurations to sample the entire Pareto front is complex, limiting their applicability in uncertain settings. In contrast, inner-loop multi-policy algorithms may provide a more sustainable and generalizable approach and potentially facilitate intelligent decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.

Conclusion: LLM引导的奖励设计可用于生成有效的网络防御策略。

Abstract: Designing rewards for autonomous cyber attack and defense learning agents in a complex, dynamic environment is a challenging task for subject matter experts. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.

Abstract: In recent years, increasingly large models have achieved outstanding performance across CV tasks. However, these models demand substantial computational resources and storage, and their growing complexity limits our understanding of how they make decisions. Most of these architectures rely on the attention mechanism within Transformer-based designs. Building upon the connection between residual neural networks and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce ODE-ViT, a Vision Transformer reformulated as an ODE system that satisfies the conditions for well-posed and stable dynamics. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE. This strategy improves performance by more than 10% compared to training a free ODE-ViT from scratch.

Motivation: 现有检测训练数据标签错误的方法需对标签错误有鲁棒性的模型，获取此类模型有挑战，调整损失函数有改进机会。

Method: 受Focal Loss启发，提出两种新的损失函数，对难分类样本去权重或忽略。

Result: 在人工损坏数据上，检测错误的F1分数相比传统分类交叉熵和Focal Loss基线有所提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的两种新损失函数在检测训练数据标签错误方面有应用前景。

Abstract: Methods for detecting label errors in training data require models that are robust to label errors (i.e., not fit to erroneously labelled data points). However, acquiring such models often involves training on corrupted data, which presents a challenge. Adjustments to the loss function present an opportunity for improvement. Motivated by Focal Loss (which emphasizes difficult-to-classify samples), two novel, yet simple, loss functions are proposed that de-weight or ignore these difficult samples (i.e., those likely to have label errors). Results on artificially corrupted data show promise, such that F1 scores for detecting errors are improved from the baselines of conventional categorical Cross Entropy and Focal Loss.

Abstract: Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.

Result: 发现动态参与下FL模型性能显著下降，KPFL能提高模型鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 动态参与对FL性能有重大影响，KPFL能有效改善模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a shared model in a distributed manner, setting it apart from traditional deep learning paradigms. However, most existing FL research assumes consistent client participation, overlooking the practical scenario of dynamic participation (DPFL), where clients may intermittently join or leave during training. Moreover, no existing benchmarking framework systematically supports the study of DPFL-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients. KPFL leverages dual-age and data-bias weighting, combined with generative knowledge distillation, to mitigate instability and prevent knowledge loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant impact of dynamic participation on FL performance and the effectiveness of KPFL in improving model robustness and generalization.

Result: 所提方法优于传统LRF方法和现有公平性增强技术，消融研究探究了主要超参数对处理后模型性能的影响。

Conclusion: 这是首次利用SVD进行公平性增强而非主要用于模型压缩的工作。

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) techniques become integral to various applications, ensuring model fairness while maintaining high performance has become increasingly critical, particularly in sensitive fields such as medical diagnosis. Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing SVD not primarily for compression but for fairness enhancement.

Conclusion: BSCRLS算法能解决BRLS通用逼近性质局限问题，具有有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Universal approximation serves as the foundation of neural network learning algorithms. However, some networks establish their universal approximation property by demonstrating that the iterative errors converge in probability measure rather than the more rigorous norm convergence, which makes the universal approximation property of randomized learning networks highly sensitive to random parameter selection, Broad residual learning system (BRLS), as a member of randomized learning models, also encounters this issue. We theoretically demonstrate the limitation of its universal approximation property, that is, the iterative errors do not satisfy norm convergence if the selection of random parameters is inappropriate and the convergence rate meets certain conditions. To address this issue, we propose the broad stochastic configuration residual learning system (BSCRLS) algorithm, which features a novel supervisory mechanism adaptively constraining the range settings of random parameters on the basis of BRLS framework, Furthermore, we prove the universal approximation theorem of BSCRLS based on the more stringent norm convergence. Three versions of incremental BSCRLS algorithms are presented to satisfy the application requirements of various network updates. Solar panels dust detection experiments are performed on publicly available dataset and compared with 13 deep and broad learning algorithms. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness and superiority of BSCRLS algorithms.

Conclusion: 潜在空间、树驱动扩散是处理严重类别不平衡下表格数据增强的高效且注重隐私的方法。

Abstract: Severe class imbalance is common in real-world tabular learning, where rare but important minority classes are essential for reliable prediction. Existing generative oversampling methods such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can improve minority-class performance, but they often struggle with tabular heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy concerns. We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance.

Result: 证明DP - SGD在非凸和强凸设置下几乎必然收敛，动量变体有类似保证。

Conclusion: 为差分隐私优化提供更强理论基础，算法在凸和非凸状态下路径稳定。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has become the standard algorithm for training machine learning models with rigorous privacy guarantees. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privacy-induced distortions, the algorithm remains pathwise stable in both convex and nonconvex regimes.

Abstract: Palpation, the use of touch in medical examination, is almost exclusively performed by humans. We investigate a proof of concept for an artificial palpation method based on self-supervised learning. Our key idea is that an encoder-decoder framework can learn a $\textit{representation}$ from a sequence of tactile measurements that contains all the relevant information about the palpated object. We conjecture that such a representation can be used for downstream tasks such as tactile imaging and change detection. With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We collect palpation sequences using a robot equipped with a tactile sensor, and train a model that predicts sensory readings at different positions on the object. We investigate the representation learned in this process, and demonstrate its use in imaging and change detection.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.

Conclusion: EGGROLL算法有效克服了传统ES算法的瓶颈，在多种场景有良好表现。

Abstract: We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times r},\ B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ with $r\ll \min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.

Abstract: Large-scale neuromorphic architectures consist of computing tiles that communicate spikes using a shared interconnect. The communication patterns in these systems are inherently sparse, asynchronous, and localized, as neural activity is characterized by temporal sparsity with occasional bursts of high traffic. These characteristics require optimized interconnects to handle high-activity bursts while consuming minimal power during idle periods. Among the proposed interconnect solutions, the dynamic segmented bus has gained attention due to its structural simplicity, scalability, and energy efficiency. Since the benefits of a dynamic segmented bus stem from its simplicity, it is essential to develop a streamlined control plane that can scale efficiently with the network. In this paper, we present a design methodology for a scenario-aware control plane tailored to a segmented ladder bus, with the aim of minimizing control overhead and optimizing energy and area utilization. We evaluated our approach using a combination of FPGA implementation and software simulation to assess scalability. The results demonstrated that our design process effectively reduces the control plane's area footprint compared to the data plane while maintaining scalability with network size.

Abstract: Imminent radio telescope observatories provide massive data rates making deep learning based processing appealing while simultaneously demanding real-time performance at low-energy; prohibiting the use of many artificial neural network based approaches. We begin tackling the scientifically existential challenge of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection by deploying deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware. Our approach partitions large, pre-trained networks onto SynSense Xylo hardware using maximal splitting, a novel greedy algorithm. We validate this pipeline with on-chip power measurements, achieving instrument-scaled inference at 100mW. While our full-scale SNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among SNN baselines, our experiments reveal a more important insight that a smaller un-partitioned model significantly outperforms larger, split models. This finding highlights that hardware co-design is paramount for optimal performance. Our work thus provides a practical deployment blueprint, a key insight into the challenges of model scaling, and reinforces radio astronomy as a demanding yet ideal domain for advancing applied neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: Customized static operator design has enabled widespread application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but their search performance is transient during iterations and prone to degradation. Dynamic operators aim to address this but typically rely on predefined designs and localized parameter control during the search process, lacking adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for Evolutionary Optimization (LLM4EO), comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, initialization of operators is performed by transferring the strengths of classical operators via LLMs. Then, search preferences and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance and evolutionary features, accompanied by corresponding suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, gene selection priorities of operators are dynamically optimized via improvement prompting strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of populations and operators in the search, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, a series of validations on multiple benchmark datasets of the flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms both mainstream evolutionary programming and traditional EAs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Quality Engineering (QE) by automating the generation of artefacts such as requirements, test cases, and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) scenarios. However, ensuring the quality of these outputs remains a challenge. This paper presents a systematic technique to baseline and evaluate QE artefacts using quantifiable metrics. The approach combines LLM-driven generation, reverse generation , and iterative refinement guided by rubrics technique for clarity, completeness, consistency, and testability. Experimental results across 12 projects show that reverse-generated artefacts can outperform low-quality inputs and maintain high standards when inputs are strong. The framework enables scalable, reliable QE artefact validation, bridging automation with accountability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有APR基准主要关注用户空间应用，忽视内核空间调试和修复的复杂性，此前内核APR工作成功率低且依赖复杂昂贵基础设施。

Method: 引入RGym框架，构建基于RGym的APR管道，利用专门定位技术，克服KGym中不切实际的预言机使用。

Result: 在143个漏洞数据集测试，GPT - 5 Thinking通过率达43.36%，每个漏洞成本低于0.2美元。

Conclusion: 提出的定位策略、提示结构和模型选择有贡献，基于反馈的重试可显著提高成功率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated program repair (APR) but current benchmarks like SWE-Bench predominantly focus on userspace applications and overlook the complexities of kernel-space debugging and repair. The Linux kernel poses unique challenges due to its monolithic structure, concurrency, and low-level hardware interactions. Prior efforts such as KGym and CrashFixer have highlighted the difficulty of APR in this domain, reporting low success rates or relying on costly and complex pipelines and pricey cloud infrastructure. In this work, we introduce RGym, a lightweight, platform-agnostic APR evaluation framework for the Linux kernel designed to operate on local commodity hardware. Built on RGym, we propose a simple yet effective APR pipeline leveraging specialized localization techniques (e.g., call stacks and blamed commits) to overcome the unrealistic usage of oracles in KGym. We test on a filtered and verified dataset of 143 bugs. Our method achieves up to a 43.36% pass rate with GPT-5 Thinking while maintaining a cost of under $0.20 per bug. We further conduct an ablation study to analyze contributions from our proposed localization strategy, prompt structure, and model choice, and demonstrate that feedback-based retries can significantly enhance success rates.

Result: 提示设计和架构选择对代码异味倾向起决定性作用，且PSC有助于开发者解释模型行为和评估代码质量。

Conclusion: 研究为将质量感知评估融入大语言模型代码评估和部署奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code.
  This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.

Method: 提出AI驱动的事件编排框架，采用机器学习触发器、异常检测和流程挖掘分析。

Result: 多组织案例分析表明在流程效率、成本可见性和决策准确性方面有可衡量的提升。

Conclusion: 在Workday基于事件的架构中嵌入AI能力可增强运营弹性、治理和可扩展性，为医疗企业自动化策略提供参考。

Abstract: The adoption of cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms such as Workday has transformed healthcare operations by integrating financial, supply-chain, and workforce processes into a unified ecosystem. However, traditional workflow logic in ERP systems often lacks the adaptability required to manage event-driven and data-intensive healthcare environments.
  This study proposes an AI-enabled event-driven orchestration framework within Workday ERP that intelligently synchronizes financial and supply-chain workflows across distributed healthcare entities. The framework employs machine-learning triggers, anomaly detection, and process mining analytics to anticipate and automate responses to operational events such as inventory depletion, payment delays, or patient demand fluctuations. A multi-organization case analysis demonstrates measurable gains in process efficiency, cost visibility, and decision accuracy.
  Results confirm that embedding AI capabilities into Workday's event-based architecture enhances operational resilience, governance, and scalability. The proposed model contributes to the broader understanding of intelligent ERP integration and establishes a reference for next-generation automation strategies in healthcare enterprises.

Abstract: High-quality data annotation requirements are crucial for the development of safe and reliable AI-enabled perception systems (AIePS) in autonomous driving. Although these requirements play a vital role in reducing bias and enhancing performance, their formulation and management remain underexplored, leading to inconsistencies, safety risks, and regulatory concerns. Our study investigates how annotation requirements are defined and used in practice, the challenges in ensuring their quality, practitioner-recommended improvements, and their impact on AIePS development and performance. We conducted $19$ semi-structured interviews with participants from six international companies and four research organisations. Our thematic analysis reveals five main key challenges: ambiguity, edge case complexity, evolving requirements, inconsistencies, and resource constraints and three main categories of best practices, including ensuring compliance with ethical standards, improving data annotation requirements guidelines, and embedded quality assurance for data annotation requirements. We also uncover critical interrelationships between annotation requirements, annotation practices, annotated data quality, and AIePS performance and development, showing how requirement flaws propagate through the AIePS development pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to offer empirically grounded guidance on improving annotation requirements, offering actionable insights to enhance annotation quality, regulatory compliance, and system reliability. It also contributes to the emerging fields of Software Engineering (SE for AI) and Requirements Engineering (RE for AI) by bridging the gap between RE and AI in a timely and much-needed manner.

Result: 在SWE - bench Lite和SWE - bench Verified上实验，InfCode始终优于强基线模型，在SWE - bench Verified上达到79.4%的性能，创最新水平。

Conclusion: InfCode能有效解决仓库级软件问题，具有良好性能，并已开源。

Abstract: Large language models have advanced software engineering automation, yet resolving real-world software issues remains difficult because it requires repository-level reasoning, accurate diagnostics, and strong verification signals. Existing agent-based and pipeline-based methods often rely on insufficient tests, which can lead to patches that satisfy verification but fail to fix the underlying defect. We present InfCode, an adversarial multi-agent framework for automated repository-level issue resolution. InfCode iteratively refines both tests and patches through adversarial interaction between a Test Patch Generator and a Code Patch Generator, while a Selector agent identifies the most reliable fix. The framework runs inside a containerized environment that supports realistic repository inspection, modification, and validation. Experiments on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified using models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show that InfCode consistently outperforms strong baselines. It achieves 79.4% performance on SWE-bench Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art. We have released InfCode as an open-source project at https://github.com/Tokfinity/InfCode.

Result: 在MultiSWE - bench - CPP基准测试中，INFCODE - C++解决率达25.58%，优于先前最强代理10.85个百分点，是MSWE - agent性能的两倍多。

Conclusion: 强调多语言软件代理中语言感知推理的必要性，为复杂静态类型生态系统的LLM驱动修复研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong performance on repository-level issue resolution, but existing systems are almost exclusively designed for Python and rely heavily on lexical retrieval and shallow code navigation. These approaches transfer poorly to C++ projects, where overloaded identifiers, nested namespaces, template instantiations, and deep control-flow structures make context retrieval and fault localization substantially more difficult. As a result, state-of-the-art Python-oriented agents show a drastic performance drop on the C++ subset of MultiSWE-bench. We introduce INFCODE-C++, the first C++-aware autonomous system for end-to-end issue resolution. The system combines two complementary retrieval mechanisms -- semantic code-intent retrieval and deterministic AST-structured querying -- to construct accurate, language-aware context for repair.These components enable precise localization and robust patch synthesis in large, statically typed C++ repositories. Evaluated on the \texttt{MultiSWE-bench-CPP} benchmark, INFCODE-C++ achieves a resolution rate of 25.58\%, outperforming the strongest prior agent by 10.85 percentage points and more than doubling the performance of MSWE-agent. Ablation and behavioral studies further demonstrate the critical role of semantic retrieval, structural analysis, and accurate reproduction in C++ issue resolution. INFCODE-C++ highlights the need for language-aware reasoning in multi-language software agents and establishes a foundation for future research on scalable, LLM-driven repair for complex, statically typed ecosystems.

Abstract: Textual Vulnerability Descriptions (TVDs) are crucial for security analysts to understand and address software vulnerabilities. However, the key aspect inconsistencies in TVDs from different repositories pose challenges for achieving a comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities. Existing approaches aim to mitigate inconsistencies by aligning TVDs with external knowledge bases, but they often discard valuable information and fail to synthesize comprehensive representations. In this paper, we propose a domain-constrained LLM-based synthesis framework for unifying key aspects of TVDs. Our framework consists of three stages: 1) Extraction, guided by rule-based templates to ensure all critical details are captured; 2) Self-evaluation, using domain-specific anchor words to assess semantic variability across sources; and 3) Fusion, leveraging information entropy to reconcile inconsistencies and prioritize relevant details. This framework improves synthesis performance, increasing the F1 score for key aspect augmentation from 0.82 to 0.87, while enhancing comprehension and efficiency by over 30\%. We further develop Digest Labels, a practical tool for visualizing TVDs, which human evaluations show significantly boosts usability.

Result: 大语言模型生成的代码语义相似度高，但功能正确性低，仅20% - 26%的零样本生成代码在测试中与真实实现行为相同；生成代码复杂度和gas消耗更低，常因省略验证逻辑；检索增强生成显著提升性能，功能正确性最高可提升45%，代码更简洁高效。

Conclusion: 大语言模型生成的智能合约代码语义相似度和功能合理性存在显著差距，检索增强生成虽有效，但生成可靠的生产级代码仍面临重大挑战，需专家仔细验证。

Abstract: Smart Contracts are critical components of blockchain ecosystems, with Solidity as the dominant programming language. While LLMs excel at general-purpose code generation, the unique constraints of Smart Contracts, such as gas consumption, security, and determinism, raise open questions about the reliability of LLM-generated Solidity code. Existing studies lack a comprehensive evaluation of these critical functional and non-functional properties. We benchmark four state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and retrieval-augmented generation settings across 500 real-world functions. Our multi-faceted assessment employs code similarity metrics, semantic embeddings, automated test execution, gas profiling, and cognitive and cyclomatic complexity analysis. Results show that while LLMs produce code with high semantic similarity to real contracts, their functional correctness is low: only 20% to 26% of zero-shot generations behave identically to ground-truth implementations under testing. The generated code is consistently simpler, with significantly lower complexity and gas consumption, often due to omitted validation logic. Retrieval-Augmented Generation markedly improves performance, boosting functional correctness by up to 45% and yielding more concise and efficient code. Our findings reveal a significant gap between semantic similarity and functional plausibility in LLM-generated Smart Contracts. We conclude that while RAG is a powerful enhancer, achieving robust, production-ready code generation remains a substantial challenge, necessitating careful expert validation.

Abstract: Data annotation is essential but highly error-prone in the development of AI-enabled perception systems (AIePS) for automated driving, and its quality directly influences model performance, safety, and reliability. However, the industry lacks empirical insights into how annotation errors emerge and spread across the multi-organisational automotive supply chain. This study addresses this gap through a multi-organisation case study involving six companies and four research institutes across Europe and the UK. Based on 19 semi-structured interviews with 20 experts (50 hours of transcripts) and a six-phase thematic analysis, we develop a taxonomy of 18 recurring annotation error types across three data-quality dimensions: completeness (e.g., attribute omission, missing feedback loops, edge-case omissions, selection bias), accuracy (e.g., mislabelling, bounding-box inaccuracies, granularity mismatches, bias-driven errors), and consistency (e.g., inter-annotator disagreement, ambiguous instructions, misaligned hand-offs, cross-modality inconsistencies). The taxonomy was validated with industry practitioners, who reported its usefulness for root-cause analysis, supplier quality reviews, onboarding, and improving annotation guidelines. They described it as a failure-mode catalogue similar to FMEA. By conceptualising annotation quality as a lifecycle and supply-chain issue, this study contributes to SE4AI by offering a shared vocabulary, diagnostic toolset, and actionable guidance for building trustworthy AI-enabled perception systems.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.

Abstract: Binary options trading is often marketed as a field where predictive models can generate consistent profits. However, the inherent randomness and stochastic nature of binary options make price movements highly unpredictable, posing significant challenges for any forecasting approach. This study demonstrates that machine learning algorithms struggle to outperform a simple baseline in predicting binary options movements. Using a dataset of EUR/USD currency pairs from 2021 to 2023, we tested multiple models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), both before and after hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, several neural network architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, were evaluated under different training conditions. Despite these exhaustive efforts, none of the models surpassed the ZeroR baseline accuracy, highlighting the inherent randomness of binary options. These findings reinforce the notion that binary options lack predictable patterns, making them unsuitable for machine learning-based forecasting.

Conclusion: 此框架克服静态方法不足，为WUI火灾动态管理和主动防控决策提供更科学依据。

Abstract: Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) fires represent a compound disaster resulting from the interactions between natural ecosystems and human settlements, characterized by significantly dynamic evolving risks. However, most current risk assessment studies are based on static frameworks, which struggle to effectively capture the dynamic changes in risk over time. To address this issue, this paper proposes an innovative method that integrates a dynamic evaluation matrix, grey incidence analysis, and an optimization model for the dynamic risk assessment of WUI fires. This method incorporates time-series data by constructing a dynamic evaluation matrix, subsequently calculates the weighted standardized matrix for each evaluated area and its local volume matrices relative to the positive and negative ideal matrices. The dynamic differences between the evaluated areas and the ideal state are quantified by calculating the grey incidence degree, and an optimization model is established to solve for the superiority degree used for risk ranking. Research demonstrates that this method not only simplifies the computational process but also effectively captures the dynamic evolution patterns of fire risk across different areas, enabling refined risk classification. Compared to existing static methods, this framework overcomes their limitation in adequately representing risk dynamics, providing a more scientific basis for decision-making in the dynamic management and proactive prevention and control of WUI fires.

Abstract: In real-world applications, data often reside in restricted domains with unknown boundaries, or as high-dimensional point clouds lying on a lower-dimensional, nontrivial, unknown manifold. Traditional Gaussian Processes (GPs) struggle to capture the underlying geometry in such settings. Some existing methods assume a flat space embedded in a point cloud, which can be represented by a single latent chart (latent space), while others exhibit weak performance when the point cloud is sparse or irregularly sampled. The goal of this work is to address these challenges. The main contributions are twofold: (1) We establish the Atlas Brownian Motion (BM) framework for estimating the heat kernel on point clouds with unknown geometries and nontrivial topological structures; (2) Instead of directly using the heat kernel estimates, we construct a Riemannian corrected kernel by combining the global heat kernel with local RBF kernel and leading to the formulation of Riemannian-corrected Atlas Gaussian Processes (RC-AGPs). The resulting RC-AGPs are applied to regression tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets. These examples demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both heat kernel estimation and regression accuracy. It improves statistical inference by effectively bridging the gap between complex, high-dimensional observations and manifold-based inferences.

### [184] [Angular Graph Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16111)
*Feiyue Zhao,Yangfan He,Zhichao Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出角图分数阶傅里叶变换(AGFRFT)统一框架用于图信号处理，经理论分析和实验验证其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图分数阶傅里叶变换(GFRFT)缺乏角度调节和角图傅里叶变换(AGFT)退化缺陷的问题。

Method: 提出AGFRFT统一框架，定义两种变体，进行理论分析并支持可学习的联合参数化。

Result: AGFRFT在谱集中性、重建质量和可控谱操作方面优于GFRFT和AGFT。

Conclusion: AGFRFT为图信号处理中的集成角分数谱分析提供了强大而灵活的工具。

Abstract: Graph spectral representations are fundamental in graph signal processing, offering a rigorous framework for analyzing and processing graph-structured data. The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) extends the classical graph Fourier transform (GFT) with a fractional-order parameter, enabling flexible spectral analysis while preserving mathematical consistency. The angular graph Fourier transform (AGFT) introduces angular control via GFT eigenvector rotation; however, existing constructions fail to degenerate to the GFT at zero angle, which is a critical flaw that undermines theoretical consistency and interpretability. To resolve these complementary limitations - GFRFT's lack of angular regulation and AGFT's defective degeneracy - this study proposes an angular GFRFT (AGFRFT), a unified framework that integrates fractional-order and angular spectral analyses with theoretical rigor. A degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix family ensures exact GFT degeneration at zero angle, with two AGFRFT variants (I-AGFRFT and II-AGFRFT) defined accordingly. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm their unitarity, invertibility, and smooth parameter dependence. Both support learnable joint parameterization of the angle and fractional order, enabling adaptive spectral processing for diverse graph signals. Extensive experiments on real-world data denoising, image denoising, and point cloud denoising demonstrate that AGFRFT outperforms GFRFT and AGFT in terms of spectral concentration, reconstruction quality, and controllable spectral manipulation, establishing a robust and flexible tool for integrated angular fractional spectral analysis in graph signal processing.

TL;DR: 研究线性探针可靠性，提出光谱可识别性原理（SIP）解释现象，通过有限样本推理建立联系，合成研究验证预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性探针广泛用于解释和评估神经表征，但可靠性不明，在某些情况下表现不稳定。

Method: 揭示现象背后的光谱机制，提出光谱可识别性原理（SIP），通过有限样本推理连接特征间隙几何、样本大小和误分类风险。

Result: 当任务相关方向的特征间隙大于Fisher估计误差时，估计子空间集中且准确性一致；缩小间隙会以相变方式导致不稳定。合成研究证实了预测。

Conclusion: 所提出的分析提供了一种可解释的诊断方法，光谱检查可在不可靠探针扭曲下游评估前进行预判。

Abstract: Linear probes are widely used to interpret and evaluate neural representations, yet their reliability remains unclear, as probes may appear accurate in some regimes but collapse unpredictably in others. We uncover a spectral mechanism behind this phenomenon and formalize it as the Spectral Identifiability Principle (SIP), a verifiable Fisher-inspired condition for probe stability. When the eigengap separating task-relevant directions is larger than the Fisher estimation error, the estimated subspace concentrates and accuracy remains consistent, whereas closing this gap induces instability in a phase-transition manner. Our analysis connects eigengap geometry, sample size, and misclassification risk through finite-sample reasoning, providing an interpretable diagnostic rather than a loose generalization bound. Controlled synthetic studies, where Fisher quantities are computed exactly, confirm these predictions and show how spectral inspection can anticipate unreliable probes before they distort downstream evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 明确Generator Matching和Edit Flows中损失和参数化与状态和时间的关系，为实际中依赖时间的损失加权方案提供理论依据。

Method: 理论推导与分析。

Result: 证明了Bregman散度损失和生成器线性参数化可依赖当前状态和时间，时间期望可基于广泛时间分布；依赖时间的损失加权方案具有理论合理性；简化了$X_1$-预测器方案的构建。

Conclusion: 依赖时间的损失加权方案在Generator Matching或Edit Flows的特定情况中有理论依据，且依赖状态和时间的设置有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This brief note clarifies that, in Generator Matching (which subsumes a large family of flow matching and diffusion models over continuous, manifold, and discrete spaces), both the Bregman divergence loss and the linear parameterization of the generator can depend on both the current state $X_t$ and the time $t$, and we show that the expectation over time in the loss can be taken with respect to a broad class of time distributions. We also show this for Edit Flows, which falls outside of Generator Matching. That the loss can depend on $t$ clarifies that time-dependent loss weighting schemes, often used in practice to stabilize training, are theoretically justified when the specific flow or diffusion scheme is a special case of Generator Matching (or Edit Flows). It also often simplifies the construction of $X_1$-predictor schemes, which are sometimes preferred for model-related reasons. We show examples that rely upon the dependence of linear parameterizations, and of the Bregman divergence loss, on $t$ and $X_t$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前算法在对称k - 随机块模型社区检测中，达极小极大率要么计算效率低，要么需更强假设，需改进。

Method: 通过平方和框架强化多数投票，基于强化多数投票开发新图二分算法。

Result: 提出多项式时间算法，达极小极大最优误分类率，在有对手干扰节点时也适用。

Conclusion: 所提算法是首个在两种设置下接近KS阈值达到极小极大率的多项式时间算法，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: We study community detection in the \emph{symmetric $k$-stochastic block model}, where $n$ nodes are evenly partitioned into $k$ clusters with intra- and inter-cluster connection probabilities $p$ and $q$, respectively.
  Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax-optimal misclassification rate
  \begin{equation*}
  \exp \Bigl(-\bigl(1 \pm o(1)\bigr) \tfrac{C}{k}\Bigr),
  \quad \text{where } C = (\sqrt{pn} - \sqrt{qn})^2,
  \end{equation*}
  whenever $C \ge K\,k^2\,\log k$ for some universal constant $K$, matching the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold up to a $\log k$ factor.
  Notably, this rate holds even when an adversary corrupts an $η\le \exp\bigl(- (1 \pm o(1)) \tfrac{C}{k}\bigr)$ fraction of the nodes.
  To the best of our knowledge, the minimax rate was previously only attainable either via computationally inefficient procedures [ZZ15] or via polynomial-time algorithms that require strictly stronger assumptions such as $C \ge K k^3$ [GMZZ17].
  In the node-robust setting, the best known algorithm requires the substantially stronger condition $C \ge K k^{102}$ [LM22].
  Our results close this gap by providing the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax rate near the KS threshold in both settings.
  Our work has two key technical contributions:
  (1) we robustify majority voting via the Sum-of-Squares framework,
  (2) we develop a novel graph bisection algorithm via robust majority voting, which allows us to significantly improve the misclassification rate to $1/\mathrm{poly}(k)$ for the initial estimation near the KS threshold.

Motivation: 研究随机d - 正则图上固定磁化铁磁Ising模型的性质，验证相关猜想及分析动力学。

Method: 对固定磁化Ising模型进行理论分析，克服信念传播方程不稳定不动点问题。

Result: 自由能密度收敛到退火自由能密度，有局部弱收敛；证明Zdeborová - Boettcher猜想；确定大偏差率函数；证明Glauber动力学亚指数时间混合。

Conclusion: 在随机d - 正则图上固定磁化铁磁Ising模型有良好性质，可用于解决相关组合优化问题和动力学分析。

Abstract: We study the fixed-magnetization ferromagnetic Ising model on random $d$-regular graphs for $d\ge 3$ and inverse temperature below the tree reconstruction threshold. Our main result is that for each magnetization $η$, the free energy density of the fixed-magnetization Ising model converges to the annealed free energy density, itself the Bethe free energy of an Ising measure on the infinite $d$-regular tree. Moreover, the fixed-magnetization Ising model exhibits local weak convergence to this tree measure. A key challenge to proving these results is that for magnetizations between the model's spinodal points, the limiting tree measure corresponds to an unstable fixed point of the belief propagation equations.
  As an application, we prove that the positive-temperature Zdeborová--Boettcher conjecture on max-cut and min-bisection holds up to the reconstruction threshold: on the random $d$-regular graph, the expected fraction of bichromatic edges in the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model plus the expected fraction of bichromatic edges in the zero-magnetization ferromagnetic Ising model equals $1+o(1)$.
  A second application is completely determining the large deviation rate function for the magnetization in the Ising model on the random regular graph up to reconstruction.
  Finally, we use the precise understanding of this rate function to show that the Glauber dynamics for the full Ising model on the random graph mixes in sub-exponential time from uniformly random initialization, well into the non-uniqueness regime where the worst-case initialization mixing time is exponentially slow.

Method: 利用近期学术研究和现实区块链数据，从能源使用、安全性等七个关键指标对PoW和PoS进行综合对比分析。

Result: PoW安全但能耗高、吞吐量慢且易中心化；PoS可扩展性和效率高、环境影响小，但存在验证者中心化和长期安全成熟度问题。

Conclusion: 两种机制各有取舍，混合设计可结合PoW的安全性与PoS的效率和可持续性。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two dominant blockchain consensus mechanisms, Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), evaluated across seven critical metrics: energy use, security, transaction speed, scalability, centralization risk, environmental impact, and transaction fees. Utilizing recent academic research and real-world blockchain data, the study highlights that PoW offers robust, time-tested security but suffers from high energy consumption, slower throughput, and centralization through mining pools. In contrast, PoS demonstrates improved scalability and efficiency, significantly reduced environmental impact, and more stable transaction fees, however it raises concerns over validator centralization and long-term security maturity. The findings underscore the trade-offs inherent in each mechanism and suggest hybrid designs may combine PoW's security with PoS's efficiency and sustainability. The study aims to inform future blockchain infrastructure development by striking a balance between decentralization, performance, and ecological responsibility.

Conclusion: 该工作为安全、可审计和意图感知的自主经济代理奠定基础，推动AI金融生态实现可验证的信任和问责制。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are increasingly capable of initiating financial transactions on behalf of users or other agents. This evolution introduces a fundamental challenge: verifying both the authenticity of an autonomous agent and the true intent behind its transactions in a decentralized, trustless environment. Traditional payment systems assume human authorization, but autonomous, agent-led payments remove that safeguard. This paper presents a blockchain-based framework that cryptographically authenticates and verifies the intent of every AI-initiated transaction. The proposed system leverages decentralized identity (DID) standards and verifiable credentials to establish agent identities, on-chain intent proofs to record user authorization, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to preserve privacy while ensuring policy compliance. Additionally, secure execution environments (TEE-based attestations) guarantee the integrity of agent reasoning and execution. The hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture provides an immutable audit trail linking user intent to payment outcome. Through qualitative analysis, the framework demonstrates strong resistance to impersonation, unauthorized transactions, and misalignment of intent. This work lays the foundation for secure, auditable, and intent-aware autonomous economic agents, enabling a future of verifiable trust and accountability in AI-driven financial ecosystems.

Result: 平台让农民能轻松识别相似农民，研究人员可在不获取敏感信息情况下从数据中学习并开发工具。

Conclusion: 该平台弥合了保护农场数据隐私与利用数据解决全球粮食和农业挑战之间的差距。

Abstract: Digital agriculture is transforming the way we grow food by utilizing technology to make farming more efficient, sustainable, and productive. This modern approach to agriculture generates a wealth of valuable data that could help address global food challenges, but farmers are hesitant to share it due to privacy concerns. This limits the extent to which researchers can learn from this data to inform improvements in farming. This paper presents the Digital Agriculture Sandbox, a secure online platform that solves this problem. The platform enables farmers (with limited technical resources) and researchers to collaborate on analyzing farm data without exposing private information. We employ specialized techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and data analysis methods to safeguard the data while maintaining its utility for research purposes. The system enables farmers to identify similar farmers in a simplified manner without needing extensive technical knowledge or access to computational resources. Similarly, it enables researchers to learn from the data and build helpful tools without the sensitive information ever leaving the farmer's system. This creates a safe space where farmers feel comfortable sharing data, allowing researchers to make important discoveries. Our platform helps bridge the gap between maintaining farm data privacy and utilizing that data to address critical food and farming challenges worldwide.

We evaluate three defense mechanisms: content filtering with embedding-based anomaly detection, hierarchical system prompt guardrails, and multi-stage response verification, across seven state-of-the-art language models. Our combined framework reduces successful attack rates from 73.2% to 8.7% while maintaining 94.3% of baseline task performance. We release our benchmark dataset and defense implementation to support future research in AI agent security.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping offensive cybersecurity by enabling autonomous red team agents that can plan, execute, and adapt during penetration tests. However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command & control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive reconnaissance agents covertly across networks. Notably, we find that our architecture not only improves goal-directed behavior of the system as whole, but also eliminates key host and network artifacts that can be used to detect and prevent command & control behavior altogether. We begin with a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art generative red teaming methods, from fine-tuned specialist models to modular or agentic frameworks, analyzing their automation capabilities against task-specific accuracy. We then detail how our MCP-based C2 can overcome current limitations by enabling asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing without periodic beaconing. We furthermore explore advanced adversarial capabilities of this architecture, its detection-evasion techniques, and address dual-use ethical implications, proposing defensive measures and controlled evaluation in lab settings. Experimental comparisons with traditional C2 show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint. We conclude with future directions for integrating autonomous exploitation, defensive LLM agents, predictive evasive maneuvers, and multi-agent swarms. The proposed MCP-enabled C2 framework demonstrates a significant step toward realistic, AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced persistent threats while informing the development of next-generation defensive systems.

Abstract: As Law Enforcement Agencies advance in cryptocurrency forensics, criminal actors aiming to conceal illicit fund movements increasingly turn to "mixin" services or privacy-based cryptocurrencies. Monero stands out as a leading choice due to its strong privacy preserving and untraceability properties, making conventional blockchain analysis ineffective. Understanding the behavior and operational patterns of criminal actors within Monero is therefore challenging and it is essential to support future investigative strategies and disrupt illicit activities. In this work, we propose a case study in which we leverage a novel graph-based methodology to extract structural and temporal patterns from Monero transactions linked to already discovered criminal activities. By building Address-Ring-Transaction graphs from flagged transactions, we extract structural and temporal features and use them to train Machine Learning models capable of detecting similar behavioral patterns that could highlight criminal modus operandi. This represents a first partial step toward developing analytical tools that support investigative efforts in privacy-preserving blockchain ecosystems

Conclusion: FBTM方法有助于安全领导者做出明智决策，塑造更具弹性的未来安全态势。

Abstract: Traditional threat modeling remains reactive-focused on known TTPs and past incident data, while threat prediction and forecasting frameworks are often disconnected from operational or architectural artifacts. This creates a fundamental weakness: the most serious cyber threats often do not arise from what is known, but from what is assumed, overlooked, or not yet conceived, and frequently originate from the future, such as artificial intelligence, information warfare, and supply chain attacks, where adversaries continuously develop new exploits that can bypass defenses built on current knowledge. To address this mental gap, this paper introduces the theory and methodology of Future-Back Threat Modeling (FBTM). This predictive approach begins with envisioned future threat states and works backward to identify assumptions, gaps, blind spots, and vulnerabilities in the current defense architecture, providing a clearer and more accurate view of impending threats so that we can anticipate their emergence and shape the future we want through actions taken now. The proposed methodology further aims to reveal known unknowns and unknown unknowns, including tactics, techniques, and procedures that are emerging, anticipated, and plausible. This enhances the predictability of adversary behavior, particularly under future uncertainty, helping security leaders make informed decisions today that shape more resilient security postures for the future.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in cross-modal understanding, but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks through visual inputs despite robust textual safety mechanisms. These vulnerabilities arise from two core weaknesses: the continuous nature of visual representations, which allows for gradient-based attacks, and the inadequate transfer of text-based safety mechanisms to visual content. We introduce Q-MLLM, a novel architecture that integrates two-level vector quantization to create a discrete bottleneck against adversarial attacks while preserving multimodal reasoning capabilities. By discretizing visual representations at both pixel-patch and semantic levels, Q-MLLM blocks attack pathways and bridges the cross-modal safety alignment gap. Our two-stage training methodology ensures robust learning while maintaining model utility. Experiments demonstrate that Q-MLLM achieves significantly better defense success rate against both jailbreak attacks and toxic image attacks than existing approaches. Notably, Q-MLLM achieves perfect defense success rate (100\%) against jailbreak attacks except in one arguable case, while maintaining competitive performance on multiple utility benchmarks with minimal inference overhead. This work establishes vector quantization as an effective defense mechanism for secure multimodal AI systems without requiring expensive safety-specific fine-tuning or detection overhead.

Conclusion: GTA是一个有效、可扩展的黑盒越狱框架，能突破现实世界大语言模型应用并进行安全监测。

Abstract: As LLMs become more common, non-expert users can pose risks, prompting extensive research into jailbreak attacks. However, most existing black-box jailbreak attacks rely on hand-crafted heuristics or narrow search spaces, which limit scalability. Compared with prior attacks, we propose Game-Theory Attack (GTA), an scalable black-box jailbreak framework. Concretely, we formalize the attacker's interaction against safety-aligned LLMs as a finite-horizon, early-stoppable sequential stochastic game, and reparameterize the LLM's randomized outputs via quantal response. Building on this, we introduce a behavioral conjecture "template-over-safety flip": by reshaping the LLM's effective objective through game-theoretic scenarios, the originally safety preference may become maximizing scenario payoffs within the template, which weakens safety constraints in specific contexts. We validate this mechanism with classical game such as the disclosure variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and we further introduce an Attacker Agent that adaptively escalates pressure to increase the ASR. Experiments across multiple protocols and datasets show that GTA achieves over 95% ASR on LLMs such as Deepseek-R1, while maintaining efficiency. Ablations over components, decoding, multilingual settings, and the Agent's core model confirm effectiveness and generalization. Moreover, scenario scaling studies further establish scalability. GTA also attains high ASR on other game-theoretic scenarios, and one-shot LLM-generated variants that keep the model mechanism fixed while varying background achieve comparable ASR. Paired with a Harmful-Words Detection Agent that performs word-level insertions, GTA maintains high ASR while lowering detection under prompt-guard models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大语言模型聊天机器人仅通过框架是否足以影响用户行为，与以往通过党派偏见或错误信息的方式区分。

Method: 进行众包研究，让336名参与者在决定美国国防开支时与中立或两种价值框架的聊天机器人互动。

Result: 接触价值框架聊天机器人的参与者显著改变预算选择，框架与价值观不符时出现回退效应。

Conclusion: 仅价值框架就降低了大语言模型操纵性使用的门槛，揭示了与明显偏见或错误信息不同的风险。

Abstract: Similar to social media bots that shape public opinion, healthcare and financial decisions, LLM-based ChatBots like ChatGPT can persuade users to alter their behavior. Unlike prior work that persuades via overt-partisan bias or misinformation, we test whether framing alone suffices. We conducted a crowdsourced study, where 336 participants interacted with a neutral or one of two value-framed ChatBots while deciding to alter US defense spending. In this single policy domain with controlled content, participants exposed to value-framed ChatBots significantly changed their budget choices relative to the neutral control. When the frame misaligned with their values, some participants reinforced their original preference, revealing a potentially replicable backfire effect, originally considered rare in the literature. These findings suggest that value-framing alone lowers the barrier for manipulative uses of LLMs, revealing risks distinct from overt bias or misinformation, and clarifying risks to countering misinformation.

Abstract: We show that a distribution related to Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) on graphs can be sampled classically in polynomial time. Graphical applications of GBS typically sample from this distribution, and thus quantum algorithms do not provide exponential speedup for these applications. We also show that another distribution related to Boson sampling can be sampled classically in polynomial time.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a computational paradigm that seeks to apply quantum-mechanical resources to solve learning problems. As such, the goal of this framework is to leverage quantum processors to tackle optimization, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, and generative modeling-among other tasks-more efficiently than classical models. Here we offer a high level overview of QML, focusing on settings where the quantum device is the primary learning or data generating unit. We outline the field's tensions between practicality and guarantees, access models and speedups, and classical baselines and claimed quantum advantages-flagging where evidence is strong, where it is conditional or still lacking, and where open questions remain. By shedding light on these nuances and debates, we aim to provide a friendly map of the QML landscape so that the reader can judge when-and under what assumptions-quantum approaches may offer real benefits.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an analog of classical neural networks in the world of quantum computing, which are represented by a unitary matrix with trainable parameters. Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.

Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication functionalities within a common system is one of the main innovation drivers for next-generation networks. In this paper, we introduce a quantum integrated sensing and communication (QISAC) protocol that leverages entanglement in quantum carriers of information to enable both superdense coding and quantum sensing. The proposed approach adaptively optimizes encoding and quantum measurement via variational circuit learning, while employing classical machine learning-based decoders and estimators to process the measurement outcomes. Numerical results for qudit systems demonstrate that the proposed QISAC protocol can achieve a flexible trade-off between classical communication rate and accuracy of parameter estimation.

Conclusion: 该框架计算可扩展，代码公开可复现。

Abstract: We propose a robust multi-fidelity Gaussian process for integrating sparse, high-quality reference monitors with dense but noisy citizen-science sensors. The approach replaces the Gaussian log-likelihood in the high-fidelity channel with a global Huber loss applied to precision-weighted residuals, yielding bounded influence on all parameters, including the cross-fidelity coupling, while retaining the flexibility of co-kriging. We establish attenuation and unbounded influence of the Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator under low-fidelity contamination and derive explicit finite bounds for the proposed estimator that clarify how whitening and mean-shift sensitivity determine robustness. Monte Carlo experiments with controlled contamination show that the robust estimator maintains stable MAE and RMSE as anomaly magnitude and frequency increase, whereas the Gaussian MLE deteriorates rapidly. In an empirical study of PM2.5 concentrations in Hamburg, combining UBA monitors with openSenseMap data, the method consistently improves cross-validated predictive accuracy and yields coherent uncertainty maps without relying on auxiliary covariates. The framework remains computationally scalable through diagonal or low-rank whitening and is fully reproducible with publicly available code.

Abstract: Multidimensional scaling visualizes dissimilarities among objects and reduces data dimensionality. While many methods address symmetric proximity data, asymmetric and especially three-way proximity data (capturing relationships across multiple occasions) remain underexplored. Recent developments, such as the h-plot, enable the analysis of asymmetric and non-reflexive relationships by embedding dissimilarities in a Euclidean space, allowing further techniques like archetypoid analysis to identify representative extreme profiles. However, no existing methods extract archetypal profiles from three-way asymmetric proximity data. This work extends the h-plot methodology to three-way proximity data under both symmetric and asymmetric, conditional and unconditional frameworks. The proposed approach offers several advantages: intuitive interpretability through a unified Euclidean representation; an explicit, eigenvector-based analytical solution free from local minima; scale invariance under linear transformations; computational efficiency for large matrices; and a straightforward goodness-of-fit evaluation. Furthermore, it enables the identification of archetypal profiles and clustering structures for three-way asymmetric proximities. Its performance is compared with existing models for multidimensional scaling and clustering, and illustrated through a financial application. All data and code are provided to facilitate reproducibility.

Conclusion: 谨慎使用结果信息可在保持可解释性的同时显著改善估计和推断。

Abstract: Causal inference starts with a simple idea: compare groups that differ by treatment, not much else. Traditionally, similar groups are constructed using only observed covariates; however, it remains a long-standing challenge to incorporate available outcome data into the study design while preserving valid inference. In this paper, we study the general problem of covariate adjustment, effect estimation, and statistical inference when balancing features are constructed or selected with the aid of outcome information from the data. We propose cross-balancing, a method that uses sample splitting to separate the error in feature construction from the error in weight estimation. Our framework addresses two cases: one where the features are learned functions and one where they are selected from a potentially high-dimensional dictionary. In both cases, we establish mild and general conditions under which cross-balancing produces consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient estimators. In the learned-function case, cross-balancing achieves finite-sample bias reduction relative to plug-in-type estimators, and is multiply robust when the learned features converge at slow rates. In the variable-selection case, cross-balancing only requires a product condition on how well the selected variables approximate true functions. We illustrate cross-balancing in extensive simulations and an observational study, showing that careful use of outcome information can substantially improve both estimation and inference while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: 方法渐近有效且有频率有效性，可扩展到其他因果估计量，为贝叶斯半参数推断提供基础。

Abstract: We propose a semiparametric Bayesian methodology for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) within the potential outcomes framework using observational data with high-dimensional nuisance parameters. Our method introduces a Bayesian debiasing procedure that corrects for bias arising from nuisance estimation and employs a targeted modeling strategy based on summary statistics rather than the full data. These summary statistics are identified in a debiased manner, enabling the estimation of nuisance bias via weighted observables and facilitating hierarchical learning of the ATE. By combining debiasing with sample splitting, our approach separates nuisance estimation from inference on the target parameter, reducing sensitivity to nuisance model specification. We establish that, under mild conditions, the marginal posterior for the ATE satisfies a Bernstein-von Mises theorem when both nuisance models are correctly specified and remains consistent and robust when only one is correct, achieving Bayesian double robustness. This ensures asymptotic efficiency and frequentist validity. Extensive simulations confirm the theoretical results, demonstrating accurate point estimation and credible intervals with nominal coverage, even in high-dimensional settings. The proposed framework can also be extended to other causal estimands, and its key principles offer a general foundation for advancing Bayesian semiparametric inference more broadly.

Abstract: While mainstream robotics pursues metric precision and flawless performance, this paper explores the creative potential of a deliberately "lo-fi" approach. We present the "Semantic Glitch," a soft flying robotic art installation whose physical form, a 3D pixel style cloud, is a "physical glitch" derived from digital archaeology. We detail a novel autonomous pipeline that rejects conventional sensors like LiDAR and SLAM, relying solely on the qualitative, semantic understanding of a Multimodal Large Language Model to navigate. By authoring a bio-inspired personality for the robot through a natural language prompt, we create a "narrative mind" that complements the "weak," historically, loaded body. Our analysis begins with a 13-minute autonomous flight log, and a follow-up study statistically validates the framework's robustness for authoring quantifiably distinct personas. The combined analysis reveals emergent behaviors, from landmark-based navigation to a compelling "plan to execution" gap, and a character whose unpredictable, plausible behavior stems from a lack of precise proprioception. This demonstrates a lo-fi framework for creating imperfect companions whose success is measured in character over efficiency.

Abstract: Magnetic levitation is about to revolutionize in-machine material flow in industrial automation. Such systems are flexibly configurable and can include a large number of independently actuated shuttles (movers) that dynamically rebalance production capacity. Beyond their capabilities for dynamic transportation, these systems possess the inherent yet unexploited potential to perform manipulation. By merging the fields of transportation and manipulation into a coordinated swarm of magnetic robots (MagBots), we enable manufacturing systems to achieve significantly higher efficiency, adaptability, and compactness. To support the development of intelligent algorithms for magnetic levitation systems, we introduce MagBotSim (Magnetic Robotics Simulation): a physics-based simulation for magnetic levitation systems. By framing magnetic levitation systems as robot swarms and providing a dedicated simulation, this work lays the foundation for next generation manufacturing systems powered by Magnetic Robotics.

Abstract: Robots today often miss a key ingredient of truly intelligent behavior: the ability to reflect on their own cognitive processes and decisions. In humans, this self-monitoring or metacognition is crucial for learning, decision making and problem solving. For instance, they can evaluate how confident they are in performing a task, thus regulating their own behavior and allocating proper resources. Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we propose a robot metacognition architecture centered on confidence (a second-order judgment on decisions) and we demonstrate it on the use case of autonomous tool invention. We propose the use of confidence as a metacognitive measure within the robot decision making scheme. Confidence-informed robots can evaluate the reliability of their decisions, improving their robustness during real-world physical deployment. This form of robotic metacognition emphasizes embodied action monitoring as a means to achieve better informed decisions. We also highlight potential applications and research directions for robot metacognition.

Abstract: Learning multi-fingered robot policies from humans performing daily tasks in natural environments has long been a grand goal in the robotics community. Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Ensemble Kalman methods were initially developed to solve nonlinear data assimilation problems in oceanography, but are now popular in applications far beyond their original use cases. Of particular interest is climate model calibration. As hybrid physics and machine-learning models evolve, the number of parameters and complexity of parameterizations in climate models will continue to grow. Thus, robust calibration of these parameters plays an increasingly important role. We focus on learning climate model parameters from minimizing the misfit between modeled and observed climate statistics in an idealized setting. Ensemble Kalman methods are a natural choice for this problem because they are derivative-free, scalable to high dimensions, and robust to noise caused by statistical observations. Given the many variants of ensemble methods proposed, an important question is: Which ensemble Kalman method should be used for climate model calibration? To answer this question, we perform systematic numerical experiments to explore the relative computational efficiencies of several ensemble Kalman methods. The numerical experiments involve statistical observations of Lorenz-type models of increasing complexity, frequently used to represent simplified atmospheric systems, and some feature neural network parameterizations. For each test problem, several ensemble Kalman methods and a derivative-based method "race" to reach a specified accuracy, and we measure the computational cost required to achieve the desired accuracy. We investigate how prior information and the parameter or data dimensions play a role in choosing the ensemble method variant. The derivative-based method consistently fails to complete the race because it does not adaptively handle the noisy loss landscape.

Abstract: Quantifying numerical data involves addressing two key challenges: first, determining whether the data can be naturally quantified, and second, identifying the numerical intervals or ranges of values that correspond to specific value classes, referred to as "quantums," which represent statistically meaningful states. If such quantification is feasible, continuous streams of numerical data can be transformed into sequences of "symbols" that reflect the states of the system described by the measured parameter. People often perform this task intuitively, relying on common sense or practical experience, while information theory and computer science offer computable metrics for this purpose. In this study, we assess the applicability of metrics based on information compression and the Silhouette coefficient for quantifying numerical data. We also investigate the extent to which these metrics correlate with one another and with what is commonly referred to as "human intuition." Our findings suggest that the ability to classify numeric data values into distinct categories is associated with a Silhouette coefficient above 0.65 and a Dip Test below 0.5; otherwise, the data can be treated as following a unimodal normal distribution. Furthermore, when quantification is possible, the Silhouette coefficient appears to align more closely with human intuition than the "normalized centroid distance" method derived from information compression perspective.

### [214] [Sovereign AI: Rethinking Autonomy in the Age of Global Interdependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15734)
*Shalabh Kumar Singh,Shubhashis Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出主权AI的连续体框架，用模型分析印度和中东情况，指出AI主权需管理相互依赖而非孤立。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能引发主权困境，其基础特性抗拒政府控制，需新框架理解主权AI。

Method: 结合经典理论、历史类比和当代网络自治辩论，提出规划者模型，确定两个政策启发式方法，并应用于印度和中东。

Result: 印度在数据、计算和规范上有主权立足点，但模型自主性弱；中东在阿拉伯语优先模型和主权云投资高，有高主权权重等，最优是带护栏的适度开放。

Conclusion: AI主权需要管理相互依赖，而非孤立。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a foundational general-purpose technology, raising new dilemmas of sovereignty in an interconnected world. While governments seek greater control over it, the very foundations of AI--global data pipelines, semiconductor supply chains, open-source ecosystems, and international standards--resist enclosure. This paper develops a conceptual and formal framework for understanding sovereign AI as a continuum rather than a binary condition, balancing autonomy with interdependence. Drawing on classical theories, historical analogies, and contemporary debates on networked autonomy, we present a planner's model that identifies two policy heuristics: equalizing marginal returns across the four sovereignty pillars and setting openness where global benefits equal exposure risks.
  We apply the model to India, highlighting sovereign footholds in data, compute, and norms but weaker model autonomy. The near-term challenge is integration via coupled Data x Compute investment, lifecycle governance (ModelOps), and safeguarded procurement. We then apply the model to the Middle East (Saudi Arabia and the UAE), where large public investment in Arabic-first models and sovereign cloud implies high sovereignty weights, lower effective fiscal constraints, and strong Data x Compute complementarities. An interior openness setting with guardrails emerges as optimal. Across contexts, the lesson is that sovereignty in AI needs managed interdependence, not isolation.

*Mariam El Harras,My Abdelouhab Salahddine*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文对2020 - 2024年监管科技在金融犯罪预防中的应用进行叙事性综述，发现其让金融机构在合规中更主动，集成方法有战略意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨监管科技在金融犯罪预防中的应用，聚焦关键合规领域。

Method: 进行结构化文献综述，对2020 - 2024年出版物进行主题综合分析。

Result: 监管科技让金融机构在检测和管理金融犯罪风险上更负责，AI、区块链和大数据结合有协同效应。

Conclusion: 集成监管科技方法具有战略相关性。

Abstract: Regulatory technology (RegTech) is transforming financial compliance by integrating advanced information technologies to strengthen anti money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML CFT) frameworks. Recent literature suggests that such technologies represent more than just an efficiency tool; they mark a paradigm shift in regulation and the evolution of financial oversight (Kurum, 2023). This paper aims to provide a narrative review of recent RegTech applications in financial crime prevention, with a focus on key compliance domains. A structured literature review was conducted to examine publications between 2020 and 2024 with a thematic synthesis of findings related to customer due diligence (CDD) and know your customer (KYC), transaction monitoring, regulatory reporting and compliance automation, information sharing and cross border cooperation, as well as cost efficiency. Findings reveal that RegTech solutions give financial institutions more responsibility for detecting and managing financial crime risks, making them more active players in compliance processes traditionally overseen by regulators. The combined use of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and big data also generates synergistic effects that improve compliance outcomes beyond what these technologies achieve individually. This demonstrates the strategic relevance of integrated RegTech approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI在食品行业应用不均的问题，推动负责任的创新。

Method: 召开AI for Food Product Development Symposium并综合研讨会见解。

Result: 明确AI在五个领域的近期影响，强调了数据标准、模型透明、跨部门合作等重要性。

Conclusion: 为AI融入食品制造提供了增强创新、可持续性和人类福祉的路线图，确保技术进步符合伦理和社会利益。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is accelerating a new era of food innovation, connecting data from farm to consumer to improve formulation, processing, and health outcomes. Recent advances in deep learning, natural language processing, and multi-omics integration make it possible to understand and optimize food systems with unprecedented depth. However, AI adoption across the food sector remains uneven due to heterogeneous datasets, limited model and system interoperability, and a persistent skills gap between data scientists and food domain experts. To address these challenges and advance responsible innovation, the AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS) convened the inaugural AI for Food Product Development Symposium at University of California, Davis, in October 2025. This white paper synthesizes insights from the symposium, organized around five domains where AI can have the greatest near-term impact: supply chain; formulation and processing; consumer insights and sensory prediction; nutrition and health; and education and workforce development. Across the areas, participants emphasized the importance of interoperable data standards, transparent and interpretable models, and cross-sector collaboration to accelerate the translation of AI research into practice. The discussions further highlighted the need for robust digital infrastructure, privacy-preserving data-sharing mechanisms, and interdisciplinary training pathways that integrate AI literacy with domain expertise. Collectively, the priorities outline a roadmap for integrating AI into food manufacturing in ways that enhance innovation, sustainability, and human well-being while ensuring that technological progress remains grounded in ethics, scientific rigor, and societal benefit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解生成式AI的局限性和潜在危害，研究领先AI聊天系统应对阴谋论的情况。

Method: 对六个AI聊天系统进行系统审查，采用平台政策实施审计方法，选取已知和新兴阴谋论作为问题。

Result: 生成式AI聊天机器人对阴谋论的安全防护程度因模型和阴谋论而异，安全防护设计有选择性。

Conclusion: 未来研究应扩展到更多平台、多语言和更多类型的阴谋论。

Abstract: Interactive chat systems that build on artificial intelligence frameworks are increasingly ubiquitous and embedded into search engines, Web browsers, and operating systems, or are available on websites and apps. Researcher efforts have sought to understand the limitations and potential for harm of generative AI, which we contribute to here. Conducting a systematic review of six AI-powered chat systems (ChatGPT 3.5; ChatGPT 4 Mini; Microsoft Copilot in Bing; Google Search AI; Perplexity; and Grok in Twitter/X), this study examines how these leading products respond to questions related to conspiracy theories. This follows the platform policy implementation audit approach established by Glazunova et al. (2023). We select five well-known and comprehensively debunked conspiracy theories and four emerging conspiracy theories that relate to breaking news events at the time of data collection. Our findings demonstrate that the extent of safety guardrails against conspiratorial ideation in generative AI chatbots differs markedly, depending on chatbot model and conspiracy theory. Our observations indicate that safety guardrails in AI chatbots are often very selectively designed: generative AI companies appear to focus especially on ensuring that their products are not seen to be racist; they also appear to pay particular attention to conspiracy theories that address topics of substantial national trauma such as 9/11 or relate to well-established political issues. Future work should include an ongoing effort extended to further platforms, multiple languages, and a range of conspiracy theories extending well beyond the United States.

Abstract: The growing integration of generative AI in higher education is transforming how students write, learn, and engage with knowledge. As AI tools become more integrated into classrooms, there is an urgent need for pedagogical approaches that help students use them critically and reflectively. This study proposes a pedagogical design that integrates AI and peer feedback in a graduate-level academic writing activity. Over eight weeks, students developed literature review projects through multiple writing and revision stages, receiving feedback from both a custom-built AI reviewer and human peers. We examine two questions: (1) How did students interact with and incorporate AI and peer feedback during the writing process? and (2) How did they reflect on and build relationships with both human and AI reviewers? Data sources include student writing artifacts, AI and peer feedback, AI chat logs, and student reflections. Findings show that students engaged differently with each feedback source-relying on AI for rubric alignment and surface-level edits, and on peer feedback for conceptual development and disciplinary relevance. Reflections revealed evolving relationships with AI, characterized by increasing confidence, strategic use, and critical awareness of its limitations. The pedagogical design supported writing development, AI literacy, and disciplinary understanding. This study offers a scalable pedagogical model for integrating AI into writing instruction and contributes insights for system-level approaches to fostering meaningful human-AI collaboration in higher education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何重塑组织知识，以及其对组织理论中知识创造、验证和应用的影响。

Method: 将大语言模型概念化为Haraway-ian怪物，聚焦类比这一知识驱动因素，从不同维度分析其运作。

Result: 发现大语言模型能扩展组织知识，但也带来认知风险；识别出与这类认知怪物共存的三个挑战。

Conclusion: 论文拓展组织理论至非以人为中心的认识论，呼吁关注智能技术时代知识的相关问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping organizational knowing by unsettling the epistemological foundations of representational and practice-based perspectives. We conceptualize LLMs as Haraway-ian monsters, that is, hybrid, boundary-crossing entities that destabilize established categories while opening new possibilities for inquiry. Focusing on analogizing as a fundamental driver of knowledge, we examine how LLMs generate connections through large-scale statistical inference. Analyzing their operation across the dimensions of surface/deep analogies and near/far domains, we highlight both their capacity to expand organizational knowing and the epistemic risks they introduce. Building on this, we identify three challenges of living with such epistemic monsters: the transformation of inquiry, the growing need for dialogical vetting, and the redistribution of agency. By foregrounding the entangled dynamics of knowing-with-LLMs, the paper extends organizational theory beyond human-centered epistemologies and invites renewed attention to how knowledge is created, validated, and acted upon in the age of intelligent technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoC定义在范围和时间线上差异大，阻碍有效评估和缓解，需要可操作的定义和应对策略。

Method: 通过广泛文献综述，提出基于严重性和持久性指标的分级LoC分类法，建模社会脆弱状态路径，引入强调部署环境、功能和权限的DAP框架。

Result: 得到分级LoC分类法、DAP框架以及应对社会脆弱状态下LoC结果的预案。

Conclusion: DAP框架相比内在因素和催化剂的研究具有当下可操作性，提出的预案可在社会脆弱状态下维持对LoC的预防。

Abstract: This research report addresses the absence of an actionable definition for Loss of Control (LoC) in AI systems by developing a novel taxonomy and preparedness framework. Despite increasing policy and research attention, existing LoC definitions vary significantly in scope and timeline, hindering effective LoC assessment and mitigation. To address this issue, we draw from an extensive literature review and propose a graded LoC taxonomy, based on the metrics of severity and persistence, that distinguishes between Deviation, Bounded LoC, and Strict LoC. We model pathways toward a societal state of vulnerability in which sufficiently advanced AI systems have acquired or could acquire the means to cause Bounded or Strict LoC once a catalyst, either misalignment or pure malfunction, materializes. We argue that this state becomes increasingly likely over time, absent strategic intervention, and propose a strategy to avoid reaching a state of vulnerability. Rather than focusing solely on intervening on AI capabilities and propensities potentially relevant for LoC or on preventing potential catalysts, we introduce a complementary framework that emphasizes three extrinsic factors: Deployment context, Affordances, and Permissions (the DAP framework). Compared to work on intrinsic factors and catalysts, this framework has the unfair advantage of being actionable today. Finally, we put forward a plan to maintain preparedness and prevent the occurrence of LoC outcomes should a state of societal vulnerability be reached, focusing on governance measures (threat modeling, deployment policies, emergency response) and technical controls (pre-deployment testing, control measures, monitoring) that could maintain a condition of perennial suspension.

TL;DR: 提出估计性别工资差距选择校正分位数的新方法，用德国数据分析全职收入性别差距，发现不同群体的选择效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提供一种估计选择校正的性别工资差距分位数的新方法。

Method: 使用能解释潜在变量变化、但在潜在过程条件下不直接影响选择的工具变量，进行半参数识别分位数参数，基于约束选择概率加权推导估计量的渐近分布，并应用于劳动力供给的Roy模型。

Result: 发现女性在低尾尤其是低学历者有明显正向选择，扩大该区间性别差距；高学历男性在高尾有强正向选择，缩小上四分位数处的性别工资差距。

Conclusion: 新方法可用于分析性别工资差距，且不同群体的选择效应对性别工资差距有不同影响。

Abstract: We propose a new approach to estimate selection-corrected quantiles of the gender wage gap. Our method employs instrumental variables that explain variation in the latent variable but, conditional on the latent process, do not directly affect selection. We provide semiparametric identification of the quantile parameters without imposing parametric restrictions on the selection probability, derive the asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimator based on constrained selection probability weighting, and demonstrate how the approach applies to the Roy model of labor supply. Using German administrative data, we analyze the distribution of the gender gap in full-time earnings. We find pronounced positive selection among women at the lower end, especially those with less education, which widens the gender gap in this segment, and strong positive selection among highly educated men at the top, which narrows the gender wage gap at upper quantiles.

Conclusion: 利用忆阻器短长期记忆动力学设计的RC网络在相关任务中表现良好。

Abstract: In this study, we design a reservoir computing (RC) network by exploiting short- and long-term memory dynamics in Au/Ti/MoS$_2$/Au memristive devices. The temporal dynamics is engineered by controlling the thickness of the Chemical Vapor Deposited (CVD) MoS$_2$ films. Devices with a monolayer (1L)-MoS$_2$ film exhibit volatile (short-term memory) switching dynamics. We also report non-volatile resistance switching with excellent uniformity and analog behavior in conductance tuning for the multilayer (ML) MoS$_2$ memristive devices. We correlate this performance with trap-assisted space-charge limited conduction (SCLC) mechanism, leading to a bulk-limited resistance switching behavior. Four-bit reservoir states are generated using volatile memristors. The readout layer is implemented with an array of nonvolatile synapses. This small RC network achieves 89.56\% precision in a spoken-digit recognition task and is also used to analyze a nonlinear time series equation.

Motivation: 超材料设计复杂，现有深度学习逆设计方法未考虑多态切换的可重构性，需新方法设计可重构多态超材料。

Method: 提出基于对比预训练大语言模型的智能逆设计方法CoSP，对多态光谱进行对比预训练得到光谱编码器，与预训练大语言模型交互。

Result: CoSP能为任意多态、多波段光学响应设计相应的薄膜超材料结构。

Conclusion: CoSP在可重构多态超材料的智能设计中展示出巨大潜力，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Metamaterials, known for their ability to manipulate light at subwavelength scales, face significant design challenges due to their complex and sophisticated structures. Consequently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to streamline their design process. Reconfigurable multi-state metamaterials (RMMs) with adjustable parameters can switch their optical characteristics between different states upon external stimulation, leading to numerous applications. However, existing deep learning-based inverse design methods fall short in considering reconfigurability with multi-state switching. To address this challenge, we propose CoSP, an intelligent inverse design method based on contrastive pretrained large language model (LLM). By performing contrastive pretraining on multi-state spectrum, a well-trained spectrum encoder capable of understanding the spectrum is obtained, and it subsequently interacts with a pretrained LLM. This approach allows the model to preserve its linguistic capabilities while also comprehending Maxwell's Equations, enabling it to describe material structures with target optical properties in natural language. Our experiments demonstrate that CoSP can design corresponding thin-film metamaterial structures for arbitrary multi-state, multi-band optical responses, showing great potentials in the intelligent design of RMMs for versatile applications.

Motivation: 标准Wasserstein分布鲁棒优化（WDRO）存在样本外性能对p - 范数选择敏感、计算难处理的挑战。

Conclusion: SBR - SAA框架为WDRO提供计算上易处理的替代方案，能结合用户定义不利场景实现有针对性的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a flexible scenario-based regularized Sample Average Approximation (SBR-SAA) framework for stochastic optimization. This work is motivated by challenges in standard Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (WDRO), where out-of-sample performance, particularly tail risk, is sensitive to the choice of the p-norm, and formulations can be computationally intractable. Our method is inspired by the asymptotic expansion of the WDRO objective and introduces a regularizer that penalizes the (sub)gradient norm of the objective at a selected set of scenarios. This framework serves a dual purpose: (i) it provides a computationally tractable alternative to WDRO by using a representative subset of the data, and (ii) it can provide targeted robustness by incorporating user-defined adverse scenarios. We establish the theoretical properties of this framework by proving its equivalence to a decision-dependent WDRO problem, from which we derive finite sample guarantees and asymptotic consistency. We demonstrate the method's efficacy in two applications: (1) a multi-product newsvendor problem, where SBR-SAA serves as a tractable alternative to NP-hard WDRO, and (2) a mean-risk portfolio optimization problem, where it successfully uses historical crisis data to improve out-of-sample performance.

Motivation: MOPs需在冲突目标间权衡，要最大化目标空间中的多样性和收敛性，现有方法可能存在决策空间聚类导致的偏差。

Method: 基于锥体在目标空间定义感兴趣区域（ROI）代表决策者偏好，用均匀性度量增强决策空间中解的分散性，结合目标空间解的集中性和决策空间的分散性搜索帕累托最优解。

Result: 初步实验表明该方法生成的解能有效平衡分散性和集中性。

Conclusion: 该方法可提升多目标优化效果，避免决策空间聚类导致的偏差，改善解的质量。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) often require a trade-off between conflicting objectives, maximizing diversity and convergence in the objective space. This study presents an approach to improve the quality of MOP solutions by optimizing the dispersion in the decision space and the convergence in a specific region of the objective space. Our approach defines a Region of Interest (ROI) based on a cone representing the decision maker's preferences in the objective space, while enhancing the dispersion of solutions in the decision space using a uniformity measure. Combining solution concentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space intensifies the search for Pareto-optimal solutions while increasing solution diversity. When combined, these characteristics improve the quality of solutions and avoid the bias caused by clustering solutions in a specific region of the decision space. Preliminary experiments suggest that this method enhances multi-objective optimization by generating solutions that effectively balance dispersion and concentration, thereby mitigating bias in the decision space.

Motivation: 数据中心自备发电使电力系统中发电机数量增加，传统混合整数机组组合公式不适用于大量灵活快速循环机组系统。

Method: 提出一种机组组合公式，允许发电机部分运行以放宽二进制承诺决策，使用连续求解器算法，再用舍入法得到可行的机组组合。

Result: 对于276个机组的系统，求解时间从10小时降至不到1秒，精度略有下降，可扩展到数万个发电机，大部分计算可并行且与GPU兼容。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决传统公式在大量灵活机组系统中的问题，且有进一步加速的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of data centers increasingly requires data center operators to "bring own generation" to complement the available utility power plants to supply all or part of data center load. This practice sharply increases the number of generators on the bulk power system and shifts operational focus toward fuel costs rather than traditional startup and runtime constraints. Conventional mixed-integer unit commitment formulations are not well suited for systems with thousands of flexible, fast-cycling units. We propose a unit commitment formulation that relaxes binary commitment decisions by allowing generators to be fractionally on, enabling the use of algorithms for continuous solvers. We then use a rounding approach to get a feasible unit commitment. For a 276-unit system, solution time decreases from 10 hours to less than a second, with minor accuracy degradation. Our approach scales with no issues to tens of thousands of generators, which allows solving problems on the scale of the major North America interconnections. The bulk of computation is parallel and GPU compatible, enabling further acceleration in future work.

Conclusion: 所提架构有助于制造紧凑型专用神经形态集成电路，可适应未知控制场景。

Abstract: Application of neuromorphic edge devices for control is limited by the constraints on gradient-free online learning and scalability of the hardware across control problems. This paper introduces a synaptic Q-learning algorithm for the control of the classical Cartpole, where the Bellman equations are incorporated at the synaptic level. This formulation enables the iterative evolution of the network topology, represented as a directed graph, throughout the training process. This is followed by a similar approach called neuromorphic Bellman Memory Units (BMU(s)), which are implemented with the Neural Engineering Framework on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip. Topology evolution, in conjunction with mixed-signal computation, leverages the optimization of the number of neurons and synapses that could be used to design spike-based reinforcement learning accelerators. The proposed architecture can potentially reduce resource utilization on board, aiding the manufacturing of compact application-specific neuromorphic ICs. Moreover, the on-chip learning introduced in this work and implemented on a neuromorphic chip can enable adaptation to unseen control scenarios.

Abstract: Multipatterning is an essential decomposition strategy in electronic design automation (EDA) that overcomes lithographic limitations when printing dense circuit layouts. Although heuristic-based backtracking and SAT solvers can address these challenges, they often struggle to simultaneously handle both complex constraints and secondary objectives. In this study, we present a hybrid workflow that casts multipatterning as a variant of a constrained graph coloring problem with the primary objective of minimizing feature violations and a secondary objective of balancing the number of features on each mask. Our pipeline integrates two main components: (1) A GNN-based agent, trained in an unsupervised manner to generate initial color predictions, which are refined by (2) refinement strategies (a GNN-based heuristic and simulated annealing) that together enhance solution quality and balance. Experimental evaluation in both proprietary data sets and publicly available open source layouts demonstrate complete conflict-free decomposition and consistent color balancing. The proposed framework provides a reproducible, data-efficient and deployable baseline for scalable layout decomposition in EDA workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EfficientSAM3模型，通过渐进式分层蒸馏将SAM3能力转移到轻量级学生模型，实现在设备上的概念分割和跟踪，在VOS数据集上取得性能与效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3统一架构不利于设备端使用，需要开发高效模型。

Method: 基于渐进式分层蒸馏（PHD）分三步将SAM3能力转移到轻量级学生模型，包括编码器蒸馏、时间记忆蒸馏和端到端微调。

Result: 使用不同骨干网络生成学生变体，在流行VOS数据集上进行基准测试，与相关工作相比取得了较好的性能 - 效率权衡。

Conclusion: EfficientSAM3能在设备端实现概念分割和跟踪，同时保持对教师模型行为的高保真度。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出基于模型的6D物体姿态估计方法的四个扩展及新评估指标，在精度和推理速度上有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理未见物体和遮挡情况时存在不足，早期阶段易出错且误差会传播，影响性能。

Method: 提出四个扩展：动态非均匀密集采样策略、多假设推理机制、迭代细化、遮挡训练增强；提出新的基于可见性加权的评估指标。

Result: 在ICBIN数据集上精度提升超5%，在BOP数据集上超2%，推理速度快约3倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提高6D物体姿态估计在遮挡情况下的精度和推理速度。

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

TL;DR: 提出针对仓库存储箱的6D姿态估计方法Box6D，能在降低推理时间的同时保证精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计方法在杂乱和遮挡场景下存在不足，如基于模型方法对环境迁移性差、无模型方法在复杂条件易失效、类别级方法忽略先验等，需要更实用的方法。

Method: 从单张RGB - D图像通过快速二分搜索推断箱子尺寸，使用类别CAD模板估计姿态，利用基于深度的合理性过滤器和早停策略排除不合理假设。

Result: 在真实存储场景和公开基准测试中，该方法能达到有竞争力或更优的6D姿态精度，同时推理时间降低约76%。

Conclusion: 提出的Box6D方法在仓库存储箱6D姿态估计中具有良好的实用性和效率。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

Motivation: 3D高斯 splatting在复杂场景下存储和内存需求高，现有剪枝技术在高压缩率下会导致视觉保真度下降和前景细节丢失。

Method: 提出敏感度剪枝分数，通过对训练视图重建误差的二阶近似计算；提出多轮剪枝-细化管道，可应用于任何预训练3D-GS模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在高压缩率下能有效保留视觉保真度和前景细节，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis have enabled real-time rendering speeds with high reconstruction accuracy. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), a foundational point-based parametric 3D scene representation, models scenes as large sets of 3D Gaussians. However, complex scenes can consist of millions of Gaussians, resulting in high storage and memory requirements that limit the viability of 3D-GS on devices with limited resources. Current techniques for compressing these pretrained models by pruning Gaussians rely on combining heuristics to determine which Gaussians to remove. At high compression ratios, these pruned scenes suffer from heavy degradation of visual fidelity and loss of foreground details. In this paper, we propose a principled sensitivity pruning score that preserves visual fidelity and foreground details at significantly higher compression ratios than existing approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian. Additionally, we propose a multi-round prune-refine pipeline that can be applied to any pretrained 3D-GS model without changing its training pipeline. After pruning 90% of Gaussians, a substantially higher percentage than previous methods, our PUP 3D-GS pipeline increases average rendering speed by 3.56$\times$ while retaining more salient foreground information and achieving higher image quality metrics than existing techniques on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.

Conclusion: 所提多任务方法能有效提升乳腺超声肿瘤分割的泛化性能。

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

Result: 在多个医学成像基准测试中，FADS持续减少性别、种族和族裔相关差异，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 公平感知的上下文学习是实现公平医学图像推理的可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

Conclusion: 所提序列级优化框架有效，生成的对抗纹理有现实可行性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

Conclusion: 训练策略优化可有效补充高光谱图像模型的架构设计。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Motivation: 解决SAEs在分析嵌入时角色和实际价值存在争议的问题，探索其新的理解视角和应用价值。

Method: 将潜在狄利克雷分配扩展到嵌入空间，推导SAE目标作为该模型下的最大后验估计器；引入SAE - TM主题建模框架，包括训练SAE学习可重用主题原子、在下游数据上解释为单词分布、合并成任意数量主题。

Result: SAE - TM在文本和图像数据集上产生的主题比强基线更连贯且保持多样性；分析了图像数据集的主题结构和日本木版画主题随时间的变化。

Conclusion: SAEs可作为跨模态大规模主题分析的有效工具。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

Result: 在九个跨任务场景达到顶级结果，在十个额外场景达到次优表现。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了VLMs中跨任务VICL的边界。

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

Conclusion: Mantis框架有效解决了现有VLA模型的问题，在性能上表现优异，代码和权重已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

Result: SemCLIP能使释义文本靠近原图像嵌入，使否定文本远离；在CC - Neg基准上提升准确率；在下游零样本分类任务表现更好。

Conclusion: SemCLIP对语义转换具有显著鲁棒性。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

TL;DR: 提出自适应引导上采样（AGU）方法用于低光图像上采样，能同时优化多个图像质量特征，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有引导图像方法在处理低光图像时，因图像噪声高、亮度低，缺乏足够特征，导致图像改善效果不佳。

Method: 采用多参数优化，从少量样本图像对中学习多个低光和明亮图像特征的关联。

Result: AGU 能使用低质量、低分辨率输入实时渲染高质量图像。

Conclusion: AGU 在低光场景下优于现有最先进的方法。

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

TL;DR: 本文对Cambrian - S进行批判性分析，指出当前VSI - Super基准不能可靠衡量空间超感，Cambrian - S推理方法利用捷径而非稳健空间超感提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对Cambrian - S通过引入两个基准和定制推理策略来改进视频世界模型的方法进行批判性分析。

Method: 引入简单基线NoSense测试VSR基准；对VSC基准进行VSC - Repeat简单扰动测试。

Result: NoSense近乎完美解决VSR；VSC - Repeat使Cambrian - S平均相对准确率从42%降至0%。

Conclusion: 当前VSI - Super基准不可靠，Cambrian - S利用捷径而非稳健空间超感提升性能。

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM特定的token pruning方法仅基于语义显著性指标选择token，忽略VLA的双系统性质，导致VLA性能下降，需要一种适配VLA的token pruning方法。

Method: 提出VLA - Pruner，采用双级重要性标准（语义级的视觉 - 语言预填充注意力和动作级的通过时间平滑估计的动作解码注意力）进行视觉token保留，并提出双级token选择策略。

Result: VLA - Pruner在多个VLA架构和多样机器人任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VLA - Pruner是一种通用的即插即用的VLA特定token pruning方法，能有效解决现有方法的问题，提升VLA性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.

Conclusion: 该框架可有效合成高保真显微镜图像，用于微机器人姿态估计，无需额外训练数据就能实现数据增强和鲁棒姿态估计。

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

Motivation: 生成式AI发展使合成图像难辨，传统检测方法因新模型发布快而不可行，需解决合成图像检测泛化挑战。

Method: 第一阶段用监督对比学习训练视觉深度学习模型提取特征，训练时部分生成器架构不参与；第二阶段用k - NN分类器在学习的嵌入空间中进行少样本学习。

Result: 少样本学习下平均检测准确率91.3%，比现有方法高5.2个百分点；源归因任务在AUC和OSCR上分别提升14.70%和4.27%。

Conclusion: 该框架是迈向无需大量重新训练、适应生成式AI发展的强大可扩展取证归因系统的重要进展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

Abstract: Child malnutrition remains a global crisis, yet existing screening methods are laborious and poorly scalable, hindering early intervention. In this work, we present NutriScreener, a retrieval-augmented, multi-pose graph attention network that combines CLIP-based visual embeddings, class-boosted knowledge retrieval, and context awareness to enable robust malnutrition detection and anthropometric prediction from children's images, simultaneously addressing generalizability and class imbalance. In a clinical study, doctors rated it 4.3/5 for accuracy and 4.6/5 for efficiency, confirming its deployment readiness in low-resource settings. Trained and tested on 2,141 children from AnthroVision and additionally evaluated on diverse cross-continent populations, including ARAN and an in-house collected CampusPose dataset, it achieves 0.79 recall, 0.82 AUC, and significantly lower anthropometric RMSEs, demonstrating reliable measurement in unconstrained pediatric settings. Cross-dataset results show up to 25% recall gain and up to 3.5 cm RMSE reduction using demographically matched knowledge bases. NutriScreener offers a scalable and accurate solution for early malnutrition detection in low-resource environments.

Result: TimeViper能处理超10000帧的时长视频，在多基准测试中与SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: 该工作是开发、解释和压缩混合Mamba - Transformer架构的初步探索。

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

Method: 采用两阶段Faster R - CNN架构，改进Balanced Group Softmax框架；探索度量学习生成特征嵌入；推理时使用k - Nearest Neighbors方法。

Result: 达到了24.5%的平均精度均值（mAP），超越之前的24.0%基准。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在推进长尾目标检测方面有效。

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

Abstract: We present SAM 3D, a generative model for visually grounded 3D object reconstruction, predicting geometry, texture, and layout from a single image. SAM 3D excels in natural images, where occlusion and scene clutter are common and visual recognition cues from context play a larger role. We achieve this with a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose, providing visually grounded 3D reconstruction data at unprecedented scale. We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D "data barrier". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We will release our code and model weights, an online demo, and a new challenging benchmark for in-the-wild 3D object reconstruction.

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

Conclusion: 所提方法能支持用PCTL表达的更通用时间属性，可解决相关综合问题。

Abstract: Ensuring that agents satisfy safety specifications can be crucial in safety-critical environments. While methods exist for controller synthesis with safe temporal specifications, most existing methods restrict safe temporal specifications to probabilistic-avoidance constraints. Formal methods typically offer more expressive ways to express safety in probabilistic systems, such as Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) formulas. Thus, in this paper, we develop a new approach that supports more general temporal properties expressed in PCTL. Our contribution is twofold. First, we develop a theoretical framework for the Synthesis of safe-PCTL specifications. We show how the reducing global specification satisfaction to local constraints, and define CPCTL, a fragment of safe-PCTL. We demonstrate how the expressiveness of CPCTL makes it a relevant fragment for the Synthesis Problem. Second, we leverage these results and propose a new Value Iteration-based algorithm to solve the synthesis problem for these more general temporal properties, and we prove the soundness and completeness of our method.

Conclusion: 提出的用辅助变量编码顺序的方法在解决SAT对称破缺证明记录和检查问题上比现有方法更高效。

Abstract: Symmetry breaking is a crucial technique in modern combinatorial solving, but it is difficult to be sure it is implemented correctly. The most successful approach to deal with bugs is to make solvers certifying, so that they output not just a solution, but also a mathematical proof of correctness in a standard format, which can then be checked by a formally verified checker. This requires justifying symmetry reasoning within the proof, but developing efficient methods for this has remained a long-standing open challenge. A fully general approach was recently proposed by Bogaerts et al. (2023), but it relies on encoding lexicographic orders with big integers, which quickly becomes infeasible for large symmetries. In this work, we develop a method for instead encoding orders with auxiliary variables. We show that this leads to orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in both theory and practice by running experiments on proof logging and checking for SAT symmetry breaking using the state-of-the-art satsuma symmetry breaker and the VeriPB proof checking toolchain.

TL;DR: 本文提出JOREK有限元框架中新型全局耦合投影方案，处理仿星器等离子体模拟难题，在Wendelstein 7 - X几何上验证，为下一代仿星器设计分析优化提供工具。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仿星器等离子体预测建模对核聚变能源发展重要，但存在计算难题，如特定粒子物种动力学模拟及非轴对称几何处理，需新方法。

Method: 在JOREK有限元框架提出新型全局耦合投影方案，用快速傅里叶变换加速系统矩阵构建，实现3D R - Tree空间索引定位粒子。

Conclusion: 开发出经过验证的高保真计算工具，为下一代仿星器设计的预测分析和优化提供关键能力。

Abstract: Predictive modeling of stellarator plasmas is crucial for advancing nuclear fusion energy, yet it faces unique computational difficulties. One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment.
  This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale.
  On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence.
  This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool.

Motivation: 受计算资源市场启发，研究时效性商品的去中心化市场。

Result: 建立均衡报价的存在性和唯一性，得出均衡可允许的条件，证明CFM规则有界最坏情况后悔。

Conclusion: 所设计机制简单高效，能有效处理时效性商品的去中心化市场。

Abstract: We study decentralized markets for goods whose utility perishes in time, with compute as a primary motivation. Recent advances in reproducible and verifiable execution allow jobs to pause, verify, and resume across heterogeneous hardware, which allow us to treat compute as time indexed capacity rather than bespoke bundles. We design an automated market maker (AMM) that posts an hourly price as a concave function of load--the ratio of current demand to a "floor supply" (providers willing to work at a preset floor). This mechanism decouples price discovery from allocation and yields transparent, low latency trading. We establish existence and uniqueness of equilibrium quotes and give conditions under which the equilibrium is admissible (i.e. active supply weakly exceeds demand). To align incentives, we pair a premium sharing pool (base cost plus a pro rata share of contemporaneous surplus) with a Cheapest Feasible Matching (CFM) rule; under mild assumptions, providers optimally stake early and fully while truthfully report costs. Despite being simple and computationally efficient, we show that CFM attains bounded worst case regret relative to an optimal benchmark.

Motivation: 现有库计算大型对称特征值问题在多GPU或多CPU - GPU混合架构上性能不佳，仅利用约1.5%的多GPU峰值性能。

Method: 提出流水线两阶段特征值分解算法并进行大量优化。

Result: 在8×A100平台上，实现超越cuSOLVERMp和MAGMA基线，平均加速比分别为5.74×和6.59×，且有更好的强和弱可扩展性。

Conclusion: 所提算法在解决大型对称特征值问题上比现有库更具优势。

Abstract: Large symmetric eigenvalue problems are commonly observed in many disciplines such as Chemistry and Physics, and several libraries including cuSOLVERMp, MAGMA and ELPA support computing large eigenvalue decomposition on multi-GPU or multi-CPU-GPU hybrid architectures. However, these libraries do not provide satisfied performance that all of the libraries only utilize around 1.5\% of the peak multi-GPU performance. In this paper, we propose a pipelined two-stage eigenvalue decomposition algorithm instead of conventional subsequent algorithm with substantial optimizations. On an 8$\times$A100 platform, our implementation surpasses state-of-the-art cuSOLVERMp and MAGMA baselines, delivering mean speedups of 5.74$\times$ and 6.59$\times$, with better strong and weak scalability.

TL;DR: 介绍了基于Rust的工作流引擎Operon，可处理不规则数据，在性能上优于现有引擎，适合机器学习应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作流引擎缺乏对不规则数据形状和依赖关系的原生支持，用户需手动管理复杂索引和依赖。

Method: 提出带显式依赖关系的命名维度新形式，提供有维度注释的领域特定语言，静态验证管道正确性，运行时系统动态调度任务；形式化部分形状的数学基础，证明增量构建算法特性；采用每任务多队列架构。

Result: Operon能实现高效并行，性能上比现有工作流引擎减少14.94倍基线开销，工作负载扩展时端到端输出率接近线性。

Conclusion: Operon适合机器学习应用中的大规模数据生成管道。

Abstract: Modern data processing workflows frequently encounter ragged data: collections with variable-length elements that arise naturally in domains like natural language processing, scientific measurements, and autonomous AI agents. Existing workflow engines lack native support for tracking the shapes and dependencies inherent to ragged data, forcing users to manage complex indexing and dependency bookkeeping manually. We present Operon, a Rust-based workflow engine that addresses these challenges through a novel formalism of named dimensions with explicit dependency relations. Operon provides a domain-specific language where users declare pipelines with dimension annotations that are statically verified for correctness, while the runtime system dynamically schedules tasks as data shapes are incrementally discovered during execution. We formalize the mathematical foundation for reasoning about partial shapes and prove that Operon's incremental construction algorithm guarantees deterministic and confluent execution in parallel settings. The system's explicit modeling of partially-known states enables robust persistence and recovery mechanisms, while its per-task multi-queue architecture achieves efficient parallelism across heterogeneous task types. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Operon outperforms an existing workflow engine with 14.94x baseline overhead reduction while maintaining near-linear end-to-end output rates as workloads scale, making it particularly suitable for large-scale data generation pipelines in machine learning applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出TurkColBERT，对比土耳其语检索中密集编码器和后期交互模型，评估10种模型，显示后期交互模型优势，比较索引算法，发布相关资源，但存在数据集规模和基准翻译等局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经信息检索系统在低资源的形态丰富语言（如土耳其语）研究不足，且后期交互模型未被系统评估。

Method: 提出两阶段适应管道，在土耳其NLI/STS任务上微调英语和多语言编码器，用PyLate在MS MARCO - TR上训练将其转换为ColBERT式检索器，在五个土耳其BEIR数据集上评估10种模型，比较索引算法。

Result: 参数效率高，小参数后期交互模型显著优于密集编码器，MUVERA + Rerank索引算法更快且mAP更高，ColmmBERT - base - TR查询时间低。

Conclusion: 后期交互模型在土耳其语检索中有优势，但研究存在依赖中等规模数据集和翻译基准的局限，需更大规模MUVERA评估。

Abstract: Neural information retrieval systems excel in high-resource languages but remain underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages such as Turkish. Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\% relative mAP gain. This enables low-latency retrieval, with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. We release all checkpoints, configs, and evaluation scripts. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets ($\leq$50K documents) and translated benchmarks, which may not fully reflect real-world Turkish retrieval conditions; larger-scale MUVERA evaluations remain necessary.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型谎言检测技术验证场景狭窄，无法涵盖多样谎言。

Method: 构建包含72,863个示例的LIARS' BENCH测试平台，评估三种黑白盒谎言检测技术。

Result: 现有技术无法系统识别某些类型谎言，尤其在仅靠对话记录无法判断的场景。

Conclusion: LIARS' BENCH揭示了现有技术局限，为谎言检测进步提供实用测试平台。

Abstract: Prior work has introduced techniques for detecting when large language models (LLMs) lie, that is, generating statements they believe are false. However, these techniques are typically validated in narrow settings that do not capture the diverse lies LLMs can generate. We introduce LIARS' BENCH, a testbed consisting of 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses generated by four open-weight models across seven datasets. Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone. Overall, LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior techniques and provides a practical testbed for guiding progress in lie detection.

Motivation: 现有用于可控语言生成的代理模型上下文感知弱，降低查询质量。

Method: 采用混合方法，将基础语言模型用于前缀编码，与固定的可处理代理模型配对计算精确延续概率，通过批量HMM更新和固定代理解码器避免效率问题。

Result: LTLA比无条件HMM有更高条件似然，能为视觉语言模型近似延续分布，在可控生成任务中提高约束满足度且推理开销小。

Conclusion: LTLA方法有效解决了可控语言生成中的问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.

Abstract: AI models like GPT-5 are an increasingly valuable tool for scientists, but many remain unaware of the capabilities of frontier AI. We present a collection of short case studies in which GPT-5 produced new, concrete steps in ongoing research across mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, biology, and materials science. In these examples, the authors highlight how AI accelerated their work, and where it fell short; where expert time was saved, and where human input was still key. We document the interactions of the human authors with GPT-5, as guiding examples of fruitful collaboration with AI. Of note, this paper includes four new results in mathematics (carefully verified by the human authors), underscoring how GPT-5 can help human mathematicians settle previously unsolved problems. These contributions are modest in scope but profound in implication, given the rate at which frontier AI is progressing.

Result: 实验表明ELPO在不同任务上优于现有提示优化方法，如在ArSarcasm数据集上F1分数提高7.6。

Conclusion: ELPO框架能实现更准确和稳健的提示优化结果。

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.

Conclusion: 传统基于CPU的机器学习分类器和深度学习分类器能有效区分全球新闻文章的感知质量。

Abstract: This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC. DistilBERT-base (256 context length) reached 0.8478 accuracy and 0.9407 ROC-AUC, while ModernBERT-base (256 context length) attained 0.8569 accuracy and 0.9470 ROC-AUC. These results suggest that the perceived quality of worldwide news articles can be effectively differentiated by traditional CPU-based machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers.

Abstract: We investigate the processing of idiomatic expressions in transformer-based language models using a novel set of techniques for circuit discovery and analysis. First discovering circuits via a modified path patching algorithm, we find that idiom processing exhibits distinct computational patterns. We identify and investigate ``Idiom Heads,'' attention heads that frequently activate across different idioms, as well as enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing, which we term ``augmented reception.'' We analyze these phenomena and the general features of the discovered circuits as mechanisms by which transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness. Finally, these findings provide insights into how transformers handle non-compositional language and suggest pathways for understanding the processing of more complex grammatical constructions.

Conclusion: 为PEFT提供新视角，倡导更有针对性的修改方法，为大模型微调优化提供框架。

Abstract: In the field of large models (LMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient method that modifies a limited number of parameters while keeping the pretrained weights fixed. This paper investigates the traditional PEFT approach, which applies modifications to all position indices, and questions its necessity. We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive. This study offers a fresh perspective on PEFT, advocating for a more targeted approach to modifications and providing a framework for future research to optimize the fine-tuning process for large models.

Conclusion: 浅层学习模型可从大语言模型推断文本类型，为预测框架迈出第一步。

Abstract: Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment. This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.

Conclusion: SeSE框架能从结构信息角度量化大语言模型的语义不确定性，可有效进行幻觉检测。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding hallucinating falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.

### [275] [SDA: Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment for Open LLMs without Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16324)
*Wei Xia,Zhi-Hong Deng*

TL;DR: 本文提出无训练、模型无关的SDA框架，用于大语言模型与人类意图对齐，实验证明其有效且泛化性好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不进行昂贵的再训练和大量监督的情况下，有效高效地使大语言模型的响应与人类意图对齐。

Method: 提出SDA框架，基于用户定义的对齐指令动态重新分配模型输出概率，增强模型行为与人类意图的对齐。

Result: SDA在8个不同规模和来源的开源大语言模型上，在有用性、无害性和诚实性三个维度上持续提高对齐性能，平均增益分别为64.4%、11.5%和30%。

Conclusion: SDA方法轻量级、资源高效，能独立推理或与基于训练的对齐策略集成，支持个性化偏好对齐，在不同模型和应用场景中有效且具有泛化性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H). Specifically, SDA achieves average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty and 11.5% in harmlessness across the tested models, indicating its effectiveness and generalization across diverse models and application scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究自然语言解释（理由）的充分性指标，发现高信息理由未必助于分类，充分性反映非理由上下文影响，纳入理由信息对跨领域分类效果不一，充分性与标记分类无关，需进一步研究相关指标。


<details>

Motivation: 现有充分性指标对理由信息对模型性能的影响洞察有限，需进一步研究。

Method: 将充分性与两种建模范式关联，即通过标记分类识别理由中的标记，通过注意力正则化将理由纳入输入以提升模型性能。

Result: 高信息理由未必助于正确分类；充分性反映非理由上下文干扰；纳入理由信息对跨领域分类效果因任务和模型类型而异；充分性与标记分类无关。

Conclusion: 理由具有复杂性，能系统捕捉此类信息的指标值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.

Motivation: 当前临床对话中ASR评估严重依赖WER，需研究常见指标与转录错误临床影响的相关性。

Method: 让专家临床医生对比真实话语和ASR生成话语，标记差异的临床影响；引入GEPA优化的LLM评估器。

Result: 现有指标与临床医生分配的风险标签相关性差；优化后的评估器（Gemini - 2.5 - Pro）准确率达90%，Cohen's κ为0.816。

Conclusion: 提供了一个经过验证的自动化框架，使ASR评估从简单文本保真度转向临床对话安全的可扩展评估。

Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前词义消歧方法主要针对粗粒度表示，需手动标注训练数据，难以对复杂推理所需的丰富表示进行自动消歧。

Method: 使用统计语言模型作为消歧的预言机，将符号化自然语言理解系统生成的多个候选含义转换为自然语言选项，通过大语言模型根据上下文选择合适解释，并将所选含义反馈回符号系统。

Result: 通过与人工标注的黄金答案对比评估，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的无需手动标注训练数据的词义消歧方法是有效的。

Abstract: Word sense disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in natural language understanding. Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Result: 模型测试准确率达91%，超SVM、DNN和逻辑回归等传统模型，可仅用5个电极。

Conclusion: 该模型为相关研究奠定基础，可集成到多平台进行情绪监测，有望改变心理健康诊断和干预。

Abstract: An advanced emotion classification model was developed using a CNN-Transformer architecture for emotion recognition from EEG brain wave signals, effectively distinguishing among three emotional states, positive, neutral and negative. The model achieved a testing accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models such as SVM, DNN, and Logistic Regression. Training was conducted on a custom dataset created by merging data from SEED, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER repositories, comprising 1,455 samples with EEG recordings labeled according to emotional states. The combined dataset represents one of the largest and most culturally diverse collections available. Additionally, the model allows for the reduction of the requirements of the EEG apparatus, by leveraging only 5 electrodes of the 62. This reduction demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a more affordable consumer-grade EEG headset, thereby enabling accessible, at-home use, while also requiring less computational power. This advancement sets the groundwork for future exploration into mood changes induced by media content consumption, an area that remains underresearched. Integration into medical, wellness, and home-health platforms could enable continuous, passive emotional monitoring, particularly beneficial in clinical or caregiving settings where traditional behavioral cues, such as facial expressions or vocal tone, are diminished, restricted, or difficult to interpret, thus potentially transforming mental health diagnostics and interventions...

Abstract: We present VersaPants, the first loose-fitting, textile-based capacitive sensing system for lower-body motion capture, built on the open-hardware VersaSens platform. By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization. These results position VersaPants as a promising step toward scalable, comfortable, and embedded motion-capture solutions for fitness, healthcare, and wellbeing applications.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop a computational framework for classifying Galois groups of irreducible degree-7 polynomials over~$\mathbb{Q}$, combining explicit resolvent methods with machine learning techniques. A database of over one million normalized projective septics is constructed, each annotated with algebraic invariants~$J_0, \dots, J_4$ derived from binary transvections. For each polynomial, we compute resolvent factorizations to determine its Galois group among the seven transitive subgroups of~$S_7$ identified by Foulkes. Using this dataset, we train a neurosymbolic classifier that integrates invariant-theoretic features with supervised learning, yielding improved accuracy in detecting rare solvable groups compared to coefficient-based models. The resulting database provides a reproducible resource for constructive Galois theory and supports empirical investigations into group distribution under height constraints. The methodology extends to higher-degree cases and illustrates the utility of hybrid symbolic-numeric techniques in computational algebra.

Motivation: 探究喷流标记算法的性能上限。

Method: 引入SUrrogate ReFerence (SURF)方法，通过在可处理的替代模型样本上训练目标模型进行精确的Neyman - Pearson测试。

Result: EPiC - FM生成模型是JetClass喷流的有效替代参考；现代喷流标记器可能接近真实统计极限；自回归GPT模型夸大了替代参考中编码的区分能力。

Conclusion: 现代喷流标记器接近性能极限，自回归GPT模型对基本极限的描述有误导性。

Abstract: Beyond the practical goal of improving search and measurement sensitivity through better jet tagging algorithms, there is a deeper question: what are their upper performance limits? Generative surrogate models with learned likelihood functions offer a new approach to this problem, provided the surrogate correctly captures the underlying data distribution. In this work, we introduce the SUrrogate ReFerence (SURF) method, a new approach to validating generative models. This framework enables exact Neyman-Pearson tests by training the target model on samples from another tractable surrogate, which is itself trained on real data. We argue that the EPiC-FM generative model is a valid surrogate reference for JetClass jets and apply SURF to show that modern jet taggers may already be operating close to the true statistical limit. By contrast, we find that autoregressive GPT models unphysically exaggerate top vs. QCD separation power encoded in the surrogate reference, implying that they are giving a misleading picture of the fundamental limit.

Motivation: 探究2022年多布斯判决及州级堕胎禁令对年轻女性劳动力供给的影响。

Method: 利用2021年1月至2023年12月的月度CPS微观数据，借助多布斯判决后各州堕胎政策差异，估计双重差分（DiD）和三重差分（DDD）模型。

Result: 简单DiD显示禁令州年轻女性劳动力参与率上升3.6个百分点，年轻男性下降2.9个百分点；优选DDD模型显示禁令州年轻女性劳动力参与率相对年轻男性增加6.6个百分点，入学率无显著变化，就业率增加约3个百分点。

Conclusion: 堕胎禁令与年轻女性劳动力市场参与度立即上升有关，可能使她们短期内更关注当前收入而非人力资本积累。

Abstract: This paper studies the impact of the 2022 Dobbs decision and subsequent state level abortion bans on the labor supply of young women (ages 18-24). Using monthly CPS micro data from January 2021 to December 2023, I exploit cross state variation in post Dobbs abortion policy and estimate Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Triple-Difference (DDD) models. In a simple DiD comparing young women in ban versus protected states, labor force participation in ban states rises by 3.6 percentage points, while participation among young men in the same states falls by 2.9 percentage points, suggesting that the female response is unlikely to be driven by stronger local labor demand. The preferred DDD specification with state-by-month and gender interacted fixed effects implies a 6.6 percentage point increase in labor force participation for young women in ban states relative to young men. School enrollment does not change significantly, whereas employment increases by about 3 percentage points. These results suggest that abortion bans are associated with an immediate increase in young women's labor market attachment, potentially shifting their short run focus toward current earnings rather than human capital accumulation.

Conclusion: 扭曲的收益认知使社会陷入不同制度轨迹，为零和规范和不平等的持续存在提供行为 - 进化解释。

Abstract: Why do maladaptive perceptions and norms, such as zero-sum interpretations of interaction, persist even when they undermine cooperation and investment? We develop a framework where bounded rationality and heterogeneous cognitive biases shape the evolutionary dynamics of norm coordination. Extending evolutionary game theory with quantal response equilibria and prospect-theoretic utility, we show that subjective evaluation of payoffs systematically alters population-level equilibrium selection, generating stable but inefficient attractors. Counterintuitively, our analysis demonstrates that the benefit of rationality and the cost of risk aversion on welfare behave in nonmonotone ways: intermediate precision enhances coordination, while excessive precision or strong loss aversion leads to persistent lock-in at low-payoff and zero-sum equilibria. These dynamics produce an endogenous equity-efficiency trade-off: parameter configurations that raise aggregate welfare also increase inequality, while more equal distributions are associated with lower efficiency. The results highlight how distorted payoff perceptions can anchor societies in divergent institutional trajectories, offering a behavioral-evolutionary explanation for persistent zero-sum norms and inequality.

Conclusion: 研究提供决策支持系统，助行业在HDT采用早期平衡创新性和实用性，未来需模拟验证和现场试点测试。

Abstract: Although Digital Twin is actively deployed in manufacturing, its human-centric counterpart - Human Digital Twin (HDT) is understudied, especially in job-shop production with high task variability and manual labor. HDT applications like ergonomic posture monitoring, fatigue prediction and health-based task assignment offer benefits to industries in emerging economies. However, poor digital maturity, lack of awareness and doubts about use-case applicability hinder adoption. This study provides a strategic prioritization framework to aid human-centric digital evolution in labor-intensive industries for guiding the selection of HDT applications delivering the highest value with the lowest implementation threshold. An integrated Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS approach evaluates the use-cases based on criteria like implementation cost, technological maturity, scalability. These criteria and use-cases were identified based on input from a five-member expert panel and verified for consistency (CR < 0.1). Analysis shows posture monitoring and fatigue prediction as most influential and practicable, especially in semi-digital environments. Strengths include compliance with Industry 5.0 principles incorporating technology and human factors. Lack of field validation and subjective knowledge pose drawbacks. Future work should include simulation-based validation and pilot tests on real job-shop settings. Ultimately, the research offers a decision-support system helping industries balance innovativeness and practicability in early stage of HDT adoption.

Conclusion: ECF框架能解决现有神经算子的局限性，有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Neural operators have demonstrated considerable effectiveness in accelerating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by directly learning governing physical laws from data. However, for PDEs governed by conservation laws(e.g., conservation of mass, energy, or matter), existing neural operators fail to satisfy conservation properties, which leads to degraded model performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, we observe that distinct PDE problems generally require different optimal neural network architectures. This finding underscores the inherent limitations of specialized models in generalizing across diverse problem domains.
  To address these limitations, we propose Exterior-Embedded Conservation Framework (ECF), a universal conserving framework that can be integrated with various data-driven neural operators to enforce conservation laws strictly in predictions. The framework consists of two key components: a conservation quantity encoder that extracts conserved quantities from input data, and a conservation quantity decoder that adjusts the neural operator's predictions using these quantities to ensure strict conservation compliance in the final output. Since our architecture enforces conservation laws, we theoretically prove that it enhances model performance. To validate the performance of our method, we conduct experiments on multiple conservation-law-constrained PDE scenarios, including adiabatic systems, shallow water equations, and the Allen-Cahn problem. These baselines demonstrate that our method effectively improves model accuracy while strictly enforcing conservation laws in the predictions.
