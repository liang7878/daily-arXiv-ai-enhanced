Ideally, a theorist abstracts protocols as ideal,\nimplementation-independent primitives, letting conclusions in the \"ideal world\"\ncarry over to the \"real world.\" This is crucial, since the game theorist\ncannot--and should not be expected to--handle full cryptographic complexity. In\ntoday's landscape, the rise of distributed ledgers makes a shared language\nbetween cryptography and game theory increasingly necessary.\n  The security of cryptographic protocols hinges on two types of assumptions:\nstate-of-the-world (e.g., \"factoring is hard\") and behavioral (e.g., \"honest\nmajority\"). We observe that for protocols relying on behavioral assumptions\n(e.g., ledgers), our goal is unattainable in full generality. For\nstate-of-the-world assumptions, we show that standard solution concepts, e.g.,\n($\\epsilon$-)Nash equilibria, are not robust to transfer from the ideal to the\nreal world.\n  We propose a new solution concept: the pseudo-Nash equilibrium.

However, the\ndata ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and\nincompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail\nto cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this\npaper introduces the concept of \"Query as Test\" (QaT). This concept shifts the\nfocus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries\nagainst a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a\nfundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our\nproposal of \"Extensible Scenarios Notations\" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative\ndata framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly\nrepresents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as\na collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep\nsemantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports\ncomplex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides\nnatural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for\non-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy\nprotection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the\nfunctional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving\nsystems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing\nthe expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing.

To improve the automation of these bidding\nsystems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to\ntackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision\nTransformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential\nmodeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term\ndependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,\nconventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset\nreturn-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently\nproduced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,\nwhich is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to\nimprove the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the\nsuboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly\navailable bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its\nsuperiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories."}

This study then introduces\nBioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main\nabilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing\nsuch knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,\nand Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve\nlearned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,\nreal-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the\nneed for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in\nbioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM\nin Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of\nfour selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable\nresults compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a\nROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model\nachieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT\nvalues were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition,\nthe reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.\nBioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will\nbe made available via the following GitHub repository:\nhttps://github.com/amirap80/BioPars."}

Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the\ninternet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the\ndevelopment of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting\nbenchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM\nforecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a \"pastcasting\" benchmark\nwith hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already\nknown. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of\nthousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic \"forecasts\"\non past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can\nproduce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on\nat-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and\nchain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the\nrecently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track\nsteady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living\nbenchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing\ntraining data cutoff dates.

However, it\nremains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration\nconsistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across\na diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including\nhealth, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal\nforecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text\nrepresentations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large\nlanguage models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from\nmultimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and\nmodels, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest\nunimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we\ndisentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data\ncharacteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,\nincorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text\nmodels, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate\naligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when\n(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary\npredictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.\nOur empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be\nexpected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not."}

This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance\nclarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent\nrepresentations to improve speech stability.

In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer.

We propose to unify\nthese tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the\nneed for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However,\nunlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear\nlabels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To\novercome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with\nreinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose\nthe complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the\nworst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly\nreduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context\nlength during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate\nan IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation,\nrouting, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B\nachieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of\nsimilar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain\ndatasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the\nrobustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we\nconducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization\nexperiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on\nin-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement.\nSurprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the\nbase model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA.

Such\nmultidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are\ncentral to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources\nare evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network\nbandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to\ncapture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we\nstudy two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up\nto c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods\n(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'\npreferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each\ndimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a\ndifferent set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the\nstrong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the\nenvied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide\nupper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the\nexistence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are\nindependent of the total number of items. In addition, we present algorithms\nfor checking whether a weak or strong sEFc allocation exists. Moreover, we\nestablish NP-hardness results for checking the existence of weak sEF1 and\nstrong sEF1 allocations."}

We then train a conditional\ndiffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial\npower distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous\nsupported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low\nerror, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an\ninitializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach\non the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam\nsplitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes.

These changes are widely\nattributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in\nthe discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in\nfrequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.\nThe present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve\nthe replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, \"crucial\"\nreplacing \"essential\" and \"key,\" or whether they reflect broader semantic and\npragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective \"important\"\nshows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze\ndecreasing lexical items. Our analysis of \"collapsing\" words reveals a more\ncomplex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts\nwith the patterns of the abrupt spikes.

A key factor\nis that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking\nmechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a\nsimple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level\nspatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual\nprompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically\ndemonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning\ntasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by\n25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in\nscene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship\ntasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset.

Recent research has demonstrated that Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis\nand code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom\nproblems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application\nrequirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and\nlimited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill\ntelecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e.,\nover OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed\ncoordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the\nabstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens,\noffer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom\nchallenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical\nrepresentation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions\nwithin concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs\nin terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal\nintegration.
