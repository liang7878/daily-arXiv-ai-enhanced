Most existing methods rely on heuristic\nvertex matching orderings, which may significantly degrade enumeration\nperformance for certain queries. While learning-based optimizers have recently\ngained attention in the context of relational databases, they cannot be\ndirectly applied to subgraph queries due to the heterogeneous and\nschema-flexible nature of graph data, as well as the large number of joins\ninvolved in subgraph queries. These complexities often leads to inefficient\nonline performance, making such approaches impractical for real-world graph\ndatabase systems. To address this challenge, we propose NeuSO, a novel\nlearning-based optimizer for subgraph queries that achieves both high accuracy\nand efficiency. NeuSO features an efficient query graph encoder and an\nestimator which are trained using a multi-task framework to estimate both\nsubquery cardinality and execution cost.

However,\nin the class of deterministic Wheeler graphs (Gagie, Manzini, and Siren, TCS\n2017), we show that distinct $k$-mers of such a graph $W$ can be counted using\n$O(|W|k)$ or $O(n^4 \\log k)$ arithmetic operations, where $n$ is the number of\nvertices of the graph, and $|W|$ is $n$ plus the number of edges. The latter\nresult uses a new generalization of the technique of prefix doubling to Wheeler\ngraphs. To generalize our results beyond Wheeler graphs, we discuss ways to\ntransform a graph into a Wheeler graph in a manner that preserves the $k$-mers.\n  As an application of our $k$-mer counting algorithms, we construct a\nrepresentation of the de Bruijn graph (dBg) of the $k$-mers in time $O(|dBg| +\n|W|k)$. Given that the Wheeler graph can be exponentially smaller than the de\nBruijn graph, for large $k$ this provides a theoretical improvement over\nprevious de Bruijn graph construction methods from graphs, which must spend\n$\\Omega(k)$ time per $k$-mer in the graph.

This process\ngenerates a sequence of joint strategies $(s^t)_{t \\geq 0}$, where $s^t$\nrepresents the strategy profile of all agents at time step $t$. A widely\nadopted principle in MARL algorithms is \"win-stay, lose-shift\", which dictates\nthat an agent retains its current strategy if it achieves the best response.\nThis principle exhibits a fixed-point property when the joint strategy has\nbecome an equilibrium. The sequence of joint strategies under this principle is\nreferred to as a satisficing path, a concept first introduced in [40] and\nexplored in the context of $N$-player games in [39].

However, training deep SNNs has critically\ndepended on explicit normalization schemes, such as batch normalization,\nleading to a trade-off between performance and biological realism. To resolve\nthis conflict, we propose a normalization-free learning framework that\nincorporates lateral inhibition inspired by cortical circuits. Our framework\nreplaces the traditional feedforward SNN layer with a circuit of distinct\nexcitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons that complies with Dale's law. The\ncircuit dynamically regulates neuronal activity through subtractive and\ndivisive inhibition, which respectively control the activity and the gain of\nexcitatory neurons. To enable and stabilize end-to-end training of the\nbiologically constrained SNN, we propose two key techniques: E-I Init and E-I\nProp. E-I Init is a dynamic parameter initialization scheme that balances\nexcitatory and inhibitory inputs while performing gain control. E-I Prop\ndecouples the backpropagation of the E-I circuits from the forward propagation\nand regulates gradient flow. Experiments across several datasets and network\narchitectures demonstrate that our framework enables stable training of deep\nSNNs with biological realism and achieves competitive performance without\nresorting to explicit normalizations. Therefore, our work not only provides a\nsolution to training deep SNNs but also serves a computational platform for\nfurther exploring the functions of lateral inhibition in large-scale cortical\ncomputation."}

Larger values of N yield\nmore accurate estimates but at increased running time. Previous studies has\nprovided guidelines for selecting an optimal value of N to balance this\ntradeoff.

Several incidents of unintended\nprivacy loss have occurred due to numerical issues and inappropriate\nconfigurations of DP software, which have been successfully exploited in\nprivacy attacks. To better understand the seriousness of defective DP software,\nwe ask the following question: is it possible to elevate these passive defects\ninto active privacy attacks while maintaining covertness?\n  To address this question, we present the Gaussian pancake mechanism (GPM), a\nnovel mechanism that is computationally indistinguishable from the widely used\nGaussian mechanism (GM), yet exhibits arbitrarily weaker statistical DP\nguarantees. This unprecedented separation enables a new class of backdoor\nattacks: by indistinguishably passing off as the authentic GM, GPM can covertly\ndegrade statistical privacy. Unlike the unintentional privacy loss caused by\nGM's numerical issues, GPM is an adversarial yet undetectable backdoor attack\nagainst data privacy. We formally prove GPM's covertness, characterize its\nstatistical leakage, and demonstrate a concrete distinguishing attack that can\nachieve near-perfect success rates under suitable parameter choices, both\ntheoretically and empirically.\n  Our results underscore the importance of using transparent, open-source DP\nlibraries and highlight the need for rigorous scrutiny and formal verification\nof DP implementations to prevent subtle, undetectable privacy compromises in\nreal-world systems."}

The framework integrates three complementary modules: a Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN) for modeling static enterprise attributes, a Transformer-based\narchitecture for capturing long-term dependencies in historical financial time\nseries, and an Autoencoder (AE) for unsupervised detection of anomalous tax\nbehaviors. The outputs of these modules are fused to generate a comprehensive\nrisk score, which is further mapped into discrete risk levels (high, medium,\nlow).

As LLMs are increasingly\nutilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and\ncommodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological\ndecision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze\nLLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human\ngambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified\ncognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,\ngambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their\nown target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially\nalongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy\namplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a\nSparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract\ndecision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by\nprompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive\nbiases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data\npatterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial\napplications."}

We seek the seller's optimal pricing policy that resolves this\ntension. The main analytical challenge is that buyer type is two-dimensional\n(valuation and arrival time), which makes equilibrium intractable under general\nstrategies. To address this, we introduce the Value-Based Threshold (VBT)\nstrategy, a tractable framework that decouples these two dimensions.

This design provides fine-grained control over\naccuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across\nlayers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B\nparameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while\ndelivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,\nPATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while\nimproving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning\nmethod, MaskLLM."}

We propose a novel adaptive partitioning strategy\nthat automatically selects FV and DG subdomains: whenever the solution's cell\naverage violates the bounds, we switch to FV on a small neighborhood of that\nelement.

To address this challenge, we propose the\nSparse Deep Additive Model with Interactions (SDAMI), a framework that combines\nsparsity driven feature selection with deep subnetworks for flexible function\napproximation. Unlike conventional deep learning models, which often function\nas black boxes, SDAMI explicitly disentangles main effects and interaction\neffects to enhance interpretability. At the same time, its deep additive\nstructure achieves higher predictive accuracy than classical additive models.\nCentral to SDAMI is the concept of an Effect Footprint, which assumes that\nhigher order interactions project marginally onto main effects. Guided by this\nprinciple, SDAMI adopts a two stage strategy: first, identify strong main\neffects that implicitly carry information about important interactions. second,\nexploit this information through structured regularization such as group lasso\nto distinguish genuine main effects from interaction effects. For each selected\nmain effect, SDAMI constructs a dedicated subnetwork, enabling nonlinear\nfunction approximation while preserving interpretability and providing a\nstructured foundation for modeling interactions. Extensive simulations with\ncomparisons confirm SDAMI$'$s ability to recover effect structures across\ndiverse scenarios, while applications in reliability analysis, neuroscience,\nand medical diagnostics further demonstrate its versatility in addressing\nreal-world high-dimensional modeling challenges."}

Its only practical\ndisadvantage is the need for a second array, and thus twice the amount of\nmemory. This can be an impeding factor, especially when handling large amounts\nof data, where it is often either impractical or even impossible to fall back\nto slower or unstable sorting alternatives. Therefore, many attempts have been\nmade to fix this problem by adapting Mergesort to work in place. While it is\nknown that such algorithms exist, the previously published solutions are mostly\nnot efficient, become unstable, and/or are very complex.

Previous work has shown that decomposing\ntraining into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields\nsuperior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of\ncompute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive\nexperiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from\n86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final\nperformance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the\nloss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of\ncompute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide\nrange of model sizes and quantization widths using the\ntokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss\nscaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance\nacross different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We\nuse the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify\nexperimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory\nconstraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to\nfull-precision model accuracy.

This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that\nefficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we\npropose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups\nsemantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.\nBy inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic\nsignposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding\nthe model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench\nand POPE.

While vibe coding\nunder TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small\nyet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the\nexecution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively,\nand (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating\nfunctions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting.

Threats to the external\nvalidity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and\nsystem outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target\ndistribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust\nestimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to\nour approach is the use of \"persona\" ratings produced by prompting an LLM\nevaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific\nsociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these\ninformative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under\nevaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality\nestimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality\nestimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using\npersona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a\nreweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality.

Our claim is based on a novel analysis of scores in the\nsmall-$\\sigma$ regime that reveals a sharp separation of scales: information\nabout the data manifold is $\\Theta(\\sigma^{-2})$ stronger than information\nabout the distribution. We argue that this insight suggests a paradigm shift\nfrom the less practical goal of distributional learning to the more attainable\ntask of geometric learning, which provably tolerates $O(\\sigma^{-2})$ larger\nerrors in score approximation. We illustrate this perspective through three\nconsequences: i) in diffusion models, concentration on data support can be\nachieved with a score error of $o(\\sigma^{-2})$, whereas recovering the\nspecific data distribution requires a much stricter $o(1)$ error; ii) more\nsurprisingly, learning the uniform distribution on the manifold-an especially\nstructured and useful object-is also $O(\\sigma^{-2})$ easier; and iii) in\nBayesian inverse problems, the maximum entropy prior is $O(\\sigma^{-2})$ more\nrobust to score errors than generic priors.

Multi-model serving further complicates\nthese trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision\nbalances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the\npervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain\nlargely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees\nand general applicability.\n  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a\nmulti-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to\nexit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the\nability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for\nachieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that\nstrategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to\nthe optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the\noptimal trade-off in polynomial time.\n  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and\nearly-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks.

In fact, SPS-GAN can\ndiscover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary\nmeasurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve\nphysically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds\na Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To\ndiscover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional\ntime-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to\nencourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate\nthe utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry\ndiscovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on\npar with supervised models designed for single systems."}

The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the\nstrongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8%\non Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context\nLearning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector\nthat can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results\nprovide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy\nit as a practical, automated LM post-training option."}

Despite its importance, there is\ncurrently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration\nbetween humans and AI.

In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence\nof tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are\nlearned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of\nlabeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net\n(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling\nwearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing\nperformance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,\nacting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The\ntransformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across\nbody-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.\nMeanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge\nduring subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent\nfinal accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and\nregularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight\nConsolidation.

(iii) The\noversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among\nherbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment\nbased on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we\npropose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation\nmodel for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely\nTCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using\npatient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive\nlearning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous\ngraph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally\ncapture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a\nheterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing\nrelationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation\nprocess at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data\ndistribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one\nclinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR.

This\ntopology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first\ndrives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''\nform, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp\ngrowth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by\nphase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier.

To\nbridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the\nclassic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to\nFP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and\nformat-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of\nhigh-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible\noverhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of\nthe activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and\n2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on\nRTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches\nor outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the\npoint where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an\nautomatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock\na new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs."}

However, our\nexperimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a\ncontinue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,\nwe identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own\nstochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly\nresembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a\nvicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we\nintroduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed\nICRL (CV-ICRL).

Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,\nhave been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in\nreinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward\nor advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and\npreferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without\ncareful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased\nand may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage\nestimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without\npresuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses\ninto two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures\nwhich metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group\ncomparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In\nsummary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across\nthree LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks.

For realistic problems the space of parameters is\nhigh dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible\nor unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,\nintroduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural\nnetwork as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further\nsimplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting\nsubspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace.

Its training combines\nthree advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent\nself-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source\ngrounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes\nmulti-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum\npruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and\n(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive\nbehavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory\nbreadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of\ntool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is\nFathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn\nDeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for\ncomprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,\nWebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating\nstrong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,\nGPQA-Diamond, and MedQA."}

To address the challenge of missing\ndata, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework\nthat uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting\non the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there\nis no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process\nsusceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we\nconduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct\nsupervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade\nprediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves\naway from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time\nseries. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a\nnovel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a\nunified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to\nlearn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values\nwhile preserving essential predictive signals.

This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series\nforecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by\neliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and\nmulti-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more\nflexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a\nhyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding\nwindow and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider\nlead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model\nmulti-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message\npassing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the\nconsistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock\ndatasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both\nefficiency and accuracy."}

V2X cooperative perception systems are software\nsystems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying\nfusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.\nTherefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational\nchallenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous\npredictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain\ninsufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by\nconducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically\nevaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception\nperformance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in\ncooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of\nthe critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and\nidentify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation\nconfiguration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)\nVehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication\nexhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion\nschemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher\nfrequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not\nrobust against communication interference when running online.

Unlike deep learning (DL)\napproaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach\nalso avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more\nlightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with\nsupervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully\nCSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with\nadjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature\nselection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to\njointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder.

Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining\nweights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with\nhardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to\nsignificant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training\nwith massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large\nnumber of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because\nthese weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable\nescape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.\nTo address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization\noptimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing\nthem as dynamic biases.

This raises a critical question for\nthe field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work\ndemonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model\nparameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three\ninterpretations are possible, with relative differences between different\ninterpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps\nsurprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not\nmeaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the\ncompute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio.

We operationalize this insight\nthrough Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of\nvanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive\nand non-sensitive tokens.

MetaAPO employs a\nlightweight meta-learner, as an \"alignment gap estimator\", to evaluate the\npotential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This\nguides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the\noptimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of\nonline and offline data.

While deep networks\nlearn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities\nthat contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by\nintroducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.\nEach GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a\nglobal, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax\nprediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces\nthat feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,\nacting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR\nintroduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive\nweighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.\nThis allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress\nnoisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or\ntraining procedure.

To\naddress this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that\njointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance\nshort-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our\nbest-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected\nCalibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both\npredictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of\nthe uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision\nsupport, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting\nlow-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire\ndanger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast\nhorizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with\ntime, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic\nuncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty\ntypes may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary\ninsights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their\njoint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach\nsignificantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger\nforecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems."}

To address the challenge of missing\ndata, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework\nthat uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting\non the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there\nis no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process\nsusceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we\nconduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct\nsupervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade\nprediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves\naway from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time\nseries. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a\nnovel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a\nunified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to\nlearn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values\nwhile preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on\nfour real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts\naccurately even under high missing rates.

However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical\nconcerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this\npaper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of\nthese judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges\nfinetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by\nfuture models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well\njudges generalize to unseen questions at test time.

Existing studies\nhave observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them\noften come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this\ntrade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates\nbetween compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically\nadjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase\ncuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable\ndecisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens\nand increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length\nlimit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon\nsettings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the\nmodel's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily\npushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency\ntrade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves\nperformance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three\niterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other\nmethods (Figure 1).

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies.

Using simulated jet\ndatasets, we compare these networks against unconstrained baselines in terms of\nclassification performance, robustness to soft emissions, and latent\nrepresentation structures. Our analysis shows that physics-aware networks are\nmore stable across training instances and distribute their latent variance\nacross multiple interpretable directions. By regressing Energy Flow Polynomials\nonto the leading principal components, we establish a direct correspondence\nbetween learned representations and established IRC-safe jet observables. These\nresults demonstrate that embedding symmetry and safety constraints not only\nimproves robustness but also grounds network representations in known QCD\nstructures, providing a principled approach toward interpretable deep learning\nin collider physics."}

Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text\nencoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on\nmitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings.

This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs\nto fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we\nanalyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the\nwidely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based\non parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech\nintroduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation\nof parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this\ninsight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate\nscheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original\nparameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better\nmaintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving\ndownstream spoken question answering performance.

While\nour focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal\nstep size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the\npredictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent\nmethod."}

However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical\nconcerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment.

Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text\nencoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on\nmitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings.

However, these platforms are increasingly misused to\ndisseminate harmful audio content, such as hate speech, deceptive\nadvertisements, and explicit material, which can have significant negative\nconsequences (e.g., detrimental effects on mental health). In response,\nresearchers and practitioners have been actively developing and deploying audio\ncontent moderation tools to tackle this issue. Despite these efforts, malicious\nactors can bypass moderation systems by making subtle alterations to audio\ncontent, such as modifying pitch or inserting noise. Moreover, the\neffectiveness of modern audio moderation tools against such adversarial inputs\nremains insufficiently studied. To address these challenges, we propose MTAM, a\nMetamorphic Testing framework for Audio content Moderation software.\nSpecifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2000 audio clips and define 14\nmetamorphic relations across two perturbation categories: Audio Features-Based\nand Heuristic perturbations. MTAM applies these metamorphic relations to toxic\naudio content to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more\nlikely to evade detection.

To address these challenges, a skeleton-based\nrobust registration framework is presented, which introduces a\ncorruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness\nand accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the\nregistration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the\ncorrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal\nregistration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to\nenforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which\nsignificantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures\nthat the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the\nglobal stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate\nregistration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets\ndemonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration\nmethods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,\nnoise contamination, and geometric deformations.

A key component of these systems is the shared\nfunction library, a collection of software tools that agents use to process\nsensor data and navigate complex driving environments. Despite its critical\nrole in agent decision-making, the function library remains an under-explored\nvulnerability. In this paper, we introduce FuncPoison, a novel poisoning-based\nattack targeting the function library to manipulate the behavior of LLM-driven\nmulti-agent autonomous systems. FuncPoison exploits two key weaknesses in how\nagents access the function library: (1) agents rely on text-based instructions\nto select tools; and (2) these tools are activated using standardized command\nformats that attackers can replicate. By injecting malicious tools with\ndeceptive instructions, FuncPoison manipulates one agent s decisions--such as\nmisinterpreting road conditions--triggering cascading errors that mislead other\nagents in the system. We experimentally evaluate FuncPoison on two\nrepresentative multi-agent autonomous driving systems, demonstrating its\nability to significantly degrade trajectory accuracy, flexibly target specific\nagents to induce coordinated misbehavior, and evade diverse defense mechanisms.\nOur results reveal that the function library, often considered a simple\ntoolset, can serve as a critical attack surface in LLM-based autonomous driving\nsystems, raising elevated concerns on their reliability."}

However,\ntraditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal\ndependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and\nlimited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this\nwork, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous\nsamples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples\nare markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as\nscattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample\nrepresentations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance\nspatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model\nrepresentation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD\nincorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering\nand a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared\nerror minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive\nfusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and\ntopological representations.

We introduce Cogito,\nergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language\nModel (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its\nenvironment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state\nwith no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of\ninteraction and reflection.

We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,\nMinesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent\nsuccessfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their\nrules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards.

Project Page https://johann.wang/Light-SQ/", "summary": "In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on\nimage-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context,\nprimitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios\nby compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations.\nTowards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be\nstructure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware\nalignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel\nsuperquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes\nstructure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to\niteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap\nbetween primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by\nstructure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to\ndrive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on\nSDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In\naddition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement\nto preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce\n3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both\nreconstruction quality and primitive-level editability.

Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting\na model's \"self-knowledge\", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its\nown answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some\nprivileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the\nmodel itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict\nthe correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an\nunrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a\n\"Correctness Model\" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical\npredictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness\ninformation, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that\nGCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns\nfor correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use\nCMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its\ngeneralization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that\nanswer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore\nalternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that\nincluding history as in-context examples can help improve correctness\nprediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in\ncalibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families\nand the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective\nprediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a\ngeneralizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding\ncorrectness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on\nself-introspection."}

We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring\nthe average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and\nalso show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our\ntools. Our \\mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage\nrecipe: cold-start supervised finetuning to instill long-horizon search\nbehaviors, followed by reinforcement learning which significantly improves\nreasoning-driven tool use. With our methods, InfoAgent achieves 15.3\\% accuracy\non BrowseComp, 29.2\\% on BrowseComp-ZH, and 40.4\\% on Xbench-DS, outperforming\nprior open-source deep research agents such as WebSailor-72B and DeepDive-32B."}
