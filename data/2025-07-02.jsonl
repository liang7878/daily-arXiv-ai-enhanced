In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a\ntraining-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies:\ndynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating\nthe GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual\nelements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality\nindependently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions\nare ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by\ngenerating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions\nand incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This\nhierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts\nwithout the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our\napproach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent\nimprovements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness\nof combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning."}

These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent\ndocumentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for\naccurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table\nextraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor\nperformance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This\npaper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be\nextracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,\ncausing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a\nnovel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically\nenriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text\nlinearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve\nboth structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental\nevaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates\nTalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering\ntasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS\nTextract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that\nthe Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management\napplications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic\nanalysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines,\n(2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation,\n(3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as\nend-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks\nshowing substantial improvements across multiple categories."}

In a conceptual breakthrough,\nWang et al (2025) formulated Metropolis-Hastings as a Markov decision process,\nopening up the possibility for adaptive tuning using Reinforcement Learning\n(RL). Their emphasis was on theoretical foundations; realising the practical\nbenefit of Reinforcement Learning Metropolis-Hastings (RLMH) was left for\nsubsequent work. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we observe the\nsurprising result that natural choices of reward, such as the acceptance rate,\nor the expected squared jump distance, provide insufficient signal for training\nRLMH. Instead, we propose a novel reward based on the contrastive divergence,\nwhose superior performance in the context of RLMH is demonstrated. Second, we\nexplore the potential of RLMH and present adaptive gradient-based samplers that\nbalance flexibility of the Markov transition kernel with learnability of the\nassociated RL task. A comprehensive simulation study using the posteriordb\nbenchmark supports the practical effectiveness of RLMH."}

Existing characterizations of\ncompute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens\nin isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating\npoints. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general\nframework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned\nskill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive\nclosed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range\nof inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought\n(ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and\nmodel capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite\ngraph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge\nDS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We\ntheoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy\nscaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies\nas a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior\nelicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling;\nand both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified\nanalytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference\ninterdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports\nprincipled algorithmic design and resource allocation."}

It proposes an\noptimization method for elastic cloud resource scaling based on a multi-agent\nsystem. The method deploys multiple autonomous agents to perceive resource\nstates in parallel and make local decisions. While maintaining the distributed\nnature of the system, it introduces a collaborative value function to achieve\nglobal coordination. This improves the responsiveness of resource scheduling\nand enhances overall system performance. To strengthen system foresight, a\nlightweight state prediction model is designed.

This is mainly attributed to the relatively large complexity of\nqueries in graph databases. When translating graph queries into arithmetic\ncircuits, the circuit scale can be too large to be practically evaluated. To\naddress this issue, we propose to break down graph queries into more\nfine-grained, primitive operators, enabling a step-by-step evaluation through\nsmaller-scale circuits. Accordingly, the verification with ZKP circuits of\ncomplex graph queries can be decomposed into a series of composable\ncryptographic primitives, each designed to verify a fundamental structural\nproperty such as path ordering or edge directionality. Especially, having\nnoticed that the graph expansion (i.e., traversing from nodes to their\nneighbors along edges) operation serves as the backbone of graph query\nevaluation, we design the expansion centric operator decomposition. In addition\nto constructing circuits for the expansion primitives, we also design\nspecialized ZKP circuits for the various attributes that augment this\ntraversal. The circuits are meticulously designed to take advantage of PLONKish\narithmetization.

Multiple data container\nconnections create a cohesive wide-area storage network, ensuring resilience\nusing erasure coding policies. Furthermore, a load-balancing algorithm ensures\nequitable and efficient utilization of storage resources. We evaluate DynoStore\nusing benchmarks and real-world case studies, including the management of\nmedical and satellite data across geographically distributed environments.

However, it has\nbeen observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is\nsusceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this\nissue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation\nclassification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we\npropose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new\nconcept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial\nattacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an\nAdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an\nadversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we\ncombine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural\nnetwork model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to\ndetecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into\nthe operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism.\nWe show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT,\ninfluencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in\nthe input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through\nexperimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several\ncompetitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those\nutilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and\nbasic iterative method."}

While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have\nbeen developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of\ndimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a\npromising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from\npoor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the\ntarget distribution is highly multi-modal.

Second, we cast the candidate selection\nproblem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising\ncandidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.\nDuring posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly\nmulti-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when\nconstraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate\nthis issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the\nlatent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data\nspace.

Their emphasis was on theoretical foundations; realising the practical\nbenefit of Reinforcement Learning Metropolis-Hastings (RLMH) was left for\nsubsequent work. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we observe the\nsurprising result that natural choices of reward, such as the acceptance rate,\nor the expected squared jump distance, provide insufficient signal for training\nRLMH. Instead, we propose a novel reward based on the contrastive divergence,\nwhose superior performance in the context of RLMH is demonstrated. Second, we\nexplore the potential of RLMH and present adaptive gradient-based samplers that\nbalance flexibility of the Markov transition kernel with learnability of the\nassociated RL task. A comprehensive simulation study using the posteriordb\nbenchmark supports the practical effectiveness of RLMH."}

Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to\nthe modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics\nfail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately\naddress class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This\nstudy addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs\n-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the\nbalanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly\ncaptures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal\nregression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit\nmodel from econometrics to neural networks.

In this work, we leverage a\nlarge-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital\nContact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast\nmobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial\nsparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits\nthe predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we\npropose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN)\ntechnique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its\nimmediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting\nbackbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input\nlengths.

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies.

First, we quantify instance difficulty\nusing PVI and filter out low-difficulty instances enabling a static approach.\nExperiments demonstrate that removing 10%-30% of the data preserves the\nclassifier performance with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% loss in accuracy.Second, we\nuse a progressive learning approach to training the classifiers on instances\nsorted by ascending PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy\ngain over conventional training. Our results suggest that with the effective\ndata reduction strategy, training a classifier on the selected optimal subset\ncould enhance the model performance and boost training efficiency. Moreover, we\nhave transferred the PVI framework, which previously applied only to English\ndatasets, to diverse Chinese NLP tasks and base models, leading to valuable\ninsights for cross-lingual data reduction and faster training.

By linking empirical behavioral data to the\ninterface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) constructed by the automated\ngraph-based execution framework (AutoGraph), the InSight-R framework enables\nautomated HFE identification based on both error-prone and time-deviated\noperational paths. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between\ndesigner-user conflicts and human error. The results demonstrate that InSight-R\nnot only enhances the objectivity and interpretability of HFE identification\nbut also provides a scalable pathway toward dynamic, real-time human\nreliability assessment in digitalized control environments.

This is a\npressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect\nreciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others.\nHere, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide\n21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate\n-- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these\ninteractions should be judged.

While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have\nbeen developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of\ndimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a\npromising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from\npoor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the\ntarget distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new\nframework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages.\nFirst, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and\nsurrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations\nwith uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection\nproblem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising\ncandidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.\nDuring posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly\nmulti-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when\nconstraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate\nthis issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the\nlatent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data\nspace.

To enhance the\nrepresentational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the\nfirst 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset\nfeaturing global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single\nyear, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling\nstrategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based\ncontrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training.\nComprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS\ntasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior\ncharacteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter\nefficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the\nexceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader\nand more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application."}

In this work, we develop a SINDy variant that is able to robustly and\nefficiently identify slow-fast dynamics in two steps: (i) identify the slow\nmanifold, that is, an algebraic equation for the fast variables as functions of\nthe slow ones, and (ii) learn a model for the dynamics of the slow variables\nrestricted to the manifold. Critically, the equation learned in (i) is\nleveraged to build a manifold-informed function library for (ii) that contains\nonly essential higher-order nonlinearites as candidate terms. Rather than\ncontaining all monomials of up to a certain degree, the resulting custom\nlibrary is a sparse subset of the latter that is tailored to the specific\nproblem at hand. The approach is demonstrated on numerical examples of a\nsnap-through buckling beam and the flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil. We find that\nour method significantly reduces both the condition number and the size of the\nSINDy library, thus enabling accurate identification of the dynamics on slow\nmanifolds."}
