By leveraging domain-approved\nconnections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical\nconcept representations by incorporating contextual information from related\nconcepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating\ndomain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology\nsystems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without\nintegrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept\nrepresentation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,\noverlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a\nlarge language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework\nthat leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis\nknowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to\nenhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first\nemploys LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology\nconcept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept\ndescriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context.

However, because\nthey have high computational throughput, they can lead to significant\nperformance gains in other algorithms if they can be successfully exploited. We\nexamine using TCs to compute Euclidean distance calculations, which are used in\nmany data analytics applications. Prior work has only investigated using 64 bit\nfloating point (FP64) data for computation; however, TCs can operate on lower\nprecision floating point data (i.e., 16 bit matrix multiplication and 32 bit\naccumulation), which we refer to as FP16-32.

To achieve high computational\nthroughput, we design FaSTED for significant hierarchical reuse of data and\nmaximize memory utilization at every level (global memory, shared memory, and\nregisters). We apply FaSTED to the application of similarity searches, which\ntypically employ an indexing data structure to eliminate superfluous Euclidean\ndistance calculations.

This can lead to\nimprovements on area and power efficiency in RNL neuron implementation.\nPlace-and-route results show Catwalk is 1.39x and 1.86x better in area and\npower, respectively, as compared to existing SRM0-RNL neurons.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCatwalk\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4f18\u5316RNL\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u529f\u7387\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CMOS\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b9e\u73b0\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u5143top - k\u5c06\u8109\u51b2 volley \u4e2d\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u6392\u5e8f\u5b50\u96c6\u7c07\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u540e\u7eed\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5e03\u5c40\u5e03\u7ebf\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCatwalk\u5728\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u529f\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709SRM0 - RNL\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u597d1.39\u500d\u548c1.86\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Catwalk\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347RNL\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u529f\u7387\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The latter setup raises the prospect of divergent\ndelivery: ad delivery algorithms may target different ad variants to different\naudience segments.

FL can be categorized into centralized and\ndecentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to\naggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,\ncommunication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the\ndecentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides\nimproved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in\nleveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this\napproach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal\nmodels in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this\nchallenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),\nwhich replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk\nupdates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized\nversions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data\nand introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial\nrandom walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model\nupdate. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a\nquantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves\nconvergence upper bound of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex\nconditions. Furthermore, we propose a sufficient condition that reveals when\nquantization balances communication and convergence.

Using data from the German\nPanel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS) from 2008 to 2020, linked\nwith administrative data from Germany's Federal Employment Agency (PASS-ADIAB),\nthis study reconstructs households' benefit receipt and income histories, even\nduring non-survey periods. This allows modelling benefit non-take-up for\neligible households using the duration and frequency of past benefit receipt.\nIn addition, the use of administrative data mitigates bias from self-reported\nbenefit receipt. Household eligibility for UB II is simulated using GETTSIM, an\nopen-source microsimulation model, applied to the PASS dataset for the first\ntime.\n  Findings indicate that long-term factors significantly influence the\nprobability of claiming UB II.

LMPA identifies user-defined functions that resemble system APIs\nand models them accordingly, thereby mitigating erroneous cross-calling-context\npropagation. Furthermore, it enhances summary-based analysis by inferring\ninitial points-to sets and introducing a novel summary strategy augmented with\nnatural language. Finally, we discuss the key challenges involved in realizing\nthis vision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLMPA\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6307\u9488\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u613f\u666f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u9488\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u56e0\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u51fd\u6570\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u673a\u9047\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7cfb\u7edfAPI\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u65ad\u521d\u59cb\u6307\u5411\u96c6\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6458\u8981\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51faLMPA\u613f\u666f\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Measures such as the Economic Complexity Index\n(ECI) and the Product Space have proven their worth as robust estimators of an\neconomy's subsequent growth; less obvious, however, is how they have come to be\nso. Despite ECI drawing its micro-foundations from a combinatorial model of\ncapabilities, where a set of homogeneous capabilities combine to form products\nand the economies which can produce them, such a model is consistent with\nneither the fact that distinct product classes draw on distinct capabilities,\nnor the interrelations between different products in the Product Space which so\nmuch of economic complexity is based upon.\n  In this paper, we extend the combinatorial model of economic complexity\nthrough two innovations: an underlying network which governs the relatedness\nbetween capabilities, and a production function which trades the original\nbinary specialization function for a fine-grained, product-level output\nfunction. Using country-product trade data across 216 countries, 5000 products\nand two decades, we show that this model is able to accurately replicate both\nthe characteristic topology of the Product Space and the complexity\ndistribution of countries' export baskets. In particular, the model bridges the\ngap between the ECI and capabilities by transforming measures of economic\ncomplexity into direct measures of the capabilities held by an economy - a\ntransformation shown to both improve the informativeness of the Economic\nComplexity Index in predicting economic growth and enable an interpretation of\neconomic complexity as a proxy for productive structure in the form of\ncapability substitutability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u521b\u65b0\u6269\u5c55\u7ecf\u6d4e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u8d38\u6613\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u590d\u5236\u4ea7\u54c1\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u51fa\u53e3\u7bee\u5b50\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ecf\u6d4e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6307\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ecf\u6d4e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4ea7\u54c1\u9700\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u4ea7\u54c1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4ea7\u54c1\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u521b\u65b0\u6269\u5c55\u7ecf\u6d4e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5373\u5f15\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ea7\u4ea7\u51fa\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528216\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u30015000\u79cd\u4ea7\u54c1\u3001\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6 - \u4ea7\u54c1\u8d38\u6613\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u5236\u4ea7\u54c1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u51fa\u53e3\u7bee\u5b50\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u6d4e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8861\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6307\u6570\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6307\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u7ecf\u6d4e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ee5\u80fd\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods\nare mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to\ncomprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing\nto directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate\nprediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle\ncommonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to\nconsider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex\ninteractions between modalities.\n  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based\nMulti-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through\nprediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal\nFeature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,\nand the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC\nModule extract synergistic, common, and special information among different\nmodalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,\nimproving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among\ndifferent features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the\nFDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise.

The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics,\nrooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest\nin applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges.\nHere, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from\nbiological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression.

Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the\nstates are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the\natoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not\nfull STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the\nactions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different\nversions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the\ntraces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all\nobservable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as\nthe atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,\nand the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not\nthe ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the\nlearning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,\nwhere certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions\nwhich can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The\nlearning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+\nstate-action traces.

The purpose of this study was to experiment\nwith different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly\npinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and\ncontinue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space\nmissions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine\nlearning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive\nanalysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets\nthrough statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained\nand tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a\nreinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on\nseverity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each\nanomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time\nthrough human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have\nalso implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,\nparsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program\nor script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,\nwe were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,\ncompleting the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped\naround and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning\nwas utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous\ndata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u501f\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u52a9\u529bDSN\u5929\u7ebf\u8bbe\u65bd\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u9000\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b8c\u5584\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "motivation": "DSN\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u957f\u671f\u8fd0\u884c\u4f1a\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u822a\u5929\u5668\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u9700\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7ea7\uff0c\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6210DSN\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eDSN\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u7ef4\u62a4\u8fd0\u8425\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are\nrigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,\nrequiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures\ndepend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent\nin wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both\nmultidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological\nscience and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z\nnumbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score\n(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,\nparticipants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral\ndilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which\nwere mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of\neach individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with\nmembership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In\na proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom\nrepresentations that correlated modestly but significantly with established\nscales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting\nconvergent and divergent validity.

However, long post-click\nbehavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume\nof data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training\nand inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage\napproaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete\nutilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating\nmultimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents\nsignificant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens\nand mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the\nmodel's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest\nNetwork (DMGIN).

To mitigate the potential information loss from\ngrouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors\nwithin each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers\nto capture group traits.

Risks are also inherently related to compliance with the new\nlegislation. Objective: The paper investigates how risks are framed in the EU's\nfive core cyber security legislative acts, whether the framings indicate\nconvergence or divergence between the acts and their risk concepts, and what\nqualifying words and terms are used when describing the legal notions of risks.\nMethod : The paper's methodology is based on qualitative legal interpretation\nand taxonomy-building. Results: The five acts have an encompassing coverage of\ndifferent cyber security risks, including but not limited to risks related to\ntechnical, organizational, and human security as well as those not originating\nfrom man-made actions. Both technical aspects and assets are used to frame the\nlegal risk notions in many of the legislative acts. A threat-centric viewpoint\nis also present in one of the acts. Notable gaps are related to acceptable\nrisks, non-probabilistic risks, and residual risks. Conclusion: The EU's new\ncyber security legislation has significantly extended the risk-based approach\nto regulations. At the same time, complexity and compliance burden have\nincreased.

While existing research\npredominantly focuses on model-level security threats, vulnerabilities within\nthe LLM dependency supply chain have been overlooked. To fill this gap, we\nconducted an empirical analysis of 52 open-source LLMs, examining their\nthird-party dependencies and associated vulnerabilities.

Finally, we compared third-party\ndependency vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem to those in the Python\necosystem.

While\nML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate\naerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly\nevolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single\nmodel demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel\nmeta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a\nstrength.

The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,\nassigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in\npredicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model\ncollapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy\nregularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is\ntrained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark\nof high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative\nresults demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2\nprediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most\naccurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities.

In this work, we introduce\nRelevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution\npatching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance\nPropagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the\nlayers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local\npropagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or\nimproved signal-to-noise ratio.

We validate RelP across a range of models and\ntasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than\nstandard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and\nMLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task.

A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the\nmodel after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs\nprohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine\nunlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove\nsensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.\nRecently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by\nintegrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information\nto identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA\nadapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires\naccess to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental\nassumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in\nimportance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel\nunlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in\nFILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget\nset. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling\nparameter identification without accessing the entire model.

However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over\nextended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task\nof generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series\nexhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also\nundergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term\ndependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the\nother hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships\nbetween different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing\nboth intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important\nchallenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative\nmodel for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through\nstage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model\npreserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data\ndistribution shifts.

Thus, in many applications, optimizing\nthe long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.\nIn this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard\nensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term\nperformance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator\nfor the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative\nreward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.\nTo address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified\ngeometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an\nestimator for the time-average growth rate.

To address this inefficiency, we propose\nR-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on\nproblem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both\nthinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply\nBi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in\ndetermining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first\ntrain the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which\ncontains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a\nsecond phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy\nmodel is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.\nExperimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross 25 challenging benchmarks.

Building on this, we show that GNN-based\nSAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range\ndependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.\nWe validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm\nthat curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used\nto predict performance.

This paper evaluates PINNs'\ncapabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their\nperformance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three\nkey experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory\nprediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions\n(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we\ndemonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in\nerror reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic\ngrid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and\nexpert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic\nperformance.

Evaluation of\nthe HCQA on a QSC that consists of two qubits and a sequence of Rx, Ry, and S\ngates demonstrates its efficiency in generating optimal QSCs with a QFI of 1.\nThis work highlights the synergy between AI-driven learning and quantum\ncomputation, illustrating how intelligent agents can autonomously discover\noptimal quantum circuit designs for enhanced sensing and estimation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHCQA\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8QFI\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7535\u8def\u3002", "method": "HCQA\u96c6\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eQ\u503c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7f16\u7801\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u548c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217Rx\u3001Ry\u3001S\u95e8\u7ec4\u6210\u7684QSC\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cHCQA\u80fd\u751f\u6210QFI\u4e3a1\u7684\u6700\u4f18QSC\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

To manage user\nheterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term\nphysiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a\ndiscriminative representation space.

Experiments across GLUE\ntasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,\nstandard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular\nvalue decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x\ncompared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faQR - LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7QR\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u53d6\u6b63\u4ea4\u57fa\u8868\u8fbeLoRA\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u7528\u6781\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u5c31\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u6807\u51c6LoRA\u548cSVD - LoRA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5f00\u53d1\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709SVD\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684LoRA\u53d8\u79cd\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u96be\u89e3\u91ca\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5e26\u5217\u4e3b\u5143\u7684QR\u5206\u89e3\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6b63\u4ea4\u57fa\uff0c\u5c06LoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u91cf\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728GLUE\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cQR - LoRA\u7528601\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u5c31\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u6807\u51c6LoRA\u548cSVD - LoRA\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u51cf\u5c11\u8d851000\u500d\uff0c\u6bd4\u5178\u578bLoRA\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5c1177\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "QR - LoRA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u4ee5\u6781\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address both privacy\nand fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent\nIntervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational\nautoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular\ndata. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a\ntask-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus\noffering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\\'enyi\ndifferential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness\nin the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for\ngroup-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent\nspace, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across\nprotected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure\nextending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC).

We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked\nto navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to\ntargets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead\nto deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only\nprovides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees\nnon-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of\ninterest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\\times K}$ cost structure that\ndescribes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport\nthen provides \\textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the\nrobots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling\nconsiderations.

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u2018\u5e38\u6001\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b83\u662f\u5bf9\u6b63\u5e38\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e38\u6001\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u672c\u8d28\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u5e38\u6001\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8bc4\u5224\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u662f\u5bf9\u6b63\u5e38\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982ChatGPT\u96be\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e00\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u806a\u660e\u800c\u975e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u5f52\u7ed3\u4e3a\u6b63\u5e38/\u5e73\u5747\u601d\u7ef4\u3002"}}

Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but\ncurrent methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper\nexplores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement\nLearning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a\n7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first\nstrategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a\nnovel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks.

TL uses a\npretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it\nremains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational\nmeasurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more\ncomplex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit\nor a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning\n(CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can\nalso address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step\nand fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to\nincorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and\naddress the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building\nthermal dynamics is still missing.\n  Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a\nmodel trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building\noperation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data\nrepresentative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios\nwith concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL\nstrategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements\nthan existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort.\nSML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1\\% without concept\ndrifts and 34.9\\% with concept drifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cdCL\u548cTL\u7b56\u7565\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u7b51\u70ed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSML\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "Transfer Learning\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5efa\u6a21\u5efa\u7b51\u70ed\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u540e\u7eed\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u5e94\u5bf9\u5efa\u7b51\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7efc\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cdCL\u548cTL\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e2d\u6b27\u5355\u6237\u4f4f\u5b855 - 7\u5e74\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSeasonal Memory Learning\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "SML\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709CL\u548cTL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5927\uff0c\u65e0\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u51c628.1%\uff0c\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e34.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "SML\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u4ee5\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u3002"}}

However, they remain vulnerable to\nhallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.\nPrevious video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos.

Thus, they often address this problem\npartially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,\nreconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the\ninput views.

Project Website:\n  https://nishitanand.github.io/line-level-ocr-website", "summary": "Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each\ncharacter and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character\nsegmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in\nsequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first\ndetecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly\noutput full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of\nlanguage models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe\nthat the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word\nsegmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical\nprogression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to\nbypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for\nbetter utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not\nonly improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough\nliterature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark\nsuch shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a\nmeticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level\nannotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy\nimprovement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning\ntowards line-level OCR, especially for document images.

Experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our \\method consistently enhances the quality of\nseed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on\naverage while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a\nnew paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution\nof data and models.
