### [1] [The Second Law of Intelligence: Controlling Ethical Entropy in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10704)
*Samih Fadli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出无约束人工智能遵循类似热力学第二定律，定义伦理熵，证明其导数非负，推导对齐工作临界边界，模拟验证理论，为AI对齐提供热力学控制框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工智能的稳定性和安全性问题，将AI对齐转化为可量化问题。

Method: 定义伦理熵，证明其时间导数性质，推导临界边界，进行模拟验证。

Result: 模拟显示无约束模型熵增加，有对齐工作的系统保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架为维护高级自主系统的稳定性和安全性提供定量基础。

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

### [2] [Co-EPG: A Framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding in Autonomous GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10705)
*Yuan Zhao,Hualei Zhu,Tingyu Jiang,Shen Li,Xiaohang Xu,Hao Henry Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Co - EPG框架解决当前GUI任务自动化方法局限，在基准测试中表现优，建立新训练范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI任务自动化方法存在未充分利用跨模型协同和过度依赖合成数据的问题。

Method: 提出Co - EPG自迭代训练框架，建立迭代正反馈循环，通过GRPO优化规划模型，生成数据优化接地模型。

Result: 在Multimodal - Mind2Web和AndroidControl基准测试中，三轮迭代后超越现有方法，每次迭代能力提升。

Conclusion: 建立了GUI代理从孤立优化到集成、自驱动协同进化的新训练范式。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

### [3] [Picking a Representative Set of Solutions in Multiobjective Optimization: Axioms, Algorithms, and Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10716)
*Niclas Boehmer,Maximilian T. Wittmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文将Pareto剪枝问题转化为多胜者投票问题，对现有质量度量进行公理分析，提出新度量directed coverage，分析计算复杂度并实验评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为减少决策者认知负担，解决Pareto剪枝问题中现有质量度量存在的不合理行为。

Method: 将Pareto剪枝重新定义为多胜者投票问题，进行公理分析，分析计算复杂度，开展实验评估。

Result: 发现现有质量度量的不合理行为，确定了不同情况下计算复杂度的边界，实验表明质量度量选择对解集特征有决定性影响，提出的directed coverage表现良好。

Conclusion: 提出的directed coverage度量在多种场景下有竞争力，质量度量的选择至关重要。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

### [4] [Structure-Aware Encodings of Argumentation Properties for Clique-width](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10767)
*Yasir Mahmood,Markus Hecher,Johanna Groven,Johannes K. Fichte*

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代SAT求解器在树宽小的实例上高效，团宽作为更一般的图参数，其编码研究较少，因此研究团宽的编码能力。

Method: 以抽象论证为研究对象，设计从论证问题到(Q)SAT的新型归约，线性保留团宽，得到DDG归约。

Result: 为所有论证语义建立了新结果，包括计数，且在合理假设下，DDG归约的开销无法显著改善。

Conclusion: 通过DDG归约研究团宽的编码能力是有效的，且当前归约的开销优化存在局限。

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

### [5] [Potential Outcome Rankings for Counterfactual Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10776)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究新的反事实决策规则，以应对不确定性下的决策问题。

Method: 引入PoR和PoB两个新指标，建立识别定理，推导指标边界，给出估计方法。

Result: 进行数值实验说明了估计量的有限样本性质，并展示了其在真实数据集上的应用。

Conclusion: 新指标及相关方法可用于反事实决策，具有一定应用价值。

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

### [6] [From Efficiency to Adaptivity: A Deeper Look at Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10788)
*Chao Wu,Baoheng Li,Mingchen Gao,Zhenyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文从适应性角度重新审视大语言模型推理，提出三项贡献并对现有方法分类，最后指出开放挑战。

Result: 明确不同机制在实践中实现自适应推理的方式，可对不同策略进行系统比较。

Conclusion: 指出自我评估、元推理和人类对齐推理控制方面的开放挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

Result: 初步部署显示有良好效果。

Conclusion: 结合专家协作和迭代推理，HARNESS可提高预测安全系统的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Operational safety at mission-critical work sites is a top priority given the complex and hazardous nature of daily tasks. This paper presents the Human-Agent Risk Navigation and Event Safety System (HARNESS), a modular AI framework designed to forecast hazardous events and analyze operational risks in U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) environments. HARNESS integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured work data, historical event retrieval, and risk analysis to proactively identify potential hazards. A human-in-the-loop mechanism allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to refine predictions, creating an adaptive learning loop that enhances performance over time. By combining SME collaboration with iterative agentic reasoning, HARNESS improves the reliability and efficiency of predictive safety systems. Preliminary deployment shows promising results, with future work focusing on quantitative evaluation of accuracy, SME agreement, and decision latency reduction.

Conclusion: AIonopedia能加速现实世界中离子液体的发现。

Abstract: The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

Method: 提出HyperComplEx框架，通过学习注意力机制自适应结合双曲、复数和欧几里得空间，采用关系特定的空间加权策略和多空间一致性损失。

Result: 在不同规模的计算机科学研究知识图谱和标准基准测试中，结果显著优于现有基线，在1000万篇论文数据集上MRR达0.612，相对最佳基线提升4.8%，每三元组推理时间85毫秒，模型通过自适应维度分配近乎线性扩展。

Conclusion: HyperComplEx框架有效解决现有嵌入方法的局限，在知识图谱嵌入方面表现出色，已发布实现和数据集促进可复现研究。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究开发多智能体AI框架处理碎片碰撞数据，重建事故前场景和推断车辆行为，在测试中表现优于人类，处理不完整数据时性能稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通碰撞重建依赖人工专业知识，分析不完整多模态数据时结果不一致，需要新方法。

Method: 提出两阶段协作框架，结合重建和推理阶段，处理多模态数据，将自然语言重建与EDR结合。

Result: 框架在39个复杂追尾碰撞案例测试中达到完美准确率，优于人类的92%，处理不完整数据时性能稳健。

Conclusion: AI在处理异构碰撞数据方面能力卓越，在重建碰撞动力学和描述事故前行为方面提供了前所未有的精度。

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划单元无法满足当地社区特定需求，缺乏实施灾害预防或响应策略的灵活性，需创建动态规划单元。

Method: 构建基于代表性初始化空间约束自组织映射（RepSC - SOM）的平台，结合自适应地理过滤和区域增长细化，AI智能体引导流程。

Result: 通过佛罗里达州杰克逊维尔市洪水相关风险案例研究，展示平台可让用户交互式探索、生成和评估区域划分。

Conclusion: 该平台结合了计算严谨性和用户驱动决策，能支持创建动态规划单元用于灾害规划。

Abstract: Conventional planning units or urban regions, such as census tracts, zip codes, or neighborhoods, often do not capture the specific demands of local communities and lack the flexibility to implement effective strategies for hazard prevention or response. To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

Conclusion: 新框架在预测神经退行性疾病病理传播方面有更好表现，能提供更多疾病机制信息。

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms generates vast amounts of unstructured product data, creating significant challenges for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.

### [16] [Faster Symmetry Breaking Constraints for Abstract Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11029)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抽象变量应用对称性破坏技术会产生大量复杂约束且实践效果差，需要更好的方法。

Method: 提出一种新的不完整方法，通过更好利用抽象结构的表示来打破对称性。

Result: 将该方法应用于处理不可区分对象产生的对称性，比2025年Akgün等人提出的方法更快。

Conclusion: 新的打破抽象结构对称性的方法比之前方法更有效。

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

TL;DR: 研究发现新颖角色分配策略“Truth Last”可提升多智能体辩论（MAD）推理性能，还提出MADC策略并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体扩展研究中，MAD角色分配策略方面的研究不足，需探索其对推理性能的影响。

Method: 发现“Truth Last”策略；提出MADC策略，结合路径一致性评估独立角色间的一致性，模拟一致性最高的角色为真相。

Result: “Truth Last”策略能将MAD在推理任务中的性能提升达22%；MADC在多种LLM模型上验证，表现出先进性能，克服了MAD性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: MADC为LLM智能体扩展的进一步改进提供了关键途径。

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，规划对于避免碰撞和在复杂密集交通场景中导航至关重要，但学习必要组件来进行最佳动作序列搜索具有挑战性。

Method: 提出DSS框架，利用可微模拟器Waymax作为下一个状态预测器和评估器，DSS代理通过对想象的未来轨迹进行梯度下降来优化动作。

Result: 实验显示，结合规划梯度和随机搜索的DSS相比序列预测、模仿学习、无模型强化学习和其他规划方法，显著提高了跟踪和路径规划精度。

Conclusion: DSS框架在自动驾驶规划中表现出色，是一种有效的规划方法。

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Conclusion: ARCTraj为研究类人推理提供结构化和可解释的基础，推动可解释性、对齐性和通用智能发展。

Abstract: We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效学习广义规划，可用于执行或剪枝规划搜索空间。

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

Conclusion: GGBench 为下一代智能系统设定了更严格的标准。

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Result: MUG在三个关键维度改进MAD协议，实现超越统计共识的事实验证、引入跨证据推理、促进主动推理。

Conclusion: MUG为大语言模型多模态推理提供更可靠有效的框架。

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

Method: 提出STaR框架，训练时采用两阶段难度感知强化学习，推理时进行轨迹级不确定性量化。

Result: 在基准测试中取得优异性能，提升了推理稳定性，在域外数据集上有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: STaR是一种可靠且受认知启发的大语言模型表格推理解决方案。

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for mission planning, perception, and decision-making, yet the lack of standardized and physically grounded benchmarks limits systematic evaluation of their reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce UAVBench, an open benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 validated UAV flight scenarios generated through taxonomy-guided LLM prompting and multi-stage safety validation. Each scenario is encoded in a structured JSON schema that includes mission objectives, vehicle configuration, environmental conditions, and quantitative risk labels, providing a unified representation of UAV operations across diverse domains. Building on this foundation, we present UAVBench_MCQ, a reasoning-oriented extension containing 50,000 multiple-choice questions spanning ten cognitive and ethical reasoning styles, ranging from aerodynamics and navigation to multi-agent coordination and integrated reasoning. This framework enables interpretable and machine-checkable assessment of UAV-specific cognition under realistic operational contexts. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-5, ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 235B, and ERNIE 4.5 300B, and find strong performance in perception and policy reasoning but persistent challenges in ethics-aware and resource-constrained decision-making. UAVBench establishes a reproducible and physically grounded foundation for benchmarking agentic AI in autonomous aerial systems and advancing next-generation UAV reasoning intelligence. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the UAVBench dataset, the UAVBench_MCQ benchmark, evaluation scripts, and all related materials on GitHub at https://github.com/maferrag/UAVBench

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

Result: 在3个闭源和2个开源模型的6个数据集上实验，EcoAlign以较低计算成本达到或超越了现有安全和效用水平。

Conclusion: EcoAlign为大视觉语言模型的鲁棒对齐提供了一种有原则、经济的途径。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.

Conclusion: 提出了一种可扩展、以人为本的方法，有效结合认知科学和机器学习用于现实世界的社交导航。

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

Abstract: We introduce KarmaTS, an interactive framework for constructing lag-indexed, executable spatiotemporal causal graphical models for multivariate time series (MTS) simulation. Motivated by the challenge of access-restricted physiological data, KarmaTS generates synthetic MTS with known causal dynamics and augments real-world datasets with expert knowledge. The system constructs a discrete-time structural causal process (DSCP) by combining expert knowledge and algorithmic proposals in a mixed-initiative, human-in-the-loop workflow. The resulting DSCP supports simulation and causal interventions, including those under user-specified distribution shifts. KarmaTS handles mixed variable types, contemporaneous and lagged edges, and modular edge functionals ranging from parameterizable templates to neural network models. Together, these features enable flexible validation and benchmarking of causal discovery algorithms through expert-informed simulation.

Conclusion: MarsRL有潜力推动多智能体推理系统发展，拓宽其在不同推理任务的应用。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有MARL方法假设的通信条件在现实中难以满足，需研究现实约束下的通信策略。

Method: 系统回顾近期现实约束下MARL的鲁棒高效通信策略进展，并聚焦三个应用分析。

Result: 梳理了相关进展，聚焦特定应用进行探讨。

Conclusion: 需采用统一方法协同设计通信、学习和鲁棒性，以弥合理论模型与实际应用差距。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数预测模型未能充分捕捉电子健康记录（EHR）多模态数据间的交互、冗余和时间模式，本文旨在解决此问题。

Method: 提出CURENet模型，利用大语言模型处理临床文本和文本化实验室测试，用Transformer编码器处理纵向顺序就诊数据。

Result: 在公共MIMIC - III和私人FEMH数据集上评估，CURENet在多标签框架下预测前10种慢性病的准确率超94%。

Conclusion: 多模态EHR集成有潜力增强临床决策并改善患者预后。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

Motivation: 现有能在推理时更新记忆的系统功能受限，灵活适应的系统需离线优化且部署后静态，要解决智能体AI系统在训练后交互中自适应问题解决方法的挑战。

Method: 提出基于大语言模型的元策略，EGuR由Guide和Consolidator两个组件构成，Guide生成候选策略，Consolidator整合反馈改进策略生成。

Conclusion: EGuR能有效根据积累经验在推理时动态生成优化策略，提升性能并降低成本。

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of engineering designs is limited by non-differentiable components in the typical computer-aided engineering (CAE) workflow, which calculates performance metrics from design parameters. While gradient-based methods could provide noticeable speed-ups in high-dimensional design spaces, codes for meshing, physical simulations, and other common components are not differentiable even if the math or physics underneath them is. We propose replacing non-differentiable pipeline components with surrogate models which are inherently differentiable. Using a toy example of aerodynamic shape optimization, we demonstrate an end-to-end differentiable pipeline where a 3D U-Net full-field surrogate replaces both meshing and simulation steps by training it on the mapping between the signed distance field (SDF) of the shape and the fields of interest. This approach enables gradient-based shape optimization without the need for differentiable solvers, which can be useful in situations where adjoint methods are unavailable and/or hard to implement.

Result: 通过两种不利事件数据集演示了ResBench的执行过程和结果解读，结果通过友好图形界面呈现给用户。

Conclusion: ResBench可用于评估数据库在面对不利事件时的恢复能力，为数据库评估提供了新的方法和工具。

Abstract: Existing database benchmarks primarily focus on performance under ideal running environments. However, in real-world scenarios, databases probably face numerous adverse events. Quantifying the ability to cope with these events from a comprehensive perspective remains an open problem. We provide the definition of database resilience to describe its performance when facing adversity and propose ResBench, a benchmark for evaluating database resilience. This framework achieves automation, standardization, and visualization of the testing process through clear hierarchical decoupling. ResBench simulates adverse events and injects them during normal transaction processing, utilizing a module to gather multiple metrics for the evaluation model. We assess database resilience across eight dimensions: throughput, latency, stability, resistance, recovery, disturbance period, adaptation capability and metric deviation. All the results are presented to users via a user-friendly graphical interface. We demonstrate the execution process and result interpretation of ResBench using two types of adversity datasets.

Result: 实验结果表明该架构从根本上重塑了拓扑结构和数据集整体动态。

Conclusion: 需要这种新的GDB - GML架构来产生更好的模型，释放基于图的数据分析的全部潜力。

Abstract: Graph Machine Learning (GML) with Graph Databases (GDBs) has gained significant relevance in recent years, due to its ability to handle complex interconnected data and apply ML techniques using Graph Data Science (GDS). However, a critical gap exists in the current way GDB-GML applications analyze data, especially in terms of Knowledge Completion (KC) in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In particular, current architectures ignore KC, working on datasets that appear incomplete or fragmented, despite they actually contain valuable hidden knowledge. This limitation may cause wrong interpretations when these data are used as input for GML models.
  This paper proposes an innovative architecture that integrates a KC phase into GDB-GML applications, demonstrating how revealing hidden knowledge can heavily impact datasets' behavior and metrics. For this purpose, we introduce scalable transitive relationships, which are links that propagate information over the network and modelled by a decay function, allowing a deterministic knowledge flows across multiple nodes.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our intuition radically reshapes both topology and overall dataset dynamics, underscoring the need for this new GDB-GML architecture to produce better models and unlock the full potential of graph-based data analysis.

Abstract: This document presents a vision for a novel AI infrastructure design that has been initially validated through inference simulations on state-of-the-art large language models. Advancements in deep learning and specialized hardware have driven the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems. However, traditional GPU-centric architectures face scalability challenges for inference workloads due to limitations in memory capacity, bandwidth, and interconnect scaling. To address these issues, the FengHuang Platform, a disaggregated AI infrastructure platform, is proposed to overcome memory and communication scaling limits for AI inference. FengHuang features a multi-tier shared-memory architecture combining high-speed local memory with centralized disaggregated remote memory, enhanced by active tensor paging and near-memory compute for tensor operations. Simulations demonstrate that FengHuang achieves up to 93% local memory capacity reduction, 50% GPU compute savings, and 16x to 70x faster inter-GPU communication compared to conventional GPU scaling. Across workloads such as GPT-3, Grok-1, and QWEN3-235B, FengHuang enables up to 50% GPU reductions while maintaining end-user performance, offering a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for AI inference infrastructure. FengHuang provides an optimal balance as a rack-level AI infrastructure scale-up solution. Its open, heterogeneous design eliminates vendor lock-in and enhances supply chain flexibility, enabling significant infrastructure and power cost reductions.

Conclusion: HPCAgentTester相比独立LLM显著提高测试编译率和正确性，为并行软件系统可靠性提供更强大、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Unit testing in High-Performance Computing (HPC) is critical but challenged by parallelism, complex algorithms, and diverse hardware. Traditional methods often fail to address non-deterministic behavior and synchronization issues in HPC applications. This paper introduces HPCAgentTester, a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to automate and enhance unit test generation for HPC software utilizing OpenMP and MPI. HPCAgentTester employs a unique collaborative workflow where specialized LLM agents (Recipe Agent and Test Agent) iteratively generate and refine test cases through a critique loop. This architecture enables the generation of context-aware unit tests that specifically target parallel execution constructs, complex communication patterns, and hierarchical parallelism. We demonstrate HPCAgentTester's ability to produce compilable and functionally correct tests for OpenMP and MPI primitives, effectively identifying subtle bugs that are often missed by conventional techniques. Our evaluation shows that HPCAgentTester significantly improves test compilation rates and correctness compared to standalone LLMs, offering a more robust and scalable solution for ensuring the reliability of parallel software systems.

Conclusion: UFO³能实现跨异构设备的准确、高效和有弹性的任务编排，将孤立代理整合为连贯、自适应的计算架构。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are transforming digital devices from passive tools into proactive intelligent collaborators. However, most existing frameworks remain confined to a single OS or device, making cross-device workflows brittle and largely manual. We present UFO$^3$, a system that unifies heterogeneous endpoints, desktops, servers, mobile devices, and edge, into a single orchestration fabric. UFO$^3$ models each user request as a mutable TaskConstellation: a distributed DAG of atomic subtasks (TaskStars) with explicit control and data dependencies (TaskStarLines). The TaskConstellation continuously evolves as results stream in from distributed devices, enabling asynchronous execution, adaptive recovery, and dynamic optimization. A Constellation Orchestrator} executes tasks safely and asynchronously while applying dynamic DAG updates, and the Agent Interaction Protocol (AIP) provides persistent, low-latency channels for reliable task dispatch and result streaming. These designs dissolve the traditional boundaries between devices and platforms, allowing agents to collaborate seamlessly and amplify their collective intelligence.
  We evaluate UFO$^3$ on NebulaBench, a benchmark of 55 cross-device tasks across 5 machines and 10 categories. UFO$^3$ achieves 83.3% subtask completion, 70.9% task success, exposes parallelism with an average width of 1.72, and reduces end-to-end latency by 31% relative to a sequential baseline. Fault-injection experiments demonstrate graceful degradation and recovery under transient and permanent agent failures. These results show that UFO$^3$ achieves accurate, efficient, and resilient task orchestration across heterogeneous devices, uniting isolated agents into a coherent, adaptive computing fabric that extends across the landscape of ubiquitous computing.

Abstract: Simulation of physical systems is essential in many scientific and engineering domains. Commonly used domain decomposition methods are unable to deliver high simulation rate or high utilization in network computing environments. In particular, Exascale systems deliver only a small fraction their peak performance for these workloads.

We apply this method and show simulations running in excess of 1.6 million time steps per second and simulations achieving 84 PFLOP/s. Our implementation can achieve 90\% of peak performance in both single-node and clustered environments. We illustrate the method by applying the shallow-water equations to model a tsunami following an asteroid impact at 460m-resolution on a planetary scale running on a cluster of 64 Cerebras CS-3 systems.

Conclusion: 有望在人工智能、算法博弈论和运筹学之间搭建合作桥梁。

Abstract: We study a Stackelberg variant of the classical Most Vital Links problem, modeled as a one-round adversarial game between an attacker and a defender. The attacker strategically removes up to $k$ edges from a flow network to maximally disrupt flow between a source $s$ and a sink $t$, after which the defender optimally reroutes the remaining flow. To capture this attacker--defender interaction, we introduce a new mathematical model of discounted cuts, in which the cost of a cut is evaluated by excluding its $k$ most expensive edges. This model generalizes the Most Vital Links problem and uncovers novel algorithmic and complexity-theoretic properties.
  We develop a unified algorithmic framework for analyzing various forms of discounted cut problems, including minimizing or maximizing the cost of a cut under discount mechanisms that exclude either the $k$ most expensive or the $k$ cheapest edges. While most variants are NP-complete on general graphs, our main result establishes polynomial-time solvability for all discounted cut problems in our framework when the input is restricted to bounded-genus graphs, a relevant class that includes many real-world networks such as transportation and infrastructure networks. With this work, we aim to open collaborative bridges between artificial intelligence, algorithmic game theory, and operations research.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider exact algorithms for Subset Balancing, a family of related problems that generalizes Subset Sum, Partition, and Equal Subset Sum. Specifically, given as input an integer vector $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ and a constant-size coefficient set $C \subset \mathbb{Z}$, we seek a nonzero solution vector $\vec{c} \in C^n$ satisfying $\vec{c} \cdot \vec{x} = 0$.
  For $C = \{-d,\ldots,d\}$, $d > 1$ and $C = \{-d,\ldots,d\}\setminus\{0\}$, $d > 2$, we present algorithms that run in time $O(|C|^{(0.5 - ε)n})$ for a constant $ε> 0$ that depends only on $C$. These are the first algorithms that break the $O(|C|^{n/2})$-time ``Meet-in-the-Middle barrier'' for these coefficient sets in the worst case. This improves on the result of Chen, Jin, Randolph and Servedio (SODA 2022), who broke the Meet-in-the-Middle barrier on these coefficient sets in the average-case setting. We also improve the best exact algorithm for Equal Subset Sum (Subset Balancing with $C = \{-1,0,1\}$), due to Mucha, Nederlof, Pawlewicz, and Węgrzycki (ESA 2019), by an exponential margin. This positively answers an open question of Jin, Williams, and Zhang (ESA 2025). Our results leave two natural cases in which we cannot yet break the Meet-in-the-Middle barrier: $C = \{-2, -1, 1, 2\}$ and $C = \{-1, 1\}$ (Partition).
  Our results bring the representation technique of Howgrave-Graham and Joux (CRYPTO 2010) from average-case to worst-case inputs for many $C$. This requires a variety of new techniques: we present strategies for (1) achieving good ``mixing'' with worst-case inputs, (2) creating flexible input representations for coefficient sets without 0, and (3) quickly recovering compatible solution pairs from sets of vectors containing ``pseudosolution pairs''. These techniques may find application to other algorithmic problems on integer sums or be of independent interest.

Motivation: 已知有限域上一元多项式因式分解最快算法的3/2指数可能是采用特定策略的固有障碍，期望克服该障碍。

Method: 提出新策略并引出一个数论猜想，通过分析数论猜想中参数α和β的取值来改进算法指数。

Result: 若α, β < 1/2可改进一元多项式因式分解的指数；α = β = 1/3时可得到指数为4/3的算法，还能将整数因式分解确定性算法的当前最佳指数从1/5降至1/6。

Conclusion: 新策略有潜力克服3/2指数障碍，数论猜想的不同参数取值对多项式和整数因式分解算法有积极影响。

Abstract: The fastest known algorithm for factoring a degree $n$ univariate polynomial over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ runs in time $O(n^{3/2 + o(1)}\text{polylog } q)$, and there is a reason to believe that the $3/2$ exponent represents a ''barrier'' inherent in algorithms that employ a so-called baby-steps-giant-steps strategy. In this paper, we propose a new strategy with the potential to overcome the $3/2$ barrier. In doing so we are led to a number-theoretic conjecture, one form of which is that there are sets $S, T$ of cardinality $n^β$, consisting of positive integers of magnitude at most $\exp(n^α)$, such that every integer $i \in [n]$ divides $s-t$ for some $s \in S, t \in T$. Achieving $α+ β\le 1 + o(1)$ is trivial; we show that achieving $α, β< 1/2$ (together with an assumption that $S, T$ are structured) implies an improvement to the exponent 3/2 for univariate polynomial factorization. Achieving $α= β= 1/3$ is best-possible and would imply an exponent 4/3 algorithm for univariate polynomial factorization. Interestingly, a second consequence would be a reduction of the current-best exponent for deterministic (exponential) algorithms for factoring integers, from $1/5$ to $1/6$.

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing cycle bases of graphs with low maximum edge participation, defined as the maximum number of basis cycles that share any single edge. This quantity, though less studied than total weight or length, plays a critical role in quantum fault tolerance because it directly impacts the overhead of lattice surgery procedures used to implement an almost universal quantum gate set. Building on a recursive algorithm of Freedman and Hastings, we introduce a family of load-aware heuristics that adaptively select vertices and edges to minimize edge participation throughout the cycle basis construction. Our approach improves empirical performance on random regular graphs and on graphs derived from small quantum codes. We further analyze a simplified balls-into-bins process to establish lower bounds on edge participation. While the model differs from the cycle basis algorithm on real graphs, it captures what can be proven for our heuristics without using complex graph theoretic properties related to the distribution of cycles in the graph. Our analysis suggests that the maximum load of our heuristics grows on the order of (log n)^2. Our results indicate that careful cycle basis construction can yield significant practical benefits in the design of fault-tolerant quantum systems. This question also carries theoretical interest, as it is essentially identical to the basis number of a graph, defined as the minimum possible maximum edge participation over all cycle bases.

Abstract: Nishimoto and Tabei [CPM, 2021] proposed r-enum, an algorithm to enumerate various characteristic substrings, including maximal repeats, in a string $T$ of length $n$ in $O(r)$ words of compressed working space, where $r \le n$ is the number of runs in the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) of $T$. Given the run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT) of $T$, r-enum runs in $O(n\log\log_{w}(n/r))$ time in addition to the time linear to the number of output strings, where $w=Θ(\log n)$ is the word size. In this paper, we improve the $O(n\log\log_{w}(n/r))$ term to $O(n)$. We also extend r-enum to compute other context-sensitive repeats such as near-supermaximal repeats (NSMRs) and supermaximal repeats, and the context diversity for every maximal repeat in the same complexities. Furthermore, we study the occurrences that witness NSMRs, which have recently attracted attention under the name of net occurrences: An occurrence of a repeat is called a net occurrence if it is not covered by another repeat, and the net frequency of a repeat is the number of its net occurrences. With this terminology, an NSMR is defined to be a repeat with a positive net frequency. Given the RLBWT of $T$, we show how to compute the set $S^{nsmr}$ of all NSMRs in $T$ together with their net frequency/occurrences in $O(n)$ time and $O(r)$ space. We also show that an $O(r)$-space data structure can be built from the RLBWT to support queries of computing the net frequency of any query pattern $P$ in $O(|P|)$ time. The data structure is built in $O(r)$ space and in $O(n)$ time with high probability or deterministic $O(n+|S^{nsmr}|\log\log\min(σ,|S^{nsmr}|))$ time, where $σ\le r$ is the alphabet size of $T$. To achieve this, we prove that the total number of net occurrences is less than $2r$. We also get a new upper bound $2r$ of the number of minimal unique substrings in $T$, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing an ordered norm of a load vector (indexed by a set of $d$ resources), where a finite number $n$ of customers $c$ contribute to the load of each resource by choosing a solution $x_c$ in a convex set $X_c \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d_{\geq 0}$; so we minimize $||\sum_{c}x_c||$ for some fixed ordered norm $||\cdot||$. We devise a randomized algorithm that computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution to this problem and makes, with high probability, $\mathcal{O}((n+d) (\varepsilon^{-2}+\log\log d)\log (n+d))$ calls to oracles that minimize linear functions (with non-negative coefficients) over $X_c$. While this has been known for the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm via the multiplicative weights update method, existing proof techniques do not extend to arbitrary ordered norms. Our algorithm uses a resource price mechanism that is motivated by the follow-the-regularized-leader paradigm, and is expressed by smooth approximations of ordered norms. We need and show that these have non-trivial stability properties, which may be of independent interest. For each customer, we define dynamic cost budgets, which evolve throughout the algorithm, to determine the allowed step sizes. This leads to non-uniform updates and may even reject certain oracle solutions. Using non-uniform sampling together with a martingale argument, we can guarantee sufficient expected progress in each iteration, and thus bound the total number of oracle calls with high probability.

Abstract: Rank aggregation is a task of combining the rankings of items from multiple users into a single ranking that best represents the users' rankings. Alabi et al. (AAAI'22) presents differentially-private (DP) polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTASes) and $5$-approximation algorithms with certain additive errors for the Kemeny rank aggregation problem in both central and local models. In this paper, we present improved DP PTASes with smaller additive error in the central model. Furthermore, we are first to study the footrule rank aggregation problem under DP. We give a near-optimal algorithm for this problem; as a corollary, this leads to 2-approximation algorithms with the same additive error as the $5$-approximation algorithms of Alabi et al. for the Kemeny rank aggregation problem in both central and local models.

Abstract: We consider the problems of \emph{learning} and \emph{testing} real-valued convex functions over Gaussian space. Despite the extensive study of function convexity across mathematics, statistics, and computer science, its learnability and testability have largely been examined only in discrete or restricted settings -- typically with respect to the Hamming distance, which is ill-suited for real-valued functions.
  In contrast, we study these problems in high dimensions under the standard Gaussian measure, assuming sample access to the function and a mild smoothness condition, namely Lipschitzness. A smoothness assumption is natural and, in fact, necessary even in one dimension: without it, convexity cannot be inferred from finitely many samples. As our main results, we give:
  - Learning Convex Functions: An agnostic proper learning algorithm for Lipschitz convex functions that achieves error $\varepsilon$ using $n^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ samples, together with a complementary lower bound of $n^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$ samples in the \emph{correlational statistical query (CSQ)} model.
  - Testing Convex Functions: A tolerant (two-sided) tester for convexity of Lipschitz functions with the same sample complexity (as a corollary of our learning result), and a one-sided tester (which never rejects convex functions) using $O(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)^n$ samples.

Abstract: We design new algorithms for approximating 2CSPs on graphs with bounded threshold rank, that is, whose normalized adjacency matrix has few eigenvalues larger than $\varepsilon$, smaller than $-\varepsilon$, or both. Unlike on worst-case graphs, 2CSPs on bounded threshold rank graphs can be $(1+O(\varepsilon))$-approximated efficiently. Prior approximation algorithms for this problem run in time exponential in the threshold rank and $1/\varepsilon$. Our algorithm has running time which is polynomial in $1/\varepsilon$ and exponential in the threshold rank of the label-extended graph, and near-linear in the input size. As a consequence, we obtain the first $(1+O(\varepsilon))$ approximation for MAX-CUT on bounded threshold rank graphs running in $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ time. We also improve the state-of-the-art running time for 2CSPs on bounded threshold-rank graphs from polynomial in input size to near-linear via a new comparison inequality between the threshold rank of the label-extended graph and base graph. Our algorithm is a simple yet novel combination of subspace enumeration and semidefinite programming.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study sequential price competition among $N$ sellers, each influenced by the pricing decisions of their rivals. Specifically, the demand function for each seller $i$ follows the single index model $λ_i(\mathbf{p}) = μ_i(\langle \boldsymbolθ_{i,0}, \mathbf{p} \rangle)$, with known increasing link $μ_i$ and unknown parameter $\boldsymbolθ_{i,0}$, where the vector $\mathbf{p}$ denotes the vector of prices offered by all the sellers simultaneously at a given instant. Each seller observes only their own realized demand -- unobservable to competitors -- and the prices set by rivals. Our framework generalizes existing approaches that focus solely on linear demand models. We propose a novel decentralized policy, PML-GLUCB, that combines penalized MLE with an upper-confidence pricing rule, removing the need for coordinated exploration phases across sellers -- which is integral to previous linear models -- and accommodating both binary and real-valued demand observations. Relative to a dynamic benchmark policy, each seller achieves $O(N^{2}\sqrt{T}\log(T))$ regret, which essentially matches the optimal rate known in the linear setting. A significant technical contribution of our work is the development of a variant of the elliptical potential lemma -- typically applied in single-agent systems -- adapted to our competitive multi-agent environment.

Conclusion: 改进了相关界值，解决了开放问题。

Abstract: Communication networks are essential for our economy and our everyday lives. This makes them lucrative targets for attacks. Today, we see an ongoing battle between criminals that try to disrupt our key communication networks and security professionals that try to mitigate these attacks. However, today's networks, like the Internet or peer-to-peer networks among smart devices, are not controlled by a single authority, but instead consist of many independently administrated entities that are interconnected. Thus, both the decisions of how to interconnect and how to secure against potential attacks are taken in a decentralized way by selfish agents.
  This strategic setting, with agents that want to interconnect and potential attackers that want to disrupt the network, was captured via an influential game-theoretic model by Goyal, Jabbari, Kearns, Khanna, and Morgenstern (WINE 2016). We revisit this model and show improved tight bounds on the achieved robustness of networks created by selfish agents. As our main result, we show that such networks can resist attacks of a large class of potential attackers, i.e., these networks maintain asymptotically optimal welfare post attack. This improves several bounds and resolves an open problem. Along the way, we show the counter-intuitive result, that attackers that aim at minimizing the social welfare post attack do not actually inflict the greatest possible damage.

Abstract: As electricity consumption grows, reducing peak demand--the maximum load on the grid--has become critical for preventing infrastructure strain and blackouts. Pricing mechanisms that incentivize consumers with flexible loads to shift consumption away from high-demand periods have emerged as effective tools, yet different mechanisms are used in practice with unclear relative performance. This work compares two widely implemented approaches: anytime peak pricing (AP), where consumers pay for their individual maximum consumption, and coincident peak pricing (CP), where consumers pay for their consumption during the system-wide peak period. To compare these mechanisms, we model the electricity market as a strategic game and characterize the peak demand in equilibrium under both AP and CP. Our main result demonstrates that with perfect information, equilibrium peak demand under CP never exceeds that under AP; on the other hand, with imperfect information, the coordination introduced by CP can backfire and induce larger equilibrium peaks than AP. These findings demonstrate that potential gains from coupling users' costs (as done in CP) must be weighed against these miscoordination risks. We conclude with preliminary results indicating that progressive demand cost structures--rather than per-unit charges--may mitigate these risks while preserving coordination benefits, achieving desirable performance in both deterministic and stochastic settings.

Result: 提出了EVS机制。

Conclusion: EVS机制能最大化有贡献玩家的平等福利。

Abstract: Incentives for early arrival (I4EA) was recently proposed for studying online cooperative games. In an online cooperative game, players arrive in an unknown order, and the value increase after each player arrived should be distributed immediately among all the arrived players. Although there is only one arriving order in the game, we also hope that the value distribution is equal to their Shapley value in expectation. To achieve these goals, the early solutions ignored the fairness in each single arriving order. More specifically, an important player may receive nothing in a game, which seems unfair in reality. To combat this, we propose refined fairness in this paper and design new solutions in 0-1 value games. Specifically, we compute the distance of the distribution in each order to the Shapley value and aim to minimize it. We propose a new mechanism called Egalitarian Value-Sharing (EVS) to do so. We also show that the mechanism can maximize the egalitarian welfare among all the players who made contributions.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for ε-optimally solving two-player zero-sum partially observable stochastic games (zs-POSGs). These games pose a major challenge due to the absence of a principled connection with dynamic programming (DP) techniques developed for two-player zero-sum stochastic games (zs-SGs). Prior attempts at transferring solution methods have lacked a lossless reduction, defined here as a transformation that preserves value functions, equilibrium strategies, and optimality structure, thereby limiting generalisation to ad-hoc algorithms. This work introduces the first lossless reduction from zs-POSGs to transition-independent zs-SGs, enabling the principled application of a broad class of DP-based methods. We show empirically that point-based value iteration (PBVI) algorithms, applied via this reduction, produce ε-optimal strategies across a range of benchmark domains, consistently matching or outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Our results open a systematic pathway for algorithmic and theoretical transfer from SGs to partially observable settings.

Abstract: We study strategic candidate nomination by parties in elections decided by Plurality voting. Each party selects a nominee before the election, and the winner is chosen from the nominated candidates based on the voters' preferences. We introduce a new restriction on these preferences, which we call party-aligned single-peakedness: all voters agree on a common ordering of the parties along an ideological axis, but may differ in their perceptions of the positions of individual candidates within each party. The preferences of each voter are single-peaked with respect to their own axis over the candidates, which is consistent with the global ordering of the parties. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a preference profile satisfies party-aligned single-peakedness. In this domain, we give polynomial-time algorithms for deciding whether a given party can become the winner under some (or all) nominations, and whether this can occur in some pure Nash equilibrium. We also prove a tight result about the guaranteed existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria for elections with up to three parties for single-peaked and party-aligned single-peaked preference profiles.

Abstract: We study the recently introduced fair division concept of the happy nucleolus for cost allocation among players in a cooperative game, with special focus on its computation. The happy nucleolus applies the same fairness criterion as the well-established nucleolus but with reduced total value. Still, we show that the relation between the two concepts is quite involved, and intuitive properties do not hold - e.g., the entry of a player in the happy nucleolus can be larger than the entry of the same player in the nucleolus, even for monotone and subadditive games. This refutes conjectures of Meir, Rosenschein and Malizia (2011).
  Further, we study the separation problem of the linear programs appearing in the MPS scheme for computing the (happy) nucleolus. It includes linear subspace avoidance constraints, which can be handled efficiently for problems with a certain dynamic programming formulation due to Köhnemann and Toth (2020). We show how to get rid of these constraints for all monotone games if we allow for an arbitrarily small error of epsilon, thus conserving known approximation guarantees for the same problem without subspace avoidance.
  Finally, we focus on practical results at the example of vehicle routing games by designing an efficient heuristic based on our previous insights and past work, and demonstrate its power.

Abstract: In a public goods game, every player chooses whether or not to buy a good that all neighboring players will have access to. We consider a setting in which the good is indivisible, neighboring players are out-neighbors in a directed graph, and there is a capacity constraint on their number, k, that can benefit from the good. This means that each player makes a two-pronged decision: decide whether or not to buy and, conditional on buying, choose which k out-neighbors to share access. We examine both pure and mixed Nash equilibria in the model from the perspective of existence, computation, and efficiency. We perform a comprehensive study for these three dimensions with respect to both sharing capacity (k) and the network structure (the underlying directed graph), and establish sharp complexity dichotomies for each.

Abstract: Computing stable partitions in hedonic games is a challenging task because there exist games in which stable outcomes do not exist. Even more, these No-instances can often be leveraged to prove computational hardness results. We make this impression rigorous in a dynamic model of cardinal hedonic games by providing meta theorems. These imply hardness of deciding about the possible or necessary convergence of deviation dynamics based on the mere existence of No-instances. Our results hold for additively separable, fractional, and modified fractional hedonic games (ASHGs, FHGs, and MFHGs). Moreover, they encompass essentially all reasonable stability notions based on single-agent deviations. In addition, we propose dynamics as a method to find individually rational and contractually individual stable (CIS) partitions in ASHGs. In particular, we find that CIS dynamics from the singleton partition possibly converge after a linear number of deviations but may require an exponential number of deviations in the worst case.

Abstract: We address the synthesis of control policies for unknown discrete-time stochastic dynamical systems to satisfy temporal logic objectives. We present a data-driven, abstraction-based control framework that integrates online learning with novel incremental game-solving. Under appropriate continuity assumptions, our method abstracts the system dynamics into a finite stochastic (2.5-player) game graph derived from data. Given a requirement over time on this graph, we compute the winning region -- i.e., the set of initial states from which the objective is satisfiable -- in the resulting game, together with a corresponding control policy.
  Our main contribution is the construction of abstractions, winning regions and control policies incrementally, as data about the system dynamics accumulates. Concretely, our algorithm refines under- and over-approximations of reachable sets for each state-action pair as new data samples arrive. These refinements induce structural modifications in the game graph abstraction -- such as the addition or removal of nodes and edges -- which in turn modify the winning region. Crucially, we show that these updates are inherently monotonic: under-approximations can only grow, over-approximations can only shrink, and the winning region can only expand.
  We exploit this monotonicity by defining an objective-induced ranking function on the nodes of the abstract game that increases monotonically as new data samples are incorporated. These ranks underpin our novel incremental game-solving algorithm, which employs customized gadgets (DAG-like subgames) within a rank-lifting algorithm to efficiently update the winning region. Numerical case studies demonstrate significant computational savings compared to the baseline approach, which resolves the entire game from scratch whenever new data samples arrive.

Abstract: Traditional ID-based recommender systems often struggle with cold-start and generalization challenges. Multimodal recommendation systems, which leverage textual and visual data, offer a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, existing industrial approaches typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm: first pretraining a multimodal model, then applying its frozen representations to train the recommendation model. This decoupled framework suffers from misalignment between multimodal learning and recommendation objectives, as well as an inability to adapt dynamically to new data. To address these limitations, we propose LEMUR, the first large-scale multimodal recommender system trained end-to-end from raw data. By jointly optimizing both the multimodal and recommendation components, LEMUR ensures tighter alignment with downstream objectives while enabling real-time parameter updates. Constructing multimodal sequential representations from user history often entails prohibitively high computational costs. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose a novel memory bank mechanism that incrementally accumulates historical multimodal representations throughout the training process. After one month of deployment in Douyin Search, LEMUR has led to a 0.843% reduction in query change rate decay and a 0.81% improvement in QAUC. Additionally, LEMUR has shown significant gains across key offline metrics for Douyin Advertisement. Our results validate the superiority of end-to-end multimodal recommendation in real-world industrial scenarios.

Motivation: 现有网络存档在PDF访问和可发现性上存在挑战，当前浏览方式有限。

Method: 构建GovScape系统，支持基于元数据过滤、精确文本搜索、语义文本搜索和视觉搜索四种搜索形式。

Result: GovScape能对1000多万份PDF进行多模态搜索，预处理成本约1500美元，约每美元处理47000页。

Conclusion: GovScape有立即扩展的潜力，已开始探索处理超1亿份PDF的多模态搜索。

Abstract: Efforts over the past three decades have produced web archives containing billions of webpage snapshots and petabytes of data. The End of Term Web Archive alone contains, among other file types, millions of PDFs produced by the federal government. While preservation with web archives has been successful, significant challenges for access and discoverability remain. For example, current affordances for browsing the End of Term PDFs are limited to downloading and browsing individual PDFs, as well as performing basic keyword search across them. In this paper, we introduce GovScape, a public search system that supports multimodal searches across 10,015,993 federal government PDFs from the 2020 End of Term crawl (70,958,487 total PDF pages) - to our knowledge, all renderable PDFs in the 2020 crawl that are 50 pages or under. GovScape supports four primary forms of search over these 10 million PDFs: in addition to providing (1) filter conditions over metadata facets including domain and crawl date and (2) exact text search against the PDF text, we provide (3) semantic text search and (4) visual search against the PDFs across individual pages, enabling users to structure queries such as "redacted documents" or "pie charts." We detail the constituent components of GovScape, including the search affordances, embedding pipeline, system architecture, and open source codebase. Significantly, the total estimated compute cost for GovScape's pre-processing pipeline for 10 million PDFs was approximately $1,500, equivalent to 47,000 PDF pages per dollar spent on compute, demonstrating the potential for immediate scalability. Accordingly, we outline steps that we have already begun pursuing toward multimodal search at the 100+ million PDF scale. GovScape can be found at https://www.govscape.net.

Result: 在Goodbooks、Movielens和Synthetic数据集上，小用户群体召回率优于基线方法，各群体规模结果相当，恢复的矩阵秩更低。

Conclusion: Group Soft - Impute SVD系统在处理稀疏高维数据的群体推荐任务中有效。

Abstract: The growing popularity of group activities increased the need to develop methods for providing recommendations to a group of users based on the collective preferences of the group members. Several group recommender systems have been proposed, but these methods often struggle due to sparsity and high-dimensionality of the available data, common in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a group recommender system called Group Soft-Impute SVD, which leverages soft-impute singular value decomposition to enhance group recommendations. This approach addresses the challenge of sparse high-dimensional data using low-rank matrix completion. We compared the performance of Group Soft-Impute SVD with Group MF based approaches and found that our method outperforms the baselines in recall for small user groups while achieving comparable results across all group sizes when tasked on Goodbooks, Movielens, and Synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our method recovers lower matrix ranks than the baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in leveraging structured world knowledge and multi-step reasoning capabilities. However, fundamental challenges arise when transforming LLMs into real-world recommender systems due to semantic and behavioral misalignment. To bridge this gap, we propose Align$^3$GR, a novel framework that unifies token-level, behavior modeling-level, and preference-level alignment. Our approach introduces: Dual tokenization fusing user-item semantic and collaborative signals. Enhanced behavior modeling with bidirectional semantic alignment. Progressive DPO strategy combining self-play (SP-DPO) and real-world feedback (RF-DPO) for dynamic preference adaptation. Experiments show Align$^3$GR outperforms the SOTA baseline by +17.8% in Recall@10 and +20.2% in NDCG@10 on the public dataset, with significant gains in online A/B tests and full-scale deployment on an industrial large-scale recommendation platform.

Conclusion: MOON实践积累的经验对研究社区有价值，明确关键中间指标，研究的缩放定律有助于电商领域多模态表征学习。

Abstract: We introduce MOON, our comprehensive set of sustainable iterative practices for multimodal representation learning for e-commerce applications. MOON has already been fully deployed across all stages of Taobao search advertising system, including retrieval, relevance, ranking, and so on. The performance gains are particularly significant on click-through rate (CTR) prediction task, which achieves an overall +20.00% online CTR improvement. Over the past three years, this project has delivered the largest improvement on CTR prediction task and undergone five full-scale iterations. Throughout the exploration and iteration of our MOON, we have accumulated valuable insights and practical experience that we believe will benefit the research community. MOON contains a three-stage training paradigm of "Pretraining, Post-training, and Application", allowing effective integration of multimodal representations with downstream tasks. Notably, to bridge the misalignment between the objectives of multimodal representation learning and downstream training, we define the exchange rate to quantify how effectively improvements in an intermediate metric can translate into downstream gains. Through this analysis, we identify the image-based search recall as a critical intermediate metric guiding the optimization of multimodal models. Over three years and five iterations, MOON has evolved along four critical dimensions: data processing, training strategy, model architecture, and downstream application. The lessons and insights gained through the iterative improvements will also be shared. As part of our exploration into scaling effects in the e-commerce field, we further conduct a systematic study of the scaling laws governing multimodal representation learning, examining multiple factors such as the number of training tokens, negative samples, and the length of user behavior sequences.

Conclusion: 集明智视角对实现顺序推荐任务的先进性能至关重要。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are emerging as a promising paradigm for simulating user behavior to enhance recommender systems. However, their effectiveness is often limited by existing studies that focus on modeling user ratings for individual items. This point-wise approach leads to prevalent issues such as inaccurate user preference comprehension and rigid item-semantic representations.
  To address these limitations, we propose the novel Set-wise Reflective Learning Framework (SRLF). Our framework operationalizes a closed-loop "assess-validate-reflect" cycle that harnesses the powerful in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. SRLF departs from conventional point-wise assessment by formulating a holistic judgment on an entire set of items. It accomplishes this by comprehensively analyzing both the intricate interrelationships among items within the set and their collective alignment with the user's preference profile. This method of set-level contextual understanding allows our model to capture complex relational patterns essential to user behavior, making it significantly more adept for sequential recommendation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, confirming that this set-wise perspective is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance in sequential recommendation tasks.

Abstract: Real-time energy forecasting on edge devices represents a major challenge for smart grid optimization and intelligent buildings. We present LAD-BNet (Lag-Aware Dual-Branch Network), an innovative neural architecture optimized for edge inference with Google Coral TPU. Our hybrid approach combines a branch dedicated to explicit exploitation of temporal lags with a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) featuring dilated convolutions, enabling simultaneous capture of short and long-term dependencies. Tested on real energy consumption data with 10-minute temporal resolution, LAD-BNet achieves 14.49% MAPE at 1-hour horizon with only 18ms inference time on Edge TPU, representing an 8-12 x acceleration compared to CPU. The multi-scale architecture enables predictions up to 12 hours with controlled performance degradation. Our model demonstrates a 2.39% improvement over LSTM baselines and 3.04% over pure TCN architectures, while maintaining a 180MB memory footprint suitable for embedded device constraints. These results pave the way for industrial applications in real-time energy optimization, demand management, and operational planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法在提升尾类性能时会降低头类精度，且头尾比例这一影响权衡的关键因素被忽视。

Method: 通过在CIFAR100上控制不平衡率和头尾比例进行实验，提出两阶段的LT - Soups框架，第一阶段对平衡子集微调的模型平均以减少头类偏差，第二阶段在全数据集上仅微调分类器恢复头类精度。

Result: 在六个基准数据集的实验显示，LT - Soups在多种不平衡情况下比PEFT和传统模型汤有更优的权衡。

Conclusion: LT - Soups框架能有效解决PEFT方法的局限性，在不同长尾分布场景中实现更好的效果。

Abstract: Real-world datasets typically exhibit long-tailed (LT) distributions, where a few head classes dominate and many tail classes are severely underrepresented. While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($ρ$) and head-tail ratio ($η$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of governing equations from data remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.

Method: 提出Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT)方法，通过截断训练数据优化初始推理前缀生成、干预早期推理阶段防止误差累积、约束干预向量大小避免干扰数值编码。

Result: 在多种模型架构上的大量实验表明，BREP在数学推理任务上优于标准ReFT和基于权重的PEFT方法。

Conclusion: BREP具有优越的有效性、效率和强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient finetuning (PEFT) enhances model performance on downstream tasks by updating a minimal subset of parameters. Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: While generative models have become increasingly prevalent across various domains, fundamental concerns regarding their reliability persist. A crucial yet understudied aspect of these models is the uncertainty quantification surrounding their distribution approximation capabilities. Current evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on measuring the closeness between the learned and the target distributions, neglecting the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. In this position paper, we formalize the problem of uncertainty quantification in generative model learning. We discuss potential research directions, including the use of ensemble-based precision-recall curves. Our preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregated precision-recall curves in capturing model approximation uncertainty, enabling systematic comparison among different model architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics.

Conclusion: EarthSight能在严格的下行带宽和星载电源预算内实现可扩展、低延迟的卫星图像分析。

Abstract: Low-latency delivery of satellite imagery is essential for time-critical applications such as disaster response, intelligence, and infrastructure monitoring. However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

Abstract: The functional independence measure (FIM) is widely used to evaluate patients' physical independence in activities of daily living. However, traditional FIM assessment imposes a significant burden on both patients and healthcare professionals. To address this challenge, we propose an automated FIM score estimation method that utilizes simple exercises different from the designated FIM assessment actions. Our approach employs a deep neural network architecture integrating a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism to estimate FIM motor item scores. The model effectively captures long-term temporal dependencies and identifies key body-joint contributions through learned attention weights. We evaluated our method in a study of 277 rehabilitation patients, focusing on FIM transfer and locomotion items. Our approach successfully distinguishes between completely independent patients and those requiring assistance, achieving balanced accuracies of 70.09-78.79 % across different FIM items. Additionally, our analysis reveals specific movement patterns that serve as reliable predictors for particular FIM evaluation items.

Abstract: We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.

Our experiments show significant differences in model robustness based on the nature and severity of the data degradation. Moreover, the proposed methodology and accompanying tools offer practical support for practitioners seeking to enhance data pipeline robustness, and provide researchers with a flexible framework for further experimentation in data-centric AI contexts.

Conclusion: 适应性对不确定下的高效边缘推理至关重要。

Abstract: Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret.

Motivation: 计算完整NTK矩阵不可行，尤其是循环架构，需更高效的分析方法。

Result: 能快速计算NTK的迹、Frobenius范数、有效秩和对齐，单边估计器在低样本情况表现更好，无矩阵随机方法有数量级的加速。

Conclusion: 无矩阵随机方法可大幅加速NTK的分析和应用。

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes how a model's state evolves over Gradient Descent. Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large. In total, our results demonstrate that matrix-free randomized approaches can yield speedups of many orders of magnitude, leading to faster analysis and applications of the NTK.

TL;DR: 本文针对线性预测聚类（LPC）问题，在约束优化范式下提出两种新方法，提高了全局优化效率，经实验验证效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有贪婪优化方法用于LPC缺乏全局最优性，MIP方法虽有全局最优性但可扩展性差，因此需要改进全局优化效率。

Method: 利用可分性的关键理论性质推导有可证明误差界的近似解，降低MIP复杂度；将LPC近似为二次伪布尔优化（QPBO）问题。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，新方法能持续得到接近最优的解，回归误差低于贪婪优化，可扩展性优于现有MIP公式。

Conclusion: 提出的两种新方法有效提高了LPC全局优化的效率。

Abstract: Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC) partitions samples based on shared linear relationships between feature and target variables, with numerous applications including marketing, medicine, and education. Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.

Result: ourmodel优于现有的统计和机器学习基线。

Conclusion: ourmodel能实现准确的运行时间预测，支持Dragonfly网络的高效混合仿真。

Abstract: The Dragonfly network, with its high-radix and low-diameter structure, is a leading interconnect in high-performance computing. A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.

Motivation: 流行的一阶差分隐私机器学习算法计算和内存成本高，现有零阶方法效用低且应用领域有限。

Method: 利用公共信息指导和改进私有零阶算法的梯度近似，提出PAZO框架并进行理论分析。

Result: PAZO在预训练和微调设置中的视觉和文本任务上实现了更好的隐私/效用权衡，在高隐私制度下优于最佳一阶基线，运行速度最高提升16倍。

Conclusion: PAZO是一种有效的解决一阶差分隐私机器学习算法高成本问题的方法。

Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks for deploying popular first-order differentially private (DP) machine learning algorithms (e.g., DP-SGD) lies in their high computation and memory cost, despite the existence of optimized implementations. Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\times$ runtime speedup.

Motivation: 研究Transformer对复杂算术函数（长Collatz步骤）的预测能力及学习模式，以更好理解、解释和改进语言模型。

Method: 使用Transformer模型对长Collatz步骤进行预测，分析不同编码基数下模型的准确率和学习模式，研究失败案例。

Result: 模型准确率因编码基数而异，各模型有共同学习模式，失败案例有可预测规律，幻觉现象几乎不发生，多数失败是因错误估计循环长度。

Conclusion: 学习复杂算术函数的难点在于计算的控制结构，用数学问题研究语言模型的方法可应用于广泛问题。

Abstract: We investigate transformer prediction of long Collatz steps, a complex arithmetic function that maps odd integers to their distant successors in the Collatz sequence ( $u_{n+1}=u_n/2$ if $u_n$ is even, $u_{n+1}=(3u_n+1)/2$ if $u_n$ is odd). Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops. We believe that the approach outlined here, using mathematical problems as tools for understanding, explaining, and perhaps improving language models, can be applied to a broad range of problems and bear fruitful results.

Motivation: 半去中心化联邦学习中S2S和S2A策略缺乏严格理论和实证比较。

Method: 在统一收敛框架下分析S2S和S2A，考虑采样率、服务器聚合频率和网络连接性等关键系统参数。

Result: 分析和实验结果显示，根据设备间数据异质性程度，两种策略在不同情况下表现不同。

Conclusion: 为实际半去中心化联邦学习部署提供具体设计指南。

Abstract: In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.

Abstract: Although neural operators are widely used in data-driven physical simulations, their training remains computationally expensive. Recent advances address this issue via downstream learning, where a model pretrained on simpler problems is fine-tuned on more complex ones. In this research, we investigate transformer-based neural operators, which have previously been applied only to specific problems, in a more general transfer learning setting. We evaluate their performance across diverse PDE problems, including extrapolation to unseen parameters, incorporation of new variables, and transfer from multi-equation datasets. Our results demonstrate that advanced neural operator architectures can effectively transfer knowledge across PDE problems.

Abstract: Natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and winter storms have induced large-scale power outages in the U.S., resulting in tremendous economic and societal impacts. Accurately predicting power outage recovery and impact is key to resilience of power grid. Recent advances in machine learning offer viable frameworks for estimating power outage duration from geospatial and weather data. However, three major challenges are inherent to the task in a real world setting: spatial dependency of the data, spatial heterogeneity of the impact, and moderate event data. We propose a novel approach to estimate the duration of severe weather-induced power outages through Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Our network uses a simple structure from unsupervised pre-training, followed by semi-supervised learning. We use field data from four major hurricanes affecting $501$ counties in eight Southeastern U.S. states. The model exhibits an excellent performance ($>93\%$ accuracy) and outperforms the existing methods XGBoost, Random Forest, GCN and simple GAT by $2\% - 15\%$ in both the overall performance and class-wise accuracy.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their practical advantage on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ansätze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.

Conclusion: SurfaceBench建立了具有挑战性和诊断性的测试平台。

Abstract: Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.

Abstract: Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series remains a fundamental challenge. Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures. These results highlight the importance of modeling not only the dynamics along the path but also the geometry of the path itself, offering a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.

Abstract: Consider the problem of finding the best matching in a weighted graph where we only have access to predictions of the actual stochastic weights, based on an underlying context. If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.
  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\mathcal C$ and any predictor $γ$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\hat γ$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\hat γ$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $γ$. We complement this result by providing sample complexity bounds.

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.

Result: 在四个流行代码数据集上，ExPairT - LLM 的 pass@1 平均比现有算法高 13.0%，最高高 27.1%，还使执行复杂推理的 LLMs 的 pass@1 提高 24.0%。

Conclusion: ExPairT - LLM 算法在代码选择任务上具有优势，能有效应对现有算法的不足。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.

Abstract: The integration of graphs with Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) has recently gained attention, as intermediate goals (subgoals) can be effectively sampled from graphs that naturally represent the overall task structure in most RL tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration. Empirical results indicate that leveraging high and low-level intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with an extra small computational cost in dense and sparse reward environments.

Abstract: Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.

Abstract: Federated clustering addresses the critical challenge of extracting patterns from decentralized, unlabeled data. However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving clustering accuracy by up to 10\% (NMI) over federated baselines while maintaining provable privacy guarantees.

Result: GraphToxin能恢复删除信息，现有防御机制大多无效甚至会加剧攻击效果。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发更有效、强大的针对GraphToxin的防御策略。

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with "the right to be forgotten" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.

Abstract: Diffusion model (DM)-based channel estimation, which generates channel samples via a posteriori sampling stepwise with denoising process, has shown potential in high-precision channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, slow sampling speed is an essential challenge for recent developed DM-based schemes. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel flow matching (FM)-based generative model for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation. We first formulate the channel estimation problem within FM framework, where the conditional probability path is constructed from the noisy channel distribution to the true channel distribution. In this case, the path evolves along the straight-line trajectory at a constant speed. Then, guided by this, we derive the velocity field that depends solely on the noise statistics to guide generative models training. Furthermore, during the sampling phase, we utilize the trained velocity field as prior information for channel estimation, which allows for quick and reliable noise channel enhancement via ordinary differential equation (ODE) Euler solver. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FM-based channel estimation scheme can significantly reduce the sampling overhead compared to other popular DM-based schemes, such as the score matching (SM)-based scheme. Meanwhile, it achieves superior channel estimation accuracy under different channel conditions.

Abstract: Model merging combines expert models for multitask performance but faces challenges from parameter interference. This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks. Experimental results show our method generates a superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上实验表明，DART在保持域适应性的同时有效增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 成功建立URDA范式和理论，DART算法简单有效，验证了相关理论。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing domain shifts. Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.

Conclusion: 为NCMP框架奠定基础，是提升经典GNN图表示能力的实用途径。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an indispensable tool for analyzing relational data. In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture. Overall, the paper lays the foundation for the novel NCMP framework as a practical path toward further enhancing the graph representational power of classical GNNs.

Conclusion: Echoless - LP能有效解决基于标签预计算HGNN的训练标签泄漏问题，有更好性能和内存效率。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are widely used for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination(ZSC) has become a hot topic in reinforcement learning research recently. It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity. To empirically validate the effectiveness of ScaPT, this paper evaluates it along with representational frameworks in Hanabi and confirms its superiority.

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) replaces global backpropagation with local optimization over weights and activations. We show that linear PC networks admit a natural formulation as cellular sheaves: the sheaf coboundary maps activations to edge-wise prediction errors, and PC inference is diffusion under the sheaf Laplacian. Sheaf cohomology then characterizes irreducible error patterns that inference cannot remove. We analyze recurrent topologies where feedback loops create internal contradictions, introducing prediction errors unrelated to supervision. Using a Hodge decomposition, we determine when these contradictions cause learning to stall. The sheaf formalism provides both diagnostic tools for identifying problematic network configurations and design principles for effective weight initialization for recurrent PC networks.

Abstract: Many Knowledege Graphs (KGs) are frequently updated, forcing their Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to adapt to these changes. To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.

Abstract: Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for financial institutions, as it enables the identification of potential fraud, operational issues, or other irregularities. Robust statistics is useful for flagging outliers and for providing estimates of the data distribution parameters that are not affected by contaminated observations. However, such a strategy is often less efficient and computationally expensive under high dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate empirically several robust approaches that may be computationally efficient in medium and high dimensional datasets, with high breakdown points and low computational time. Our application deals with around 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.

Abstract: Deep learning models for precipitation forecasting often function as black boxes, limiting their adoption in real-world weather prediction. To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata. This study demonstrates how explainable AI (xAI) can provide accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns in diverse urban environments.

Abstract: Many tasks in machine learning can be described as or reduced to learning a probability distribution given a finite set of samples. A common approach is to minimize a statistical divergence between the (empirical) data distribution and a parameterized distribution, e.g., a normalizing flow (NF) or an energy-based model (EBM). In this context, the forward KL divergence is a ubiquitous due to its tractability, though its asymmetry may prevent capturing some properties of the target distribution. Symmetric alternatives involve brittle min-max formulations and adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial networks) or evaluating the reverse KL divergence, as is the case for the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which is challenging to compute from samples. This work sets out to develop a new approach to minimize the Jeffreys divergence. To do so, it uses a proxy model whose goal is not only to fit the data, but also to assist in optimizing the Jeffreys divergence of the main model. This joint training task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to obtain a practical algorithm that adapts the models priorities throughout training. We illustrate how this framework can be used to combine the advantages of NFs and EBMs in tasks such as density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods. Our work is framed as a classification problem in which we try to predict whether surface air temperature will exceed its q-th local quantile within a specified timeframe. Our key finding is that aggregating ensemble predictions using a power mean significantly enhances the classifier's performance. By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.

Conclusion: SKF能统一两种框架，实现复杂时变非线性模型的实时推理，还能增强KF参数识别策略。

Abstract: Learning governing equations from data is central to understanding the behavior of physical systems across diverse scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, and engineering. The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants. We validate SKF on a chaotic Lorenz system with drifting or switching parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in the real-time identification of a sparse nonlinear aircraft model built from real flight data.

Conclusion: DGIMVCM能有效解决现有方法的问题，是一种有效的不完整多视图聚类方法。

Abstract: The prevalence of real-world multi-view data makes incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) a crucial research. The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic Deep \textbf{G}raph Learning for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{C}lustering with \textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DGIMVCM.

Result: 在超80平方公里多样未知环境验证，定位成功率超90%，较现有方法提升40%，搜索路径长度与初始距离线性相关。

Conclusion: LoRaCompass能在域偏移和信号波动下实现对LoRa标签的鲁棒高效搜索。

Abstract: The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.

Conclusion: 该方法能自适应地在最优轮次附近停止训练，节省计算资源，便于快速调整超参数。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points. Our approach adaptively stops training near the optimal round, thereby conserving computational resources and enabling rapid hyperparameter adjustments. Numerical results on multi-label chest X-ray classification demonstrate that our method reduces training rounds by up to 74% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the optimal.

Abstract: Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) are versatile detectors that reconstruct charged-particle tracks in an ionizing medium, enabling sensitive measurements across a wide range of nuclear physics experiments. We explore sparse convolutional networks for representation learning on TPC data, finding that a sparse ResNet architecture, even with randomly set weights, provides useful structured vector embeddings of events. Pre-training this architecture on a simple physics-motivated binary classification task further improves the embedding quality. Using data from the GAseous Detector with GErmanium Tagging (GADGET) II TPC, a detector optimized for measuring low-energy $β$-delayed particle decays, we represent raw pad-level signals as sparse tensors, train Minkowski Engine ResNet models, and probe the resulting event-level embeddings which reveal rich event structure. As a cross-detector test, we embed data from the Active-Target TPC (AT-TPC) -- a detector designed for nuclear reaction studies in inverse kinematics -- using the same encoder. We find that even an untrained sparse ResNet model provides useful embeddings of AT-TPC data, and we observe improvements when the model is trained on GADGET data. Together, these results highlight the potential of sparse convolutional techniques as a general tool for representation learning in diverse TPC experiments.

We evaluated CNN and autoencoder architectures for user authentication through simple digit patterns (0-9) traced with finger input. Twenty participants contributed 2,000 finger-drawn digits each on personal touchscreen devices. We compared two CNN architectures: a modified Inception-V1 network and a lightweight shallow CNN for mobile environments. Additionally, we examined Convolutional and Fully Connected autoencoders for anomaly detection. Both CNN architectures achieved ~89% authentication accuracy, with the shallow CNN requiring fewer parameters. Autoencoder approaches achieved ~75% accuracy. The results demonstrate that finger-drawn symbol authentication provides a viable, secure, and user-friendly biometric solution for touchscreen devices. This approach can be integrated with existing pattern-based authentication methods to create multi-layered security systems for mobile applications.

Conclusion: VWN不仅令牌效率高，且规模越大越有效，为探索虚拟宽度缩放作为大模型效率新维度提供基础。

Abstract: We introduce Virtual Width Networks (VWN), a framework that delivers the benefits of wider representations without incurring the quadratic cost of increasing the hidden size. VWN decouples representational width from backbone width, expanding the embedding space while keeping backbone compute nearly constant. In our large-scale experiment, an 8-times expansion accelerates optimization by over 2 times for next-token and 3 times for next-2-token prediction. The advantage amplifies over training as both the loss gap grows and the convergence-speedup ratio increases, showing that VWN is not only token-efficient but also increasingly effective with scale. Moreover, we identify an approximately log-linear scaling relation between virtual width and loss reduction, offering an initial empirical basis and motivation for exploring virtual-width scaling as a new dimension of large-model efficiency.

Conclusion: HealSplit具有更好的鲁棒性和防御有效性，是适用于SFL的有效统一防御框架。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.

Result: 在十一个属性图和四个大规模真实世界图基准上，NASK始终优于十六个最先进的基线。

Conclusion: NASK是一种有效的属性图学习图核，适用于基于核的学习框架。

Abstract: Attributed graphs, typically characterized by irregular topologies and a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, are ubiquitous in diverse domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics. While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.

Conclusion: EHR预测模型有临床潜力，可支持更精准、可扩展的癌症早期检测策略。

Abstract: Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a prominent strategy to significantly speed up generation in large language models (LLMs), including byte-level LLMs, which are tokeniser-free but prohibitively slow. However, existing MTP methods often sacrifice expressiveness by assuming independence between future tokens. In this work, we investigate the trade-off between expressiveness and latency in MTP within the framework of probabilistic circuits (PCs). Our framework, named MTPC, allows one to explore different ways to encode the joint distributions over future tokens by selecting different circuit architectures, generalising classical models such as (hierarchical) mixture models, hidden Markov models and tensor networks. We show the efficacy of MTPC by retrofitting existing byte-level LLMs, such as EvaByte. Our experiments show that, when combined with speculative decoding, MTPC significantly speeds up generation compared to MTP with independence assumptions, while guaranteeing to retain the performance of the original verifier LLM. We also rigorously study the optimal trade-off between expressiveness and latency when exploring the possible parameterisations of MTPC, such as PC architectures and partial layer sharing between the verifier and draft LLMs.

They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.

Motivation: 设备端微调在严格内存约束下需适应不同任务，传统BP训练内存开销大限制模型大小，需解决此瓶颈。

Method: 先对BP和MeZO训练可容纳的相对模型大小进行理论估算，再进行数值验证。

Result: MeZO虽可能增加微调时间，但能让更大模型适配片上内存，在有足够微调时间时，在设备内存受限下有精度优势。

Conclusion: MeZO能缓解设备端训练的内存瓶颈，在内存受限且有足够时间时表现更好。

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning is a critical capability for edge AI systems, which must support adaptation to different agentic tasks under stringent memory constraints. Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.

Motivation: 多数计算模型将基因视为孤立数值特征，忽略基因符号的生物语义，无法深入理解关键生物特征。

Result: 在公共空间转录组数据集上，SemST达到了最先进的聚类性能，FSM模块集成到其他基线方法中也能提升性能。

Conclusion: SemST框架有效解决了现有模型的局限性，FSM模块具有通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables gene expression profiling with spatial context, offering unprecedented insights into the tissue microenvironment. However, most computational models treat genes as isolated numerical features, ignoring the rich biological semantics encoded in their symbols. This prevents a truly deep understanding of critical biological characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we present SemST, a semantic-guided deep learning framework for spatial transcriptomics data clustering. SemST leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable genes to "speak" through their symbolic meanings, transforming gene sets within each tissue spot into biologically informed embeddings. These embeddings are then fused with the spatial neighborhood relationships captured by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), achieving a coherent integration of biological function and spatial structure. We further introduce the Fine-grained Semantic Modulation (FSM) module to optimally exploit these biological priors. The FSM module learns spot-specific affine transformations that empower the semantic embeddings to perform an element-wise calibration of the spatial features, thus dynamically injecting high-order biological knowledge into the spatial context. Extensive experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that SemST achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance. Crucially, the FSM module exhibits plug-and-play versatility, consistently improving the performance when integrated into other baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出带硬物理保证的光谱归一化替代方法用于机械均匀化正逆问题，在不同场景验证其效果好，可统一正预测与逆设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为机械均匀化的正问题和逆问题提供有硬物理保证的解决方案。

Method: 利用Voigt - Reuss边界，通过类Cholesky算子分解差异，学习无量纲、对称半正定表示；在不同场景采用全连接网络、CNN等模型。

Result: 在3D线性弹性和2D平面应变场景有高拟合度、低误差，能准确跟踪特征值跳跃，逆设计能匹配目标张量。

Conclusion: Voigt - Reuss网络可统一准确的正向预测和满足约束的逆向设计，适用于椭圆算子和多物理场耦合场景。

Abstract: We propose a spectrally normalized surrogate for forward and inverse mechanical homogenization with hard physical guarantees. Leveraging the Voigt-Reuss bounds, we factor their difference via a Cholesky-like operator and learn a dimensionless, symmetric positive semi-definite representation with eigenvalues in $[0,1]$; the inverse map returns symmetric positive-definite predictions that lie between the bounds in the Löwner sense. In 3D linear elasticity on an open dataset of stochastic biphasic microstructures, a fully connected Voigt-Reuss net trained on $>\!7.5\times 10^{5}$ FFT-based labels with 236 isotropy-invariant descriptors and three contrast parameters recovers the isotropic projection with near-perfect fidelity (isotropy-related entries: $R^2 \ge 0.998$), while anisotropy-revealing couplings are unidentifiable from $SO(3)$-invariant inputs. Tensor-level relative Frobenius errors have median $\approx 1.7\%$ and mean $\approx 3.4\%$ across splits. For 2D plane strain on thresholded trigonometric microstructures, coupling spectral normalization with a differentiable renderer and a CNN yields $R^2>0.99$ on all components, subpercent normalized losses, accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution images. Treating the parametric microstructure as design variables, batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate matches target tensors within a few percent and returns diverse near-optimal designs. Overall, the Voigt-Reuss net unifies accurate, physically admissible forward prediction with large-batch, constraint-consistent inverse design, and is generic to elliptic operators and coupled-physics settings.

Abstract: Phase-time arrays, which integrate phase shifters (PSs) and true-time delays (TTDs), have emerged as a cost-effective architecture for generating frequency-dependent rainbow beams in wideband sensing and localization. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based scheme that simultaneously designs the rainbow beams and estimates user positions. Treating the PS and TTD coefficients as trainable variables allows the network to synthesize task-oriented beams that maximize localization accuracy. A lightweight fully connected module then recovers the user's angle-range coordinates from its feedback of the maximum quantized received power and its corresponding subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission. Compared with existing analytical and learning-based schemes, the proposed method reduces overhead by an order of magnitude and delivers consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.

Abstract: Autonomous spacecraft control for mission phases such as launch, ascent, stage separation, and orbit insertion remains a critical challenge due to the need for adaptive policies that generalize across dynamically distinct regimes. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.

Result: 理论分析给出量化下生成退化上限，在五个不同复杂度基准数据集上实验表明，OT量化在每个参数2 - 3比特时仍能保持视觉生成质量和潜在空间稳定性，其他方法失败。

Conclusion: OT量化是一种有原则、有效的压缩FM生成模型的方法，适用于边缘和嵌入式AI应用。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) generative models offer efficient simulation-free training and deterministic sampling, but their practical deployment is challenged by high-precision parameter requirements. We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.

Result: 在恶意软件检测中提高保留分数，在二进制摘要中BLEU分数翻倍，跨表示泛化超所有基线。

Conclusion: RETROFIT能有效减少遗忘并保持适应性，在安全分析中有良好表现。

Abstract: Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.
  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high quality images but inference is costly due to many denoising steps and heavy matrix operations. We present DiffPro, a post-training, hardware-faithful framework that works with the exact integer kernels used in deployment and jointly tunes timesteps and per-layer precision in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce latency and memory without any training. DiffPro combines three parts: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric to allocate weight bits, dynamic activation quantization to stabilize activations across timesteps, and a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift. In experiments DiffPro achieves up to 6.25x model compression, fifty percent fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with Delta FID <= 10 on standard benchmarks, demonstrating practical efficiency gains. DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a single budgeted deployable plan for real-time energy-aware diffusion inference.

Conclusion: FairReweighing算法能有效解决回归公平性问题，提高AI软件决策的公平性。

Abstract: There has been a prevalence of applying AI software in both high-stakes public-sector and industrial contexts. However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: 可根据模型非线性和噪声特性选择递归和直接策略，而非传统的偏差 - 方差直觉。

Abstract: Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.

Abstract: We present a pure machine learning process for synthesizing radar spectrograms from Motion-Capture (MoCap) data. We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.
  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.

Abstract: Conformal prediction constructs a set of labels instead of a single point prediction, while providing a probabilistic coverage guarantee. Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.

Abstract: Understanding reactor-pressure-vessel steel microstructure is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, as carbide precipitates both strengthen the alloy and can initiate cracks.

Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.

Abstract: In this work, we estimate the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset using a score-based diffusion model. We examine how the iD estimates vary as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure how similar the radio sources are to the MiraBest subset of the RGZ dataset. We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the overall iD for RGZ exceeds those typically reported for natural image datasets. Furthermore, we analyse how iD varies across Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological classes and as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While no relationship is found between FR I and FR II classes, a weak trend toward higher SNR at lower iD. Future work using the RGZ dataset could make use of the relationship between iD and energy scores to quantitatively study and improve the representations learned by various self-supervised learning algorithms.

Conclusion: 弃权可作为一流的训练目标，将“我不知道”转化为协调信号，让模型通过诚实展现自身局限赢得信任。

Abstract: Modern language models fail a fundamental requirement of trustworthy intelligence: knowing when not to answer. Despite achieving impressive accuracy on benchmarks, these models produce confident hallucinations, even when wrong answers carry catastrophic consequences. Our evaluations on GSM8K, MedQA and GPQA show frontier models almost never abstain despite explicit warnings of severe penalties, suggesting that prompts cannot override training that rewards any answer over no answer. As a remedy, we propose Reinforced Hesitation (RH): a modification to Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to use ternary rewards (+1 correct, 0 abstention, -$λ$ error) instead of binary. Controlled experiments on logic puzzles reveal that varying $λ$ produces distinct models along a Pareto frontier, where each training penalty yields the optimal model for its corresponding risk regime: low penalties produce aggressive answerers, high penalties conservative abstainers. We then introduce two inference strategies that exploit trained abstention as a coordination signal: cascading routes queries through models with decreasing risk tolerance, while self-cascading re-queries the same model on abstention. Both outperform majority voting with lower computational cost. These results establish abstention as a first-class training objective that transforms ``I don't know'' from failure into a coordination signal, enabling models to earn trust through calibrated honesty about their limits.

Motivation: 解决分布式环境下混合专家模型（MoEs）运行时阻塞通信的问题。

Method: 提出FarSkip - Collective，修改模型架构跳过连接，还使用自蒸馏方法转换模型。

Result: 将参数从16B到109B的一系列最先进模型转换，实现通信重叠，精度与原开源版本相当，如Llama 4 Scout (109B)平均准确率与指令调优版本相差在1%以内。

Conclusion: FarSkip - Collective能在保持大模型精度的同时，通过优化实现计算与通信重叠，加速现有框架的训练和推理。

Abstract: Blocking communication presents a major hurdle in running MoEs efficiently in distributed settings. To address this, we present FarSkip-Collective which modifies the architecture of modern models to enable overlapping of their computation with communication. Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases. For example, we convert Llama 4 Scout (109B) via self-distillation and achieve average accuracy within 1% of its instruction tuned release averaged across a wide range of downstream evaluations. In addition to demonstrating retained accuracy of the large modified models, we realize the benefits of FarSkip-Collective through optimized implementations that explicitly overlap communication with computation, accelerating both training and inference in existing frameworks.

Conclusion: 推广最近公平聚类问题研究，解决相关公开问题，推动公平聚类领域发展。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, but it frequently fails to provide fair representation for various marginalized communities defined by multiple protected attributes -- a shortcoming often caused by biases in the training data. As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.
  In this work, we generalize the study of the \emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].
  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020]. Additionally, we are the first to provide approximation algorithms for the \emph{fair consensus clustering} problem involving multiple (more than two) groups, thus addressing another open direction highlighted by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].

Motivation: 探索自注意力动力学与已有动力学系统的联系，研究其均衡点特性。

Method: 分析自注意力动力学与Oja流多智能体版本的关联，对单头自注意力系统的均衡点进行分类。

Result: 自注意力动力学与Oja流多智能体版本相关，单头自注意力系统的均衡点分为四类，前三类存在多个渐近稳定均衡点，前两类均衡点常与值矩阵特征向量对齐。

Conclusion: 明确了自注意力动力学与Oja流多智能体版本的联系，以及均衡点与值矩阵特征向量的关系。

Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.

TL;DR: 研究MoBA性能设计原则，提出统计模型，确定改进途径，引入FlashMoBA并验证效果，实现提速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoBA虽能处理长文本但性能设计原则不明且缺乏高效GPU实现，阻碍实际应用。

Method: 开发统计模型分析MoBA机制，推导信噪比；确定使用小尺寸块和对键应用短卷积的改进途径；引入硬件感知的CUDA内核FlashMoBA。

Result: 改进的MoBA模型性能与密集注意力基线相当，FlashMoBA在小块上比FlashAttention - 2提速达14.7倍。

Conclusion: 理论改进具有实用性，代码开源。

Abstract: Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

Conclusion: 新基准测试套件可弥补现有套件不足，适用于面向应用的优化场景。

Abstract: Benchmarking is essential for developing and evaluating black-box optimization algorithms, providing a structured means to analyze their search behavior. Its effectiveness relies on carefully selected problem sets used for evaluation. To date, most established benchmark suites for black-box optimization consist of abstract or synthetic problems that only partially capture the complexities of real-world engineering applications, thereby severely limiting the insights that can be gained for application-oriented optimization scenarios and reducing their practical impact. To close this gap, we propose a new benchmarking suite that addresses it by presenting a curated set of optimization benchmarks rooted in structural mechanics. The current implemented benchmarks are derived from vehicle crashworthiness scenarios, which inherently require the use of gradient-free algorithms due to the non-smooth, highly non-linear nature of the underlying models. Within this paper, the reader will find descriptions of the physical context of each case, the corresponding optimization problem formulations, and clear guidelines on how to employ the suite.

Motivation: 现有自动程序修复（APR）基准依赖执行评估方法，无法捕捉补丁真实有效性，人工标注成本高，需降低成本。

Method: 采用人在回路方法，先让LLM生成每个bug的评判标准，经人工审核和优化，再用优化后的标准让LLM判断补丁有效性。

Result: 在人类评判一致的补丁上，与人类共识一致性高（Cohen's kappa 0.75），召回率0.94，精度0.80；在人类评判有分歧的完整数据集上，Cohen's kappa 0.57，召回率0.93，精度0.65。

Conclusion: 该方法有较好效果，在完整数据集上仍有提升空间，可确定未来改进方向。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is crucial for advancing Automated Program Repair (APR), but prevailing benchmarks rely on execution-based evaluation methods (unit test pass@k), which fail to capture true patch validity. Determining validity can require costly manual annotation. To reduce this cost, we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to LLM-based patch validity judgment. Inspired by the observation that human judgment is better aligned when using a shared rubric, we first employ an LLM to generate a per-bug rubric, followed by a one-time human review and optional refinement to this rubric, and then employ an LLM to judge patches using the refined rubric. We apply this approach to assign binary validity labels to patches for issues found by Google sanitizer tools. Our results show that this approach yields substantial agreement with human consensus (Cohen's kappa 0.75), high recall (0.94) and high precision (0.80), when considering patches that have unanimous agreement from 3 human raters on the validity labels. On the full dataset including patches where human raters disagree, we find this approach can still be further improved (Cohen's kappa 0.57, recall 0.93, precision 0.65) and identify possible future directions.

Motivation: 现代计算机系统复杂性增加，运行时可能出现控制流异常，需检测。

Method: 提出用大语言模型和一致性检查开发软件监视器的方法，利用大语言模型连接设计模型与代码，自动化代码插桩，用一致性检查分析事件日志。

Result: 在铁路标准案例中，大语言模型代码插桩控制流覆盖率达84.775%，一致性检查异常检测F1分数达96.610%，AUC达93.515%。

Conclusion: 纳入领域知识指导大语言模型代码插桩可获得可靠日志，通过一致性检查实现有效异常检测。

Abstract: Context: Ensuring high levels of dependability in modern computer-based systems has become increasingly challenging due to their complexity. Although systems are validated at design time, their behavior can be different at run-time, possibly showing control-flow anomalies due to "unknown unknowns".
  Objective: We aim to detect control-flow anomalies through software monitoring, which verifies run-time behavior by logging software execution and detecting deviations from expected control flow.
  Methods: We propose a methodology to develop software monitors for control-flow anomaly detection through Large Language Models (LLMs) and conformance checking. The methodology builds on existing software development practices to maintain traditional V&V while providing an additional level of robustness and trustworthiness. It leverages LLMs to link design-time models and implementation code, automating source-code instrumentation. The resulting event logs are analyzed via conformance checking, an explainable and effective technique for control-flow anomaly detection.
  Results: We test the methodology on a case-study scenario from the European Railway Traffic Management System / European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS), which is a railway standard for modern interoperable railways. The results obtained from the ERTMS/ETCS case study demonstrate that LLM-based source-code instrumentation can achieve up to 84.775% control-flow coverage of the reference design-time process model, while the subsequent conformance checking-based anomaly detection reaches a peak performance of 96.610% F1-score and 93.515% AUC.
  Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge to guide LLMs in source-code instrumentation significantly allowed obtaining reliable and quality software logs and enabled effective control-flow anomaly detection through conformance checking.

Motivation: 传统自动程序修复多关注单块缺陷，忽视现实中常见的多块代码缺陷，需对大语言模型驱动的编码代理在该任务上进行系统研究。

Method: 在Hunk4J数据集的372个多块代码缺陷上评估Claude Code、Codex等编码代理，用细粒度指标分析1488条修复轨迹；开发Maple提供仓库级上下文。

Result: 修复准确率从25.8%（Qwen Code）到93.3%（Claude Code），随缺陷分散和复杂度增加而下降；高表现代理语义一致性好、减少回归问题，低表现代理易引入新测试失败；失败修复消耗更多资源和时间；Maple使Gemini - cli修复准确率提升30%。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度指标和轨迹级分析，能解释编码代理在多块代码修复中的定位、推理和行动过程。

Abstract: Automated program repair has traditionally focused on single-hunk defects, overlooking multi-hunk bugs that are prevalent in real-world systems. Repairing these bugs requires coordinated edits across multiple, disjoint code regions, posing substantially greater challenges. We present the first systematic study of LLM-driven coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini-cli, and Qwen Code) on this task. We evaluate these agents on 372 multi-hunk bugs from the Hunk4J dataset, analyzing 1,488 repair trajectories using fine-grained metrics that capture localization, repair accuracy, regression behavior, and operational dynamics. Results reveal substantial variation: repair accuracy ranges from 25.8% (Qwen Code) to 93.3% (Claude Code) and consistently declines with increasing bug dispersion and complexity. High-performing agents demonstrate superior semantic consistency, achieving positive regression reduction, whereas lower-performing agents often introduce new test failures. Notably, agents do not fail fast; failed repairs consume substantially more resources (39%-343% more tokens) and require longer execution time (43%-427%). Additionally, we developed Maple to provide agents with repository-level context. Empirical results show that Maple improves the repair accuracy of Gemini-cli by 30% through enhanced localization. By analyzing fine-grained metrics and trajectory-level analysis, this study moves beyond accuracy to explain how coding agents localize, reason, and act during multi-hunk repair.

Abstract: How to best use Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering is covered in many publications in recent years. However, most of this work focuses on widely-used general purpose programming languages. The utility of LLMs for software within the industrial process automation domain, with highly-specialized languages that are typically only used in proprietary contexts, is still underexplored. Within this paper, we study enterprises can achieve on their own without investing large amounts of effort into the training of models specific to the domain-specific languages that are used. We show that few-shot prompting approaches are sufficient to solve simple problems in a language that is otherwise not well-supported by an LLM and that is possible on-premise, thereby ensuring the protection of sensitive company data.

Abstract: Software quality research increasingly relies on large-scale datasets that measure both the product and process aspects of software systems. However, existing resources often focus on limited dimensions, such as code smells, technical debt, or refactoring activity, thereby restricting comprehensive analyses across time and quality dimensions. To address this gap, we present the Software Quality Dataset (SQuaD), a multi-dimensional, time-aware collection of software quality metrics extracted from 450 mature open-source projects across diverse ecosystems, including Apache, Mozilla, FFmpeg, and the Linux kernel. By integrating nine state-of-the-art static analysis tools, i.e., SonarQube, CodeScene, PMD, Understand, CK, JaSoMe, RefactoringMiner, RefactoringMiner++, and PyRef, our dataset unifies over 700 unique metrics at method, class, file, and project levels. Covering a total of 63,586 analyzed project releases, SQuaD also provides version control and issue-tracking histories, software vulnerability data (CVE/CWE), and process metrics proven to enhance Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. The SQuaD enables empirical research on maintainability, technical debt, software evolution, and quality assessment at unprecedented scale. We also outline emerging research directions, including automated dataset updates and cross-project quality modeling to support the continuous evolution of software analytics. The dataset is publicly available on ZENODO (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17566690).

Conclusion: SCRUTINEER系统能准确、稳健地检测SCRs逻辑级使用违规。

Abstract: Smart Contract Reusable Components(SCRs) play a vital role in accelerating the development of business-specific contracts by promoting modularity and code reuse. However, the risks associated with SCR usage violations have become a growing concern. One particular type of SCR usage violation, known as a logic-level usage violation, is becoming especially harmful. This violation occurs when the SCR adheres to its specified usage rules but fails to align with the specific business logic of the current context, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Detecting such violations necessitates a deep semantic understanding of the contract's business logic, including the ability to extract implicit usage patterns and analyze fine-grained logical behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose SCRUTINEER, the first automated and practical system for detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs. First, we design a composite feature extraction approach that produces three complementary feature representations, supporting subsequent analysis. We then introduce a Large Language Model-powered knowledge construction framework, which leverages comprehension-oriented prompts and domain-specific tools to extract logic-level usage and build the SCR knowledge base. Next, we develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-driven inspector, which combines a rapid retrieval strategy with both comprehensive and targeted analysis to identify potentially insecure logic-level usages. Finally, we implement a logic-level usage violation analysis engine that integrates a similarity-based checker and a snapshot-based inference conflict checker to enable accurate and robust detection. We evaluate SCRUTINEER from multiple perspectives on 3 ground-truth datasets. The results show that SCRUTINEER achieves a precision of 80.77%, a recall of 82.35%, and an F1-score of 81.55% in detecting logic-level usage violations of SCRs.

Conclusion: 适当调整后，敏捷方法能与航空航天等高度监管领域的安全系统开发和认证要求共存，并提高效率。

Abstract: Agile methods are characterised by iterative and incremental processes with a strong focus on flexibility and accommodating changing requirements based on either technical, regulatory, or stakeholder feedback. However, integrating Agile methods into safety-critical system development in the aerospace industry presents substantial challenges due to its strict compliance requirements, such as those outlined in the DO-178C standard. To achieve this vision, the flexibility of Agile must align with the rigorous certification guidelines, which emphasize documentation, traceability of requirements across different levels and disciplines, and comprehensive verification and validation (V&V) activities. The research work described in this paper proposes a way of using the strengths of the flexible nature of Agile methods to automate and manage change requests throughout the whole software development lifecycle, ensuring robust traceability, regulatory compliance and ultimately facilitating successful certification. This study proposes CertiA360, a tool designed to help teams improve requirement maturity, automate the changes in traceability, and align with the regulatory objectives. The tool was designed and validated in close collaboration with aerospace industry experts, using their feedback to ensure practical application and real-life effectiveness. The feedback collected demonstrated that the automation given by CertiA360 may reduce manual effort and allow response to changing requirements while ensuring compliance with DO-178C. While the tool is not yet qualified under DO-330 (Tool Qualification), findings suggest that when tailored appropriately, Agile methods can not only coexist with the requirements of safety-system development and certification in highly regulated domains like aerospace, but also add efficiency.

Result: DRL代理成功稳定波动，但因过度保守的策略收敛导致风险调整回报下降。

Conclusion: 需要改进奖励塑造和采用混合风险感知策略，以提升DRL投资组合分配模型的实际应用。

Abstract: This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for dynamic portfolio optimization under market uncertainty and risk. The proposed model integrates a Sharpe ratio-based reward function with direct risk control mechanisms, including maximum drawdown and volatility constraints. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn adaptive asset allocation strategies over historical financial time series. Model performance is benchmarked against mean-variance and equal-weight portfolio strategies using backtesting on high-performing equities. Results indicate that the DRL agent stabilizes volatility successfully but suffers from degraded risk-adjusted returns due to over-conservative policy convergence, highlighting the challenge of balancing exploration, return maximization, and risk mitigation. The study underscores the need for improved reward shaping and hybrid risk-aware strategies to enhance the practical deployment of DRL-based portfolio allocation models.

Abstract: As life expectancy in Kenya increases, so does the need for efficient pension schemes that can secure a dignified retirement and protect members from old age poverty. Limited research, however, has explored the efficiency of these schemes under existing governance structures. This study addresses that gap by examining the combined effects of corporate governance, risk management, and industry regulation on pension scheme efficiency in Kenya. Using a quantitative design, we conducted a panel regression analysis on a seven-year secondary dataset of 128 Kenyan pension schemes, totaling 896 observations. Our results reveal significant insights That the presence of employee representatives on the board and effective risk management have a significant positive effect on efficiency. Conversely, independent board members exhibit a significant negative effect. Other factors, including top management representation, female board members, and industry regulation, showed no significant effect on efficiency in the joint model. These findings suggest that the impact of governance and risk management on efficiency is nuanced, with specific factors like employee representation playing a more prominent role. We propose that the electoral process for employee board members may introduce a Self Cleaning Mechanism that progressively enhances scheme efficiency. This mechanism offers a novel theoretical extension of Agency Theory, explaining the convergence of interests between elected trustees and scheme members.

Motivation: 寻求不单独建模来确定违约后LGD的方法。

Method: 利用违约前LGD模型、计算违约后平均还款时间等，提出基于平均后验分布估计来预测回收的LGD(t)变体。

Result: 对回收组合进行分析，展示所需数量的近似统计。

Conclusion: 只要知道贷款金额、还款日期和利率，该解决方案可用于为任何违约贷款构建违约后LGD模型。

Abstract: The proposed work shows how to determine the Loss Given Default (LGD) after default without preparing a separate model. This requires the following: LGD model before default, the calculation of the average repayment time after default, the values of the volumes and moments of repayments after default, along with the lending rate for each loan, and the recovery rate recorded in the default volume. The LGD(t) variant is proposed, which predicts recovery based on the estimation of the average posterior distribution. An analysis is conducted on recovery portfolios, demonstrating the approximate statistics of the desired quantity. The solution allows you to build an LGD model after default for any default loans, provided that you know the volumes, repayment dates, and interest rates.

Conclusion: 风险管理是关键保障，使治理结构更有效，促进计划整体绩效提升。

Abstract: The efficiency of pension schemes in Kenya invites elevated interest owing to the increasing pension contribution amounts and the expectation that benefits paid out of these schemes would protect members from old age poverty. The study investigates the intervening effect of risk management on the relationship between corporate governance and the efficiency of pension schemes in Kenya. The study employs panel data consisting of 896 observations from 128 schemes in a sample period from 2015 to 2021. The study finds that risk management significantly mediates the relationship between employee representatives on the board of trustees, as a component of corporate governance, and the efficiency of pension schemes. Consequently, the mediation effect of risk management indicates that when employee representatives are involved in governance, the presence of strong risk management practices ensures that their contributions lead to improved efficiency. Risk management, therefore, serves as a critical safeguard that enables governance structures to function more effectively and contribute to the overall performance of the scheme.

Abstract: We study the estimation problem of distribution-on-distribution regression, where both predictors and responses are probability measures. Existing approaches typically rely on a global optimal transport map or tangent-space linearization, which can be restrictive in approximation capacity and distort geometry in multivariate underlying domains. In this paper, we propose the \emph{Neural Local Wasserstein Regression}, a flexible nonparametric framework that models regression through locally defined transport maps in Wasserstein space. Our method builds on the analogy with classical kernel regression: kernel weights based on the 2-Wasserstein distance localize estimators around reference measures, while neural networks parameterize transport operators that adapt flexibly to complex data geometries. This localized perspective broadens the class of admissible transformations and avoids the limitations of global map assumptions and linearization structures. We develop a practical training procedure using DeepSets-style architectures and Sinkhorn-approximated losses, combined with a greedy reference selection strategy for scalability. Through synthetic experiments on Gaussian and mixture models, as well as distributional prediction tasks on MNIST, we demonstrate that our approach effectively captures nonlinear and high-dimensional distributional relationships that elude existing methods.

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning presents unique challenges due to the lack of explicitly labeled negative samples, particularly in high-stakes domains such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis. To address data scarcity and privacy constraints, we propose a novel transfer learning with model averaging framework that integrates information from heterogeneous data sources - including fully binary labeled, semi-supervised, and PU data sets - without direct data sharing. For each source domain type, a tailored logistic regression model is conducted, and knowledge is transferred to the PU target domain through model averaging. Optimal weights for combining source models are determined via a cross-validation criterion that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We establish theoretical guarantees for weight optimality and convergence, covering both misspecified and correctly specified target models, with further extensions to high-dimensional settings using sparsity-penalized estimators. Extensive simulations and real-world credit risk data analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms other comparative methods in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness, especially under limited labeled data and heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the nonparametric estimation of the drift function over a compact domain for a time-homogeneous diffusion process, based on high-frequency discrete observations from $N$ independent trajectories. We propose a neural network-based estimator and derive a non-asymptotic convergence rate, decomposed into a training error, an approximation error, and a diffusion-related term scaling as ${\log N}/{N}$. For compositional drift functions, we establish an explicit rate. In the numerical experiments, we consider a drift function with local fluctuations generated by a double-layer compositional structure featuring local oscillations, and show that the empirical convergence rate becomes independent of the input dimension $d$. Compared to the $B$-spline method, the neural network estimator achieves better convergence rates and more effectively captures local features, particularly in higher-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Linear models are widely used in high-stakes decision-making due to their simplicity and interpretability. Yet when fairness constraints such as demographic parity are introduced, their effects on model coefficients, and thus on how predictive bias is distributed across features, remain opaque. Existing approaches on linear models often rely on strong and unrealistic assumptions, or overlook the explicit role of the sensitive attribute, limiting their practical utility for fairness assessment. We extend the work of (Chzhen and Schreuder, 2022) and (Fukuchi and Sakuma, 2023) by proposing a post-processing framework that can be applied on top of any linear model to decompose the resulting bias into direct (sensitive-attribute) and indirect (correlated-features) components. Our method analytically characterizes how demographic parity reshapes each model coefficient, including those of both sensitive and non-sensitive features. This enables a transparent, feature-level interpretation of fairness interventions and reveals how bias may persist or shift through correlated variables. Our framework requires no retraining and provides actionable insights for model auditing and mitigation. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method captures fairness dynamics missed by prior work, offering a practical and interpretable tool for responsible deployment of linear models.

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are widely used metamodels for approximating expensive computer simulations, particularly in engineering design and spatial prediction. However, their performance can deteriorate significantly when covariance parameters are poorly estimated, highlighting the importance of accurate inference. The most common approach involves maximizing the marginal likelihood, yielding point estimates of these parameters. However, this approach is highly sensitive to initialization and optimization settings. An alternative is to adopt a fully Bayesian hierarchical framework, where the posterior distribution over the covariance parameters is inferred. This approach provides more robust uncertainty quantification and reduces sensitivity to parameter selection. Yet, a key challenge lies in the careful specification of prior distributions for these parameters. While many available software packages provide default priors, their influence on model behavior is often underexplored. Additionally, the choice of proposal distributions can also influence sampling efficiency and convergence. In this paper, we examine how different prior and proposal distributions over the lengthscale parameters $θ$ affect predictive performance in a hierarchical GP model, using both simulated and real data experiments. By evaluating various types of priors and proposals, we aim to better understand their influence on predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm has been extensively studied in the estimation and simulation literature, with most prior work focusing on convergence behavior and asymptotic theory. However, its covariance structure-an important statistical property for both theory and implementation-remains less understood. In this work, we provide new theoretical insights into the scalar case, focusing primarily on symmetric unimodal target distributions with symmetric random walk proposals, where we also establish an optimal proposal design. In addition, we derive some more general results beyond this setting. For the high-dimensional case, we relate the covariance matrix to the classical 0.23 average acceptance rate tuning criterion.

Abstract: In probabilistic modeling, parameter estimation is commonly formulated as a minimization problem on a parameter manifold. Optimization in such spaces requires geometry-aware methods that respect the underlying information structure. While the natural gradient leverages the Fisher information metric as a form of Riemannian gradient descent, it remains a first-order method and often exhibits slow convergence near optimal solutions. Existing second-order manifold algorithms typically rely on the Levi-Civita connection, thus overlooking the dual-connection structure that is central to information geometry. We propose the dual Riemannian Newton method, a Newton-type optimization algorithm on manifolds endowed with a metric and a pair of dual affine connections. The dual Riemannian Newton method explicates how duality shapes second-order updates: when the retraction (a local surrogate of the exponential map) is defined by one connection, the associated Newton equation is posed with its dual. We establish local quadratic convergence and validate the theory with experiments on representative statistical models. Thus, the dual Riemannian Newton method thus delivers second-order efficiency while remaining compatible with the dual structures that underlie modern information-geometric learning and inference.

Result: 基于数据分割的方法能为MCS提供通用解决方案，可正式研究简单和复杂模型的表现。

Conclusion: 提出的MCS框架有效，基于数据分割方法可行，能对比不同复杂度模型性能。

Abstract: Classical model selection seeks to find a single model within a particular class that optimizes some pre-specified criteria, such as maximizing a likelihood or minimizing a risk. More recently, there has been an increased interest in model set selection (MSS), where the aim is to identify a (confidence) set of near-optimal models. Here, we generalize the MSS framework further by introducing the idea of model class selection (MCS). In MCS, multiple model collections are evaluated, and all collections that contain at least one optimal model are sought for identification. Under mild conditions, data splitting based approaches are shown to provide general solutions for MCS. As a direct consequence, for particular datasets we are able to investigate formally whether classes of simpler and more interpretable statistical models are able to perform on par with more complex black-box machine learning models. A variety of simulated and real-data experiments are provided.

Abstract: We study randomized experiments in bipartite systems where only a subset of treatment-side units are eligible for assignment while all units continue to interact, generating interference. We formalize eligibility-constrained bipartite experiments and define estimands aligned with full deployment: the Primary Total Treatment Effect (PTTE) on eligible units and the Secondary Total Treatment Effect (STTE) on ineligible units. Under randomization within the eligible set, we give identification conditions and develop interference-aware ensemble estimators that combine exposure mappings, generalized propensity scores, and flexible machine learning. We further introduce a projection that links treatment- and outcome-level estimands; this mapping is exact under a Linear Additive Edges condition and enables estimation on the (typically much smaller) treatment side with deterministic aggregation to outcomes. In simulations with known ground truth across realistic exposure regimes, the proposed estimators recover PTTE and STTE with low bias and variance and reduce the bias that could arise when interference is ignored. Two field experiments illustrate practical relevance: our method corrects the direction of expected interference bias for a pre-specified metric in both studies and reverses the sign and significance of the primary decision metric in one case.

Conclusion: 强调TTS存在未被充分探索的内容中心滥用风险，需要在训练和部署中建立强大的跨模态防护。

Abstract: Modern text-to-speech (TTS) systems, particularly those built on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), generate high-fidelity speech that faithfully reproduces input text and mimics specified speaker identities. While prior misuse studies have focused on speaker impersonation, this work explores a distinct content-centric threat: exploiting TTS systems to produce speech containing harmful content. Realizing such threats poses two core challenges: (1) LALM safety alignment frequently rejects harmful prompts, yet existing jailbreak attacks are ill-suited for TTS because these systems are designed to faithfully vocalize any input text, and (2) real-world deployment pipelines often employ input/output filters that block harmful text and audio.
  We present HARMGEN, a suite of five attacks organized into two families that address these challenges. The first family employs semantic obfuscation techniques (Concat, Shuffle) that conceal harmful content within text. The second leverages audio-modality exploits (Read, Spell, Phoneme) that inject harmful content through auxiliary audio channels while maintaining benign textual prompts. Through evaluation across five commercial LALMs-based TTS systems and three datasets spanning two languages, we demonstrate that our attacks substantially reduce refusal rates and increase the toxicity of generated speech.
  We further assess both reactive countermeasures deployed by audio-streaming platforms and proactive defenses implemented by TTS providers. Our analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities: deepfake detectors underperform on high-fidelity audio; reactive moderation can be circumvented by adversarial perturbations; while proactive moderation detects 57-93% of attacks. Our work highlights a previously underexplored content-centric misuse vector for TTS and underscore the need for robust cross-modal safeguards throughout training and deployment.

Abstract: Recognizing speaker intent in long audio dialogues among speakers has a wide range of applications, but is a non-trivial AI task due to complex inter-dependencies in speaker utterances and scarce annotated data. To address these challenges, an end-to-end framework, namely DialogGraph-LLM, is proposed in the current work. DialogGraph-LLM combines a novel Multi-Relational Dialogue Attention Network (MR-DAN) architecture with multimodal foundation models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Omni-7B) for direct acoustic-to-intent inference. An adaptive semi-supervised learning strategy is designed using LLM with a confidence-aware pseudo-label generation mechanism based on dual-threshold filtering using both global and class confidences, and an entropy-based sample selection process that prioritizes high-information unlabeled instances. Extensive evaluations on the proprietary MarketCalls corpus and the publicly available MIntRec 2.0 benchmark demonstrate DialogGraph-LLM's superiority over strong audio and text-driven baselines. The framework demonstrates strong performance and efficiency in intent recognition in real world scenario audio dialogues, proving its practical value for audio-rich domains with limited supervision.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) speech decoding has emerged as a promising tool for assisting individuals with speech impairments. In this context, the integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals offers strong potential for enhancing decoding performance. Mandarin tone classification presents particular challenges, as tonal variations convey distinct meanings even when phonemes remain identical. In this study, we propose a novel cross-subject multimodal BCI decoding framework that fuses EEG and EMG signals to classify four Mandarin tones under both audible and silent speech conditions. Inspired by the cooperative mechanisms of neural and muscular systems in speech production, our neural decoding architecture combines spatial-temporal feature extraction branches with a cross-attention fusion mechanism, enabling informative interaction between modalities. We further incorporate domain-adversarial training to improve cross-subject generalization. We collected 4,800 EEG trials and 4,800 EMG trials from 10 participants using only twenty EEG and five EMG channels, demonstrating the feasibility of minimal-channel decoding. Despite employing lightweight modules, our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all conditions, achieving average classification accuracies of 87.83% for audible speech and 88.08% for silent speech. In cross-subject evaluations, it still maintains strong performance with accuracies of 83.27% and 85.10% for audible and silent speech, respectively. We further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component. Our findings suggest that tone-level decoding with minimal EEG-EMG channels is feasible and potentially generalizable across subjects, contributing to the development of practical BCI applications.

Abstract: We propose a framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) by combining perturbation theory with one-shot transfer learning in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Nonlinear PDEs with polynomial terms are decomposed into a sequence of linear subproblems, which are efficiently solved using a Multi-Head PINN. Once the latent representation of the linear operator is learned, solutions to new PDE instances with varying perturbations, forcing terms, or boundary/initial conditions can be obtained in closed form without retraining.
  We validate the method on KPP-Fisher and wave equations, achieving errors on the order of 1e-3 while adapting to new problem instances in under 0.2 seconds; comparable accuracy to classical solvers but with faster transfer. Sensitivity analyses show predictable error growth with epsilon and polynomial degree, clarifying the method's effective regime.
  Our contributions are: (i) extending one-shot transfer learning from nonlinear ODEs to PDEs, (ii) deriving a closed-form solution for adapting to new PDE instances, and (iii) demonstrating accuracy and efficiency on canonical nonlinear PDEs. We conclude by outlining extensions to derivative-dependent nonlinearities and higher-dimensional PDEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDL虽展示出优势，但模态组合能提升性能的假设未充分验证，探究多模态增益与单模态预测质量的关系。

Method: 在前列腺癌数据集上，结合组织病理学、放射学和临床数据预测生化复发时间来验证假设。

Result: 高性能模态组合比单模态方法性能更优，低性能模态与高性能模态集成会降低预测准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态优势需选择性、按性能导向集成，对计算病理学和医学影像的MDL设计有启示。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has emerged as a transformative approach in computational pathology. By integrating complementary information from multiple data sources, MDL models have demonstrated superior predictive performance across diverse clinical tasks compared to unimodal models. However, the assumption that combining modalities inherently improves performance remains largely unexamined. We hypothesise that multimodal gains depend critically on the predictive quality of individual modalities, and that integrating weak modalities may introduce noise rather than complementary information. We test this hypothesis on a prostate cancer dataset with histopathology, radiology, and clinical data to predict time-to-biochemical recurrence. Our results confirm that combining high-performing modalities yield superior performance compared to unimodal approaches. However, integrating a poor-performing modality with other higher-performing modalities degrades predictive accuracy. These findings demonstrate that multimodal benefit requires selective, performance-guided integration rather than indiscriminate modality combination, with implications for MDL design across computational pathology and medical imaging.

TL;DR: 本文将摘要计算历史的摘要概念用于竞态检测，在Goblint中实现并评估，结合多种摘要使正确解决任务数大幅增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用静态分析证明数据竞态不存在，将摘要概念用于竞态检测。

Method: 将摘要概念扩展到竞态检测，用摘要捕获冲突访问不会并行发生的条件，在Goblint中实现并在SV - COMP基准套件上评估。

Result: 结合锁集摘要、线程ID和线程连接摘要推理，比仅使用锁集推理正确解决任务数增加超五倍。

Conclusion: 将摘要概念用于竞态检测是有效的，能显著提高数据竞态检测能力。

Abstract: Sound static analysis can prove the absence of data races by establishing that no two conflicting memory accesses can occur at the same time. We repurpose the concept of digests -- summaries of computational histories originally introduced to bring tunable concurrency-sensitivity to thread-modular value analysis by abstract interpretation, extending this idea to race detection: We use digests to capture the conditions under which conflicting accesses may not happen in parallel. To formalize this, we give a definition of data races in the thread-modular local trace semantics and show how exclusion criteria for potential conflicts can be expressed as digests. We report on our implementation of digest-driven data race detection in the static analyzer Goblint, and evaluate it on the SV-COMP benchmark suite. Combining the lockset digest with digests reasoning on thread ids and thread joins increases the number of correctly solved tasks by more than a factor of five compared to lockset reasoning alone.

Motivation: 了解孟加拉国记者对生成式AI的认知、接受度、使用模式以及其媒体组织的立场，为非西方新闻业技术采纳研究做贡献。

Method: 对23名记者进行深度访谈。

Result: 孟加拉国记者虽机构支持有限且缺乏AI政策，但仍高度依赖GenAI；与西方对GenAI在新闻业影响的担忧大多相同；提出对UTAUT理论的两点修改。

Conclusion: 研究有助于理解情境因素如何塑造非西方新闻业的技术采纳轨迹。

Abstract: Newsrooms and journalists across the world are adopting Generative AI (GenAI). Drawing on in-depth interviews with 23 journalists, this study identifies Bangladeshi journalists' awareness, acceptance, usage patterns, and their media organizations' stance toward GenAI. This study finds Bangladeshi journalists' high reliance on GenAI like their Western colleagues despite limited institutional support and the near absence of AI policy. Despite this contrast, concerns over GenAI's implications in journalism between the West and non-West were mostly identical. Moreover, this study contributes to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by proposing two changes regarding GenAI adoption among journalists in non-Western settings. First, this study identifies the non-contribution of facilitating conditions in shaping behavioral intent in GenAI adoption in non-Western contexts. Second, social influence works in a horizontal order through informal peer pressure or professional motivation in the absence of formal institutional hierarchical pressure. Voluntariness in the context of Bangladeshi journalists is underpinned by their professional compulsion. Therefore, this study contributes to understanding how contextual factors shape technology adoption trajectories in non-Western journalism.

TL;DR: 论文对Spectral NSR框架进行三项语义增强，实验表明可提升推理系统性能，是更强大、可解释和可扩展的推理系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进Spectral NSR框架，提升其推理性能、泛化能力和降低推理噪声。

Method: 引入三项语义增强：基于Transformer的节点合并、句子级别的蕴含验证、与外部知识图谱对齐。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank和CLUTRR基准测试中准确率提升（最高+3.8%），对对抗情况泛化能力增强，推理噪声降低。

Conclusion: 通过模块化、语义预处理步骤增强Spectral NSR框架，不改变核心推理引擎，得到适用于开放领域和现实场景的推理系统。

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

Result: 在BIRD基准开发集上，记忆增强代理尤其是程序代理显著提高了准确率并减少了错误。

Conclusion: 将隐性人类专业知识转化为可复用知识很重要，为更具适应性、领域感知的文本到SQL系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate SQL queries from natural language questions but struggle with database-specific schemas and tacit domain knowledge. We introduce a framework for continual learning from human feedback in text-to-SQL, where a learning agent receives natural language feedback to refine queries and distills the revealed knowledge for reuse on future tasks. This distilled knowledge is stored in a structured memory, enabling the agent to improve execution accuracy over time. We design and evaluate multiple variations of a learning agent architecture that vary in how they capture and retrieve past experiences. Experiments on the BIRD benchmark Dev set show that memory-augmented agents, particularly the Procedural Agent, achieve significant accuracy gains and error reduction by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback. Our results highlight the importance of transforming tacit human expertise into reusable knowledge, paving the way for more adaptive, domain-aware text-to-SQL systems that continually learn from a human-in-the-loop.

Method: 提出Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET)策略，选择性微调预训练大语言模型最有效的层，冻结不太关键的层。

Result: 在金融NLP任务中表现出色，即使使用较小的大语言模型（约30亿参数）也能超越现有基准和GPT - 4等模型。

Conclusion: 该工作通过高效可扩展的模型，桥接了前沿金融NLP研究和实际部署。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Abstract: Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法可以为基于大语言模型的系统行为提供有用的不确定性量化。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text comprehension, but their ability to process complex, hierarchical tabular data remains underexplored. We present a novel approach to extracting structured data from multi-page government fiscal documents using LLM-based techniques. Applied to annual fiscal documents from the State of Karnataka in India (200+ pages), our method achieves high accuracy through a multi-stage pipeline that leverages domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation. A large challenge with traditional OCR methods is the inability to verify the accurate extraction of numbers. When applied to fiscal data, the inherent structure of fiscal tables, with totals at each level of the hierarchy, allows for robust internal validation of the extracted data. We use these hierarchical relationships to create multi-level validation checks. We demonstrate that LLMs can read tables and also process document-specific structural hierarchies, offering a scalable process for converting PDF-based fiscal disclosures into research-ready databases. Our implementation shows promise for broader applications across developing country contexts.

Result: 在七个文本分类基准测试中，该方法始终优于先前的演示选择策略。

Conclusion: 大语言模型性能与用于标签分布估计的小语言模型准确性呈正相关。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

Motivation: 探究TaLMs借助工具解决问题时，工具带来的能力提升是否反映了可靠推理。

Method: 以Code Interpreter工具为例，用PYMATH基准测试，开发多维评估套件，对比TaLMs和非工具模型。

Result: TaLMs最终答案准确率提升，但推理行为变差，工具使用越频繁推理越不连贯，错误类型转变，高风险情况中约55%存在TIM。

Conclusion: 提出基于偏好优化的框架，可在使用工具时提高最终答案准确率和推理深度。

Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use. Codes and data are available at: https://github.com/megagonlabs/TIM.

We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Abstract: Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can form hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering explicit errors. Traditional observability platforms fail to detect these costly inefficiencies. We present an unsupervised cycle detection framework that combines structural and semantic analysis. Our approach first applies computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to identify explicit loops and then leverages semantic similarity analysis to uncover subtle cycles characterized by redundant content generation. Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from a LangGraph-based stock market application, our hybrid approach achieves an F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28). While these results are encouraging, there remains substantial scope for improvement, and future work is needed to refine the approach and address its current limitations.

Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.

Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型在对话系统中体现历史人物时，简单检索生成响应浅薄、多阶段反思延迟过高的权衡问题。

Method: 通过离线数据增强和从结构化情景记忆中进行高效并行检索，将传记数据转化为带情感语义元数据的第一人称记忆，采用两阶段检索。

Result: 评估显示该方法在GPT - 4上与传统RAG相当，在小模型上显著优于传统RAG，结构化记忆可实现新颖可视化工具。

Conclusion: 该架构具有通用性，可为教育、博物馆和研究等需要准确高效的应用提供实用框架。

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

Conclusion: 本研究初步证明了将量子计算集成到大规模生成式语言模型的可行性。

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.

Conclusion: 所提出的PRO框架能有效解决大语言模型多目标对齐中手动指定偏好权重的问题。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

Result: 实验表明该方法无需微调即可提升文本压缩性能，能与任意自回归语言模型无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该方法是提升不同数据分布下文本压缩的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in high-resource languages like English, yet their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

Conclusion: 将语义一致性作为首要训练目标有价值，为构建更可靠守卫模型提供可扩展方案。

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

Conclusion: 需要全局层面的理解评估协议，倡导超越准确性的新框架来提升大语言模型的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

Conclusion: 所提方法具有有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Conclusion: 预注意力专家预测方法能实现准确且轻量级的专家预取，有效提升预测准确率。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently scale-up the model while keeping relatively low inference cost. As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer. Our lightweight, pre-attention expert routers achieve 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing about 15% improvement on absolute accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

Conclusion: AI能隐式学习和复制人类交流的心理细微差别，凸显其作为能够强化人类社会规范的社会参与者的新兴角色。

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

TL;DR: 研究对比情绪识别模型在AAVE和GAE上的表现，发现模型存在对AAVE愤怒情绪的高误判，凸显情绪AI强化种族刻板印象的安全问题，强调需文化和方言感知的情感计算系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情绪检测模型依赖反映主流文化规范的标注，难以识别训练数据分布外方言（如AAVE）的情绪表达，故研究模型在AAVE和GAE上的表现。

Method: 分析270万条洛杉矶地理标记推文，用计算近似方言特征为文本评分，收集875条高低AAVE密度推文的情绪标注，计算社区知情“银”标签，进行线性回归，关联普查区人口统计数据。

Result: GPT和基于BERT的模型对AAVE愤怒情绪的误判率比GAE高两倍多；SpanEmo模型对AAVE愤怒情绪误判率从GAE的25%增至60%；模型和非内群体标注与基于脏话的AAVE特征相关性高于内群体标注；非裔居民比例高的社区愤怒预测高、喜悦预测低。

Conclusion: 情绪AI通过有偏情绪分类强化种族刻板印象，需要开发文化和方言感知的情感计算系统。

Abstract: Automated emotion detection is widely used in applications ranging from well-being monitoring to high-stakes domains like mental health and hiring. However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed "silver" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems.

Conclusion: 提供了跨大语言模型族合并和转移专业技能的有效方法，减少冗余微调，增强模型适应性。

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

Conclusion: 揭示了影响负向偏差的多种因素，为缓解大语言模型的负向偏差提供关键见解。

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Conclusion: 利用文档内视图对可扩展和可泛化的专利理解有价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和方法能有效提升大语言模型在医疗问答中的性能，使其更好地适应专业领域需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

Result: 传统ML中数据增强的支持向量机表现最佳，准确率等达94%；RNN和BERT过拟合严重，RoBERTa后期也出现过拟合；大语言模型中OpenAI和Gemini表现最好，准确率约0.72 - 0.73。

Conclusion: 有限数据训练复杂深度模型有挑战，仔细的数据增强和简单算法对布鲁姆分类法分类有价值。

Abstract: This paper explores the automatic classification of exam questions and learning outcomes according to Bloom's Taxonomy. A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification.

Result: 深度迁移学习预测模型准确率达92.39%，敏感性91.22%，特异性93.56%，AUC为0.977，在各项指标上均优于传统机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 单个深度迁移学习预测模型可用于全球人工耳蜗项目儿童的语言预测。

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities across diverse domains, yet their performance on rare disease diagnosis from narrative medical cases remains underexplored. We introduce a novel dataset of 176 symptom-diagnosis pairs extracted from House M.D., a medical television series validated for teaching rare disease recognition in medical education. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT 4o mini, GPT 5 mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on narrative-based diagnostic reasoning tasks. Results show significant variation in performance, ranging from 16.48% to 38.64% accuracy, with newer model generations demonstrating a 2.3 times improvement. While all models face substantial challenges with rare disease diagnosis, the observed improvement across architectures suggests promising directions for future development. Our educationally validated benchmark establishes baseline performance metrics for narrative medical reasoning and provides a publicly accessible evaluation framework for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis research.

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.

Result: 在心脏特定语义检索任务中检索准确率达99.60%，比MedTE提高15.94个百分点；在MTEB医学基准测试中BIOSSES达到0.77 Spearman，SciFact达到0.61 NDCG@10。

Conclusion: 在综合临床教科书上进行领域专业化训练可实现近乎完美的心脏病学检索，性能优于MedTE。

Abstract: Biomedical text embeddings have primarily been developed using research literature from PubMed, yet clinical cardiology practice relies heavily on procedural knowledge and specialized terminology found in comprehensive textbooks rather than research abstracts. This research practice gap limits the effectiveness of existing embedding models for clinical applications incardiology. This study trained CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model based on Qwen3-Embedding-8B, using contrastive learning on a curated corpus of seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks totaling approximately 150,000 sentences after deduplication. The model employs InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives and achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific semantic retrieval tasks, a +15.94 percentage point improvement over MedTE, the current state-of-the-art medical embedding model. On MTEB medical benchmarks, the model obtained BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on related biomedical domains. Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60% Acc@1), improving over MedTE by +15.94 percentage points.

*Xingyu Ren,Youran Sun,Haoyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 发现文本嵌入模型输出有一致偏差，提出重归一化方法，实验表明该方法显著提升MMTEB上模型性能，且理论预测的变体效果经实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前文本嵌入模型输出存在一致偏差的问题。

Method: 提出重归一化（Renormalization）这一即插即用、无需训练且轻量级的解决方案，有两种变体。

Result: 在MMTEB上，重归一化显著提升现有模型性能，在38个模型上，检索任务提升9.7 $σ$，分类任务提升3.1 $σ$，其他任务提升0.8 $σ$，且理论预测的变体效果得到实验验证。

Conclusion: 重归一化方法能有效提升文本嵌入模型在MMTEB上的性能。

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本和少样本任务表现好，但对语言变体尤其是释义的鲁棒性研究不足，释义鲁棒性对可靠部署很重要，特别是在社会敏感场景。

Method: 引入Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM)指标，使用Social Counterfactuals数据集进行实证评估。

Result: 鲁棒性因释义策略而异，男女相关查询存在细微但一致的差异。

Conclusion: 探讨了释义鲁棒性与性别之间的相互作用，以及对多模态系统公平和公平部署的影响。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is a widely used multimodal model that aligns text and image representations through large-scale training. While it performs strongly on zero-shot and few-shot tasks, its robustness to linguistic variation, particularly paraphrasing, remains underexplored. Paraphrase robustness is essential for reliable deployment, especially in socially sensitive contexts where inconsistent representations can amplify demographic biases. In this paper, we introduce the Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM), a novel measure for quantifying CLIP's sensitivity to paraphrased queries. Using the Social Counterfactuals dataset, a benchmark designed to reveal social and demographic biases, we empirically assess CLIP's stability under paraphrastic variation, examine the interaction between paraphrase robustness and gender, and discuss implications for fairness and equitable deployment of multimodal systems. Our analysis reveals that robustness varies across paraphrasing strategies, with subtle yet consistent differences observed between male- and female-associated queries.

TL;DR: 提出多模态对话框架AV - Dialog，结合视听线索，实验显示其在干扰下优于仅音频模型，提升对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对话模型在嘈杂多说话者环境中表现不佳，产生无关回复和不自然话轮转换的问题。

Method: 提出AV - Dialog框架，结合声学标记化，在多种视听对话数据集上进行多任务、多阶段训练。

Result: AV - Dialog在干扰下优于仅音频模型，减少转录错误，改善话轮转换预测，提升人类评价的对话质量。

Conclusion: 视听结合对说话者感知交互很有作用，为现实嘈杂环境中稳健的对话代理铺平道路。

Abstract: Dialogue models falter in noisy, multi-speaker environments, often producing irrelevant responses and awkward turn-taking. We present AV-Dialog, the first multimodal dialog framework that uses both audio and visual cues to track the target speaker, predict turn-taking, and generate coherent responses. By combining acoustic tokenization with multi-task, multi-stage training on monadic, synthetic, and real audio-visual dialogue datasets, AV-Dialog achieves robust streaming transcription, semantically grounded turn-boundary detection and accurate responses, resulting in a natural conversational flow. Experiments show that AV-Dialog outperforms audio-only models under interference, reducing transcription errors, improving turn-taking prediction, and enhancing human-rated dialogue quality. These results highlight the power of seeing as well as hearing for speaker-aware interaction, paving the way for {spoken} dialogue agents that perform {robustly} in real-world, noisy environments.

Result: 实验表明该混合方法能高效生成高质量问答对。

Conclusion: 该混合方法结合了可扩展性、流畅性和语言精确性。

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

*Wei Fan,JinYi Yoon,Bo Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出智能多智能体辩论框架iMAD，选择性触发辩论，减少令牌使用并提高答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体辩论框架触发辩论效率低、成本高且可能降低准确性，需改进。

Method: 先让单个智能体生成结构化自我批判响应，提取41个特征，用轻量级辩论决策分类器和提出的FocusCal损失函数决定是否触发辩论。

Result: 通过六个（视觉）问答数据集实验，iMAD最多减少92%令牌使用，最多提高13.5%答案准确性。

Conclusion: iMAD是一种高效的框架，能在减少计算成本的同时提高答案准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

Result: 定量评估显示NOVA优于编码代理基线，案例研究展示其发现潜力。

Conclusion: NOVA具有可扩展的发现潜力，能解决数字化病理分析的问题。

Abstract: Digitized histopathology analysis involves complex, time-intensive workflows and specialized expertise, limiting its accessibility. We introduce NOVA, an agentic framework that translates scientific queries into executable analysis pipelines by iteratively generating and running Python code. NOVA integrates 49 domain-specific tools (e.g., nuclei segmentation, whole-slide encoding) built on open-source software, and can also create new tools ad hoc. To evaluate such systems, we present SlideQuest, a 90-question benchmark -- verified by pathologists and biomedical scientists -- spanning data processing, quantitative analysis, and hypothesis testing. Unlike prior biomedical benchmarks focused on knowledge recall or diagnostic QA, SlideQuest demands multi-step reasoning, iterative coding, and computational problem solving. Quantitative evaluation shows NOVA outperforms coding-agent baselines, and a pathologist-verified case study links morphology to prognostically relevant PAM50 subtypes, demonstrating its scalable discovery potential.

Abstract: The generation of highly fluent text by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to information integrity and academic research. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) shared task, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, particularly in news articles and academic writing. M-DAIGT comprises two binary classification subtasks: News Article Detection (NAD) (Subtask 1) and Academic Writing Detection (AWD) (Subtask 2). To support this task, we developed and released a new large-scale benchmark dataset of 30,000 samples, balanced between human-written and AI-generated texts. The AI-generated content was produced using a variety of modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and diverse prompting strategies. A total of 46 unique teams registered for the shared task, of which four teams submitted final results. All four teams participated in both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2. We describe the methods employed by these participating teams and briefly discuss future directions for M-DAIGT.

Motivation: 探究政府以现代化之名对司法的攻击如何破坏司法独立。

Method: 采用混合合成控制和双重差分方法，对比委内瑞拉与无激进宪法变革的稳定国家。

Result: 发现威权干预导致司法独立立即且持久崩溃，结果稳健。

Conclusion: 政府对司法的攻击会造成司法独立的破坏。

Abstract: We investigate how government-orchestrated assaults on the judiciary, disguised as modernization efforts, undermine judicial independence. Our study focuses on Venezuela's constitutional overhaul in the early 2000s, initiated by Hugo Chávez and implemented through a judicial emergency committee. We employ a hybrid synthetic control and difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of populist attacks on judicial independence trajectories. By comparing Venezuela to a stable pool of countries without radical constitutional changes, our identification strategy isolates the effect of populist assaults from unobservable confounders and common time trends. Our findings reveal that authoritarian interventions lead to an immediate and lasting breakdown of judicial independence. The deterioration in judicial independence vis-á-vis the estimated counterfactual is robust to variations in the donor pool composition. It does not appear to be driven by pre-existing judicial changes and withstands numerous temporal and spatial placebo checks across over nine million randomly sequenced donor samples.

Result: 发现环境规制可通过挤入和挤出效应影响城市人口流动。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Since the Industrial Revolution, the world economy has experienced rapid development, and China's economy has also achieved an unprecedented takeoff in the past. Behind the economic growth, population surge, and continuous improvement of people's living standards lies the enormous consumption of fossil energy and environmental pollution. This kind of pollution has caused irreparable damage to the world. The most concerned environmental issue globally at present is the global warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions. China is in a stage of rapid development, and as the largest developing country, China's development path has a significant impact on global climate change. At the same time, the global community also puts pressure on China to limit carbon dioxide emissions. To address energy shortages and environmental issues, countries around the world have introduced corresponding energy and environmental regulations. Due to different culture and government systems, the effects of energy and environmental regulations in various countries are also different. Therefore, it is still necessary to discuss China's energy and environmental regulations.This paper uses data from prefecture-level cities between 2003 and 2008 to discuss the impact of the "Eleventh Five-Year Plan" environmental regulations on urbanization rates. It first provides a theoretical analysis of the relationship between environmental regulation and urbanization, finding that environmental regulation can influence urban population mobility through both crowding-in and crowding-out effects.

Conclusion: 汇丰银行早期历史不光彩，虽有成功因素，但不应忽视其污点，其未道歉的行为值得关注，分析成功原因对企业家有借鉴意义。

Abstract: Europe's largest bank by assets as of 2025 started out in the 1860s in one of Europe's colonies: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Co (HSBC). Multiple wars forced Qing China and later the young Republic of China into a series of unequal treaties, one of which was the forced legalisation of the opium trade from parts of the British Empire into China, another was opening several cities, including Shanghai, for trade and granting extensive civil, property and business rights to non-residents and yet another was the annexation of Hong Kong by the United Kingdom. These are the conditions that created HSBC and in which it thrived, including from opium-related profits. During periods of relative calm, the bank grew geographically and made profits -- whether in moral or unethical, whether in legal or unlawful ways -- which helped HSBC weather the storms of civil and world wars. Other aspects contributed to HSBC's survival and success, such as its global nature, which allowed it to diversify and shift away from regions when danger emerges there and find shelter in safer havens. Yet the resilient survival abilities and the financial success of HSBC until 1950 should not distract from the fact that in addition to its tainted cradle and early profits from facilitating the poisoning of a whole society, its human resource system was also discrimination based, attempting to divide the one human race into different groups -- in spite of such practises being opposed to medical and biological facts. What is particularly interesting to see is that not only has HSBC yet to apologise for the early drug-related blood money it made: it even fails to mention its colonial, drug profits tainted past on any of its many history-themed pages sighted. Later sections contain possible reasons for HSBC's resilience and success, particularly interesting for entrepreneurs.

Motivation: 传统美国住房市场有季节性规律，新冠疫情后情况变化，需研究是否有模式转变。

Method: 使用联邦住房金融局和美国人口普查局的住房价格指数、库存和销售数据，通过X - 13 - ARIMA程序提取季节性成分，用统计测试评估区域差异。

Result: 确认价格和成交量有季节性波动，近期峰值提前到3 - 4月，季节性效应放大，区域差异与气候和市场结构有关，价格和成交量同相变动。

Conclusion: 研究结果对政策制定者、房地产经纪人和投资者应对疫情后市场动态有重要启示，有助于了解市场活动时机和解读。

Abstract: Seasonality has traditionally shaped the U.S. housing market, with activity peaking in spring-summer and declining in autumn-winter. However, recent disruptions, particularly post-COVID-19, raise questions about shift in these patterns. This study analyzes housing market date (1991-2024) to examine evolving seasonality and regional heterogeneity. Using Housing Price Index (HPI), inventory and sales data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency and U.S. Census Bureau, seasonal components are extracted via the X-13-ARIMA procedure, and statistical tests assess variations across regions. The results confirm seasonal fluctuations in prices and volumes, with recent shifts toward earlier annual peak (March-April) and amplified seasonal effects. Regional variations align with differences in climate and market structure, while prices and sales volumes exhibit in-phase movement, suggesting thick-market momentum behaviour. These findings highlight key implications for policymakers, realtors and investors navigating post-pandemic market dynamics, offering insights into the timing and interpretation of housing market activities.

Motivation: 探究AI使用与员工心理健康、工作乐趣和身心健康安全等福祉结果之间的关系。

Method: 使用来自经合组织对七个国家的人工智能调查的微观数据进行研究。

Result: AI使用者在三个福祉结果上显著更易有改善，效果在8.9%到21.3%之间；不同代际和性别受益不同，如千禧一代受益最明显，Z世代仅在工作乐趣上受益，女性心理健康改善更明显，男性身体健康改善更明显。

Conclusion: AI对职场的影响不均衡，受人口因素、职业阶段和工作角色性质影响。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between AI use and worker well-being outcomes such as mental health, job enjoyment, and physical health and safety, using microdata from the OECD AI Surveys across seven countries. The results reveal that AI users are significantly more likely to report improvements across all three outcomes, with effects ranging from 8.9% to 21.3%. However, these benefits vary by generation and gender. Generation Y (1981-1996) shows the strongest gains across all dimensions, while Generation X (1965-1980) reports moderate improvements in mental health and job enjoyment. In contrast, Generation Z (1997-2012) benefits only in job enjoyment. As digital natives already familiar with technology, Gen Z workers may not receive additional gains in mental or physical health from AI, though they still experience increased enjoyment from using it. Baby Boomers (born before 1965) experience limited benefits, as they may not find these tools as engaging or useful. Women report stronger mental health gains, whereas men report greater improvements in physical health. These findings suggest that AI's workplace impact is uneven and shaped by demographic factors, career stage, and the nature of workers' roles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究政治家在负面媒体报道时是策略性转移话题（战略转移）还是始终保持挑衅性沟通（永远的马戏团），以了解政治“马戏团”是否会破坏民主问责制。

Method: 对特朗普在2025年爱泼斯坦事件曝光期间的Truth Social帖子进行计算文本分析。

Result: 丑闻报道增加一个标准差，在4天内沟通模式与基线的偏差为0.28个标准差，结果对时间安慰剂和证伪测试稳健。

Conclusion: 虽未正式确定因果关系，但结果表明领导人可能在自己的友好媒体生态中使用转移注意力的沟通方式，这对两极分化民主国家的问责制有影响。

Abstract: Political "circuses" may undermine democratic accountability if leaders facing scandal can reliably pull media coverage toward fresh topics and away from substantive investigations or evaluations. We investigate whether politicians strategically alter their messaging during damaging media coverage ("strategic diversion") or maintain consistent provocative communication regardless of scandal coverage ("always-on circus"). Using computational text analysis of Donald Trump's Truth Social posts during the 2025 Epstein revelations, we find that a one-standard-deviation increase in scandal coverage is associated with communication patterns that deviate from baseline by 0.28 standard deviations over a 4-day window. Although these findings do not provide formal causal identification, they are robust to timing placebos and falsification tests, are consistent with the interpretation that leaders may deploy diversionary communication specifically within their own friendly media ecosystem, which has implications for accountability in polarized democracies.

Method: 提出CLIPPan框架，先微调CLIP使其适应泛锐化任务，再构建融合语义语言约束的损失函数，用语言作监督信号引导融合学习。

Result: CLIPPan在真实数据集上提升了不同泛锐化骨干网络的光谱和空间保真度。

Conclusion: CLIPPan为无监督全分辨率泛锐化设定了新的技术水平。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in supervised pansharpening neural networks, these methods face domain adaptation challenges of resolution due to the intrinsic disparity between simulated reduced-resolution training data and real-world full-resolution scenarios.To bridge this gap, we propose an unsupervised pansharpening framework, CLIPPan, that enables model training at full resolution directly by taking CLIP, a visual-language model, as a supervisor. However, directly applying CLIP to supervise pansharpening remains challenging due to its inherent bias toward natural images and limited understanding of pansharpening tasks. Therefore, we first introduce a lightweight fine-tuning pipeline that adapts CLIP to recognize low-resolution multispectral, panchromatic, and high-resolution multispectral images, as well as to understand the pansharpening process. Then, building on the adapted CLIP, we formulate a novel \textit{loss integrating semantic language constraints}, which aligns image-level fusion transitions with protocol-aligned textual prompts (e.g., Wald's or Khan's descriptions), thus enabling CLIPPan to use language as a powerful supervisory signal and guide fusion learning without ground truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLIPPan consistently improves spectral and spatial fidelity across various pansharpening backbones on real-world datasets, setting a new state of the art for unsupervised full-resolution pansharpening.

Result: 成功实现跨模态对齐，病变分割主要受益于保留细粒度特定模态特征。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有一定效果，公开了模型检查点和代码。

Abstract: The field of computer vision is undergoing a paradigm shift toward large-scale foundation model pre-training via self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging large volumes of unlabeled brain MRI data, such models can learn anatomical priors that improve few-shot performance in diverse neuroimaging tasks. However, most SSL frameworks are tailored to natural images, and their adaptation to capture multi-modal MRI information remains underexplored. This work proposes a modality-invariant representation learning setup and evaluates its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation, following large-scale pre-training. Experimental results suggest that despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features. Model checkpoints and code are made publicly available.

Result: 总结出当前方法的常见局限性和关键挑战。

Conclusion: 建议研究多模态深度学习模型，为抵御有害合成媒体提供更强防御。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Short-Window Sliding Learning framework for real-time violence detection in CCTV footages. Unlike conventional long-video training approaches, the proposed method divides videos into 1-2 second clips and applies Large Language Model (LLM)-based auto-caption labeling to construct fine-grained datasets. Each short clip fully utilizes all frames to preserve temporal continuity, enabling precise recognition of rapid violent events.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition plays a key role in many domains, including mental health monitoring, educational interaction, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.

Abstract: This paper proposes a competitive and computationally efficient approach to probabilistic rainfall nowcasting. A video projector (V-JEPA Vision Transformer) associated to a lightweight probabilistic head is attached to a pre-trained satellite vision encoder (DINOv3\text{-}SAT493M) to map encoder tokens into a discrete empirical CDF (eCDF) over 4-hour accumulated rainfall. The projector-head is optimized end-to-end over the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). As an alternative, 3D-UNET baselines trained with an aggregate Rank Probability Score and a per-pixel Gamma-Hurdle objective are used. On the Weather4Cast 2025 benchmark, the proposed method achieved a promising performance, with a CRPS of 3.5102 (CRPS), which represents $\approx$26\% in effectiveness gain against the best 3D-UNET.

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

Result: TG - DFER在弱监督下实现了更好的泛化性、可解释性和时间敏感性。

Conclusion: TG - DFER能有效解决DFER问题，有较好性能。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，在匹配的令牌预算下有一致改进，计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: PAS为视频大语言模型的鲁棒时间编码提供了即插即用的升级方案。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

Motivation: 为零样本视觉提出一个有效的工作流，利用现有的视觉语言模型。

Method: 工作流包含量化（将开放式查询转为选择题）和二值化（对每个候选答案问真假问题并确定答案）两个步骤。

Result: 在多个任务上评估，量化成选择题有大幅提升，二值化进一步提高性能，同一工作流在各任务都有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该工作流简单统一，强调推理时间设计而非特定任务训练，为现有视觉语言模型实现更强零样本视觉提供实用途径。

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

Result: 在多种视觉基准测试中，VisMem相对原始模型平均性能提升11.8%，优于所有对比模型。

Conclusion: VisMem为潜在空间记忆增强建立了新范式。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

Conclusion: PROMISE框架能有效解决模态缺失情况下跨模态表示问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

Conclusion: AirCopBench可有效评估多模态大语言模型在具身空中协作感知的能力，且模拟到真实转移在该领域可行。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Result: 模型能以较高准确率（AUC约0.67 - 0.68）从正常胸部X光片预测患者医保类型，信号分散在胸上部和中部，即使控制变量或单一种族训练仍可检测到。

Conclusion: 医学影像并非中立生物数据，医学AI公平性目标应是审视和分离临床数据中的社会指纹。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Conclusion: PINGS - X有效解决了4D流MRI数据超分辨率的训练时间和精度问题。

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.

Motivation: 强化微调在大语言模型推理能力提升有成果，但扩展到大型视频语言模型有挑战，需提升其视频推理能力。

Method: 提出VideoP2R框架，SFT阶段开发三步流程生成高质量数据集，RL阶段引入PA - GRPO算法。

Result: VideoP2R在七个视频推理和理解基准测试中的六个达到SotA性能。

Conclusion: 过程感知建模和PA - GRPO有效，模型感知输出对下游推理信息充足。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散Transformer视频生成方法有二次注意力复杂度问题，现有加速方法有缺陷。

Method: 引入LiteAttention方法，利用时间连贯性进行进化计算跳过，结合动态方法适应性与静态方法效率。

Result: 在生产视频扩散模型上实现显著加速，且质量无下降。

Conclusion: 该方法有效可行，代码和实现细节将公开。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Conclusion: AlignVQA框架和aligncal损失函数能有效解决VQA系统置信度校准问题。

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

Conclusion: 当前VLMs存在根本脆弱性，需要超越对抗性扰动进行鲁棒性评估，关注模型应可靠保持的不变性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Conclusion: S2D - Align为提升复杂多模态生成任务的接地能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

Motivation: DDIB方法存在翻译效率低和潜在分布不匹配导致的翻译轨迹偏差问题，需要改进。

Method: 计算从源域到目标域潜在分布的OT映射，用映射后的分布作为目标域反向扩散过程的起点。

Result: 在三个高分辨率数据集的四个翻译任务实验中，相比基线模型，采样效率提高20.29%，平均FID分数降低2.6。

Conclusion: OT - ALD消除了潜在分布不匹配问题，有效平衡了图像翻译速度和质量。

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

Method: 提出BOFA框架，在CLIP现有跨模态桥接层进行适配，利用正交低秩融合防止遗忘，采用跨模态混合原型提升分类性能。

Result: 在标准基准测试上，BOFA相比现有方法实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: BOFA框架能有效解决CLIP应用于类增量学习的问题，实现稳定知识积累和更好的分类性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Abstract: Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move

TL;DR: 提出D - GAP方法改善计算机视觉应用的OOD鲁棒性，实验显示其优于通用和特定数据集增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实计算机视觉应用中OOD鲁棒性难实现，通用增强效果不稳定，特定数据集增强需专业知识，且神经网络对域偏移适应差，扰动频率值忽略像素细节。

Method: 提出D - GAP，在幅度空间（频率空间）和像素空间进行有针对性增强，从任务梯度计算频率空间敏感度图，自适应插值幅度，同时进行像素空间混合。

Result: 在四个真实数据集和三个域适应基准上实验，D - GAP始终优于通用和特定数据集增强方法，在真实数据集上平均OOD性能提高5.3%，在基准数据集上提高1.8%。

Conclusion: D - GAP能有效提高OOD鲁棒性，表现优于现有增强方法。

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

Result: AUVIC达到了最先进的目标遗忘率，对非目标概念的性能退化最小。

Conclusion: AUVIC能有效解决多模态大语言模型视觉概念遗忘问题，在移除目标概念时避免对相关实体的影响。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值在于对文化知识的转换和重新语境化，应推动评估向更丰富的上下文理解发展。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

TL;DR: 研究视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）对看似合理却无法回答问题的鲁棒性，提出VRD - UQA基准进行评估，揭示VLLMs局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLLMs在多页视觉丰富文档（VRDs）的视觉问答（VQA）中表现出色，但检测无法回答问题的能力是待研究问题。

Method: 提出VRD - UQA基准，自动修改现有VQA数据集问题，用VLLM作为评判方法验证问题不可答性，在12个模型上进行实验。

Result: 分析了VLLMs在页面和文档级别检测不可答问题的准确性、不同类型损坏的影响、不同知识注入策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 揭示了VLLMs的局限性，VRD - UQA可作为开发有弹性的文档VQA系统的评估框架。

Abstract: The evolution of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) has revolutionized the automatic understanding of Visually Rich Documents (VRDs), which contain both textual and visual elements. Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability). Our findings reveal VLLMs' limitations and demonstrate that VRD-UQA can serve as an evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems.

Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像模型生成图像时的随机和不一致问题，以及现有解决方法存在的效率和开销问题。

Method: 引入免训练统一多模态代理ImAgent，通过策略控制器引导多个生成动作动态交互和自组织。

Result: 在图像生成和编辑任务的大量实验中，ImAgent始终优于骨干模型，在骨干模型失败处也能超越其他强基线。

Conclusion: 统一多模态代理在测试时扩展的自适应和高效图像生成方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.

Motivation: 解决大视觉语言模型因对象幻觉导致的不可靠问题。

Method: 通过计算图像与预测对象在前置标记条件下的互信息量化模型行为，引入基于前置标记注意力权重的PAS指标。

Result: PAS指标在多模型和数据集上实现了最先进的对象幻觉检测，可实时过滤和干预。

Conclusion: PAS指标作为轻量级、免训练的信号，能有效检测对象幻觉。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

Motivation: 解决从GRIN下载馆藏时遇到的速率限制和元数据碎片化问题，帮助图书馆更好利用Google Books馆藏。

Method: 开发开源且可用于生产的Python管道GRIN Transfer，更新Institutional Books 1.0管道以适配GRIN Transfer输出格式。

Result: 创建了GRIN Transfer和更新后的Institutional Books 1.0管道，可组成端到端处理流程。

Conclusion: GRIN Transfer针对不同环境优化了可靠性和可用性，报告还给出不同用例的配置指导。

Abstract: Publicly launched in 2004, the Google Books project has scanned tens of millions of items in partnership with libraries around the world. As part of this project, Google created the Google Return Interface (GRIN). Through this platform, libraries can access their scanned collections, the associated metadata, and the ongoing OCR and metadata improvements that become available as Google reprocesses these collections using new technologies. When downloading the Harvard Library Google Books collection from GRIN to develop the Institutional Books dataset, we encountered several challenges related to rate-limiting and atomized metadata within the GRIN platform. To overcome these challenges and help other libraries make more robust use of their Google Books collections, this technical report introduces the initial release of GRIN Transfer. This open-source and production-ready Python pipeline allows partner libraries to efficiently retrieve their Google Books collections from GRIN. This report also introduces an updated version of our Institutional Books 1.0 pipeline, initially used to analyze, augment, and assemble the Institutional Books 1.0 dataset. We have revised this pipeline for compatibility with the output format of GRIN Transfer. A library could pair these two tools to create an end-to-end processing pipeline for their Google Books collection to retrieve, structure, and enhance data available from GRIN. This report gives an overview of how GRIN Transfer was designed to optimize for reliability and usability in different environments, as well as guidance on configuration for various use cases.

Motivation: 进一步发展条件独立均衡的代数几何基础，将图形模型的条件独立关系融入战略推理。

Method: 扩展二元博弈的早期工作，分析任意格式通用博弈的相关Spohn CI簇结构，引入Nash CI簇并研究其性质。

Result: 通用博弈中Spohn CI簇要么为空，要么余维等于参数化无向图模型中玩家策略维度之和减去玩家数量；非空时，完全混合CI均衡集构成光滑流形；证明Nash CI簇的不可约性，描述其定义方程、次数和完全混合CI均衡存在条件。

Conclusion: 对条件独立均衡的代数几何基础有了更深入的研究成果，为相关博弈论研究提供基础。

Abstract: This paper further develops the algebraic--geometric foundations of conditional independence (CI) equilibria, a refinement of dependency equilibria that integrates conditional independence relations from graphical models into strategic reasoning and thereby subsumes Nash equilibria. Extending earlier work on binary games, we analyze the structure of the associated Spohn CI varieties for generic games of arbitrary format. We show that for generic games the Spohn CI variety is either empty or has codimension equal to the sum of the players' strategy dimensions minus the number of players in the parametrized undirected graphical model. When non-empty, the set of totally mixed CI equilibria forms a smooth manifold for generic games. For cluster graphical models, we introduce the class of Nash CI varieties, prove their irreducibility, and describe their defining equations, degrees, and conditions for the existence of totally mixed CI equilibria for generic games.

Result: 在三天黑客马拉松研究中，16名开发者无论有无经验，都能快速构建多样化且功能齐全的支持代理的Web应用程序。

Conclusion: 该工作为实现代理网络提供基础机制，能实现网络上人机无缝安全协作。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of autonomous AI agents on the web is hampered by a fundamental misalignment: agents must infer affordances from human-oriented user interfaces, leading to brittle, inefficient, and insecure interactions. To address this, we introduce VOIX, a web-native framework that enables websites to expose reliable, auditable, and privacy-preserving capabilities for AI agents through simple, declarative HTML elements. VOIX introduces <tool> and <context> tags, allowing developers to explicitly define available actions and relevant state, thereby creating a clear, machine-readable contract for agent behavior. This approach shifts control to the website developer while preserving user privacy by disconnecting the conversational interactions from the website. We evaluated the framework's practicality, learnability, and expressiveness in a three-day hackathon study with 16 developers. The results demonstrate that participants, regardless of prior experience, were able to rapidly build diverse and functional agent-enabled web applications. Ultimately, this work provides a foundational mechanism for realizing the Agentic Web, enabling a future of seamless and secure human-AI collaboration on the web.

We present Symbiotik, an intelligent, context-aware adaptive visualization system that leverages neurophysiological signals to estimate mental workload (MWL) and dynamically adapt visual dashboards using reinforcement learning (RL). Through a user study with 120 participants and three visualization types, we demonstrate that our approach improves task performance and engagement. Symbiotik offers a scalable, real-time adaptation architecture, and a validated methodology for neuroadaptive user interfaces.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We give explicit low-rank bilinear non-commutative schemes for multiplying structured $n \times n$ matrices with $2 \leq n \leq 5$, which serve as building blocks for recursive algorithms with improved multiplicative factors in asymptotic complexity. Our schemes are discovered over $\mathbb{F}_2$ or $\mathbb{F}_3$ and lifted to $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Q}$. Using a flip graph search over tensor decompositions, we derive schemes for general, upper-triangular, lower-triangular, symmetric, and skew-symmetric inputs, as well as products of a structured matrix with its transpose. In particular, we obtain $4 \times 4$ rank-34 schemes: (i) multiplying a general matrix by its transpose using 10 recursive calls, improving the factor from 26/41 (0.634) to 8/13 (0.615); and (ii) multiplying an upper-triangular matrix by a general matrix using 12 recursive calls, improving the factor from 8/13 (0.615) to 22/37 (0.595). Additionally, using $\mathbb{F}_3$ flip graphs, we discover schemes over $\mathbb{Q}$ that fundamentally require the inverse of 2, including a $2 \times 2$ symmetric-symmetric multiplication of rank 5 and a $3 \times 3$ skew-symmetric-general multiplication of rank 14 (improving upon AlphaTensor's 15).

Result: 模型应用于MNIST数字分类，重现了感知决策的关键实证特征，如随机变异性、右偏响应时间分布等。

Conclusion: 该模型是一种有原则且图像可计算的感知决策模型，能生成逐次试验的选择和响应时间模式。

Abstract: Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.

Method: 提出随机EP框架，将概率脉冲神经元集成到EP范式，并提供理论保证其在平均场理论下近似确定性EP。

Result: 该框架在视觉基准测试中缩小与BPTT训练的SNN和EP训练的非脉冲CRNN的差距，同时保留局部性。

Conclusion: 随机EP是神经形态和片上学习的有前途方向。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient, sparse, biologically inspired computation. Training them with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and surrogate gradients achieves strong performance but remains biologically implausible. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) provides a more local and biologically grounded alternative. However, existing EP frameworks, primarily based on deterministic neurons, either require complex mechanisms to handle discontinuities in spiking dynamics or fail to scale beyond simple visual tasks. Inspired by the stochastic nature of biological spiking mechanism and recent hardware trends, we propose a stochastic EP framework that integrates probabilistic spiking neurons into the EP paradigm. This formulation smoothens the optimization landscape, stabilizes training, and enables scalable learning in deep convolutional spiking convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the proposed stochastic EP dynamics approximate deterministic EP under mean-field theory, thereby inheriting its underlying theoretical guarantees. The proposed framework narrows the gap to both BPTT-trained SNNs and EP-trained non-spiking CRNNs in vision benchmarks while preserving locality, highlighting stochastic EP as a promising direction for neuromorphic and on-chip learning.

Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technologies are transforming manufacturing by enabling real-time prediction, monitoring, and control of complex processes. Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.

Conclusion: 为大语言模型多智能体训练提供从全局评估到局部监督的统一可审计途径，给出理论基础和训练信号，待实证验证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise for complex tasks, yet current training methods lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent-level and message-level learning. We propose a theoretical framework that unifies cooperative game-theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform system evaluation into agent credit and then into response-level signals. Unlike prior approaches that rely only on attribution (e.g., Shapley) or step-level labels (e.g., PRM), our method produces local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. In success cases, Shapley-based credit assignment fairly allocates outcomes across agents and is refined into per-message rewards that promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage. In failure cases, first-error localization yields repair-aware preferences that penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts. The resulting signals are bounded, cooperative, and directly compatible with reinforcement-based or preference-based post-training, providing a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training. Our contribution is conceptual: we present a theoretical foundation and training signals, leaving empirical validation for future work.

Conclusion: 多智能体系统需要进行安全感知设计。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS). As these systems move toward real-world applications, their security becomes paramount. Existing research largely evaluates single-agent security, leaving a critical gap in understanding the vulnerabilities introduced by multi-agent design. However, existing systems fall short due to lack of unified frameworks and metrics focusing on unique rejection modes in MAS. We present SafeAgents, a unified and extensible framework for fine-grained security assessment of MAS. SafeAgents systematically exposes how design choices such as plan construction strategies, inter-agent context sharing, and fallback behaviors affect susceptibility to adversarial prompting. We introduce Dharma, a diagnostic measure that helps identify weak links within multi-agent pipelines. Using SafeAgents, we conduct a comprehensive study across five widely adopted multi-agent architectures (centralized, decentralized, and hybrid variants) on four datasets spanning web tasks, tool use, and code generation. Our findings reveal that common design patterns carry significant vulnerabilities. For example, centralized systems that delegate only atomic instructions to sub-agents obscure harmful objectives, reducing robustness. Our results highlight the need for security-aware design in MAS.

Conclusion: 这些发现弥合了渐近效率性质和有限样本分布外泛化界，为DR协变量偏移适应提供了全面理论基础。

Abstract: Distribution shift between the training domain and the test domain poses a key challenge for modern machine learning. An extensively studied instance is the \emph{covariate shift}, where the marginal distribution of covariates differs across domains, while the conditional distribution of outcome remains the same. The doubly-robust (DR) estimator, recently introduced by \cite{kato2023double}, combines the density ratio estimation with a pilot regression model and demonstrates asymptotic normality and $\sqrt{n}$-consistency, even when the pilot estimates converge slowly. However, the prior arts has focused exclusively on deriving asymptotic results and has left open the question of non-asymptotic guarantees for the DR estimator.
  This paper establishes the first non-asymptotic learning bounds for the DR covariate shift adaptation. Our main contributions are two-fold: (\romannumeral 1) We establish \emph{structure-agnostic} high-probability upper bounds on the excess target risk of the DR estimator that depend only on the $L^2$-errors of the pilot estimates and the Rademacher complexity of the model class, without assuming specific procedures to obtain the pilot estimate, and (\romannumeral 2) under \emph{well-specified parameterized models}, we analyze the DR covariate shift adaptation based on modern techniques for non-asymptotic analysis of MLE, whose key terms governed by the Fisher information mismatch term between the source and target distributions. Together, these findings bridge asymptotic efficiency properties and a finite-sample out-of-distribution generalization bounds, providing a comprehensive theoretical underpinnings for the DR covariate shift adaptation.

Result: 大规模验证表明MMA - Sim与真实硬件位等价。

Conclusion: 利用MMA - Sim可研究影响DNN训练稳定性的算术行为，识别可能导致重大误差的未公开行为。

Abstract: The rapidly growing computation demands of deep neural networks (DNNs) have driven hardware vendors to integrate matrix multiplication accelerators (MMAs), such as NVIDIA Tensor Cores and AMD Matrix Cores, into modern GPUs. However, due to distinct and undocumented arithmetic specifications for floating-point matrix multiplication, some MMAs can lead to numerical imprecision and inconsistency that can compromise the stability and reproducibility of DNN training and inference.
  This paper presents MMA-Sim, the first bit-accurate reference model that reveals the detailed arithmetic behaviors of the MMAs from ten GPU architectures (eight from NVIDIA and two from AMD). By dissecting the MMAs using a combination of targeted and randomized tests, our methodology derives nine arithmetic algorithms to simulate the floating-point matrix multiplication of the MMAs. Large-scale validation confirms bitwise equivalence between MMA-Sim and the real hardware. Using MMA-Sim, we investigate arithmetic behaviors that affect DNN training stability, and identify undocumented behaviors that could lead to significant errors.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种在一位压缩感知中支持恢复的方案，实现次线性运行时间，分别在通用精确/近似支持恢复和概率精确支持恢复上有改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有一位压缩感知中支持恢复工作运行时间为Ω(n)，本文旨在提出次线性o(n)运行时间的方案。

Method: 提出两种方案，一是用于通用精确/近似支持恢复，二是用于概率精确支持恢复。

Result: 通用精确支持恢复方案测量次数m=O(k^2log(n/k)log n)，运行时间D=O(km)；通用ε - 近似支持恢复方案m=O(kε^(-1)log(n/k)log n)，D=O(ε^(-1)m)；概率精确支持恢复方案m=O(k(log k)/(log log k)log n)，运行时间O(m)，误差概率趋近于零。

Conclusion: 提出的方案显著改善了一位压缩感知中支持恢复的运行时间。

Abstract: The problem of support recovery in one-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) aim to recover the support of a signal $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, denoted as supp$(x)$, from the observation $y=\text{sign}(Ax)$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a sensing matrix and $|\text{supp}(x)|\leq k, k \ll n$. Under this setting, most preexisting works have a recovery runtime $Ω(n)$. In this paper, we propose two schemes that have sublinear $o(n)$ runtime. (1.i): For the universal exact support recovery, a scheme of $m=O(k^2\log(n/k)\log n)$ measurements and runtime $D=O(km)$. (1.ii): For the universal $ε$-approximate support recovery, the same scheme with $m=O(kε^{-1}\log(n/k)\log n)$ and runtime $D=O(ε^{-1}m)$, improving the runtime significantly with an extra $O(\log n)$ factor in the number of measurements compared to the current optimal (Matsumoto et al., 2023). (2): For the probabilistic exact support recovery in the sublinear regime, a scheme of $m:=O(k\frac{\log k}{\log\log k}\log n)$ measurements and runtime $O(m)$, with vanishing error probability, improving the recent result of Yang et al., 2025.

### [278] [Experiences from Benchmarking Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11298)
*Yihao Zhang,Yuankai Qi,Xi Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文对四个代表性VLA模型进行基准测试，建立标准化评估框架，揭示VLA模型架构在精度、泛化性和部署成本间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在机器人领域应用的基础模型，特别是VLA模型，缺乏系统的真实世界评估和跨模型比较。

Method: 对ACT、OpenVLA - OFT、RDT - 1B和$π_0$四个VLA模型在四个操作任务上进行基准测试，建立标准化评估框架，从准确率和效率、适应性、语言指令遵循准确率三个维度评估。

Result: $π_0$在分布外场景适应性优越，ACT在分布内稳定性最高，还分析了计算需求、数据缩放行为和常见失败模式。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLA模型架构在平衡精度、泛化性和部署成本方面的实际权衡，为在现实机器人操作任务中选择和部署VLA模型提供了可行的见解。

Abstract: Foundation models applied in robotics, particularly \textbf{Vision--Language--Action (VLA)} models, hold great promise for achieving general-purpose manipulation. Yet, systematic real-world evaluations and cross-model comparisons remain scarce. This paper reports our \textbf{empirical experiences} from benchmarking four representative VLAs -- \textbf{ACT}, \textbf{OpenVLA--OFT}, \textbf{RDT-1B}, and \boldmath{$π_0$} -- across four manipulation tasks conducted in both simulation and on the \textbf{ALOHA Mobile} platform. We establish a \textbf{standardized evaluation framework} that measures performance along three key dimensions: (1) \textit{accuracy and efficiency} (success rate and time-to-success), (2) \textit{adaptability} across in-distribution, spatial out-of-distribution, and instance-plus-spatial out-of-distribution settings, and (3) \textit{language instruction-following accuracy}. Through this process, we observe that \boldmath{$π_0$} demonstrates superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios, while \textbf{ACT} provides the highest stability in-distribution. Further analysis highlights differences in computational demands, data-scaling behavior, and recurring failure modes such as near-miss grasps, premature releases, and long-horizon state drift. These findings reveal practical trade-offs among VLA model architectures in balancing precision, generalization, and deployment cost, offering actionable insights for selecting and deploying VLAs in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

*Jueun Kwon,Max M. Sun,Todd Murphey*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出新的遍历控制公式，用体积状态表示优化空间覆盖，实验证明优于标准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遍历控制将机器人建模为无体积点，与实际不符，需考虑物理体积。

Method: 引入新的遍历控制公式，使用体积状态表示优化空间覆盖，保留渐近覆盖保证，计算开销小，支持任意基于样本的体积模型。

Result: 在搜索和操作任务中，覆盖率提高两倍多，任务完成率 100%，优于标准方法。

Conclusion: 新的遍历控制方法有效，在机械擦除任务中得到验证。

Abstract: Ergodic control synthesizes optimal coverage behaviors over spatial distributions for nonlinear systems. However, existing formulations model the robot as a non-volumetric point, but in practice a robot interacts with the environment through its body and sensors with physical volume. In this work, we introduce a new ergodic control formulation that optimizes spatial coverage using a volumetric state representation. Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a robot arm performing mechanical erasing tasks.

TL;DR: 研究规划者从n个代理人中选一个的机制设计，考虑代理人关系，得出不同情况下机制存在条件及效率比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规划者需设计占优策略激励相容机制来选择理想代理人。

Method: 推导规划者已知和未知代理人双边关系时机制存在的充分条件，比较机制效率，分析满足结构平衡时的特征。

Result: 已知关系时有高效和DSIC机制的充分条件；未知关系时无高效和DSIC机制，有两个次优的DSIC机制；网络满足结构平衡时有明确特征结果。

Conclusion: 为规划者在不同信息下设计选择代理人的机制提供了理论依据。

Abstract: A planner wants to select one agent out of n agents on the basis of a binary characteristic that is commonly known to all agents but is not observed by the planner. Any pair of agents can either be friends or enemies or impartials of each other. An individual's most preferred outcome is that she be selected. If she is not selected, then she would prefer that a friend be selected, and if neither she herself or a friend is selected, then she would prefer that an impartial agent be selected. Finally, her least preferred outcome is that an enemy be selected. The planner wants to design a dominant strategy incentive compatible mechanism in order to be able choose a desirable agent. We derive sufficient conditions for existence of efficient and DSIC mechanisms when the planner knows the bilateral relationships between agents. We also show that if the planner does not know these relationships, then there is no efficient and DSIC mechanism and we compare the relative efficiency of two ``second-best'' DSIC mechanisms. Finally, we obtain sharp characterization results when the network of friends and enemies satisfies structural balance.

*Toshiaki Yamanaka*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文探讨度量旅行商问题（TSP）线性规划（LP）松弛的整性间隙，引入转移原则和割边余量唯一性框架，指出若存在特定实例，TSP整性间隙至多为4/3，但构造此类实例仍是开放问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决确定度量旅行商问题（TSP）线性规划（LP）松弛的整性间隙这一长期未决的问题。

Method: 引入转移原则，当2 - 边连通多子图问题（2ECM）的整数最优解是唯一哈密顿回路时，2ECM的α - 近似算法可用于TSP；开发割边余量唯一性框架来证明T是两个问题的唯一整数最优解，且在ℓ_∞有界扰动下稳定。

Result: 若存在2ECM有唯一哈密顿回路整数最优解和半整数LP解的实例，通过Boyd等人的算法可知TSP整性间隙至多为4/3。

Conclusion: 确定TSP线性规划松弛的整性间隙问题仍未完全解决，构造特定实例是待解决的开放问题。

Abstract: Determining the integrality gap of the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the metric traveling salesman problem (TSP) remains a long-standing open problem. We introduce a transfer principle: when the integer optimum of the 2-edge-connected multisubgraph problem (2ECM) is a unique Hamiltonian cycle $T$, any $α$-approximation algorithm for 2ECM that outputs a Hamiltonian cycle yields an $α$-approximation for TSP. We further develop a cut-margin uniqueness framework that certifies $T$ as the unique integer optimum for both problems and is stable under $\ell_\infty$-bounded perturbations. We show that, if instances exist where the 2ECM has both a unique Hamiltonian cycle integer optimum and a half-integral LP solution, then the TSP integrality gap is at most 4/3 by the algorithm of Boyd et al. (SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 36:1730--1747, 2022). Constructing such instances remains an open problem.

TL;DR: 本文提出双仅额外梯度法（DXG），实现用O(n)内存对ε - 近似OT达到O(n²ε⁻¹)复杂度，数值实验显示其在非/弱正则化制度下有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有一阶方法解决大规模（E）OT问题时，达到最优速率需O(n²)存储，存在权衡。

Method: 将最近提出的原始 - 对偶额外梯度法（PDXG）完全在对偶中实现，证明正则化OT问题等价于EOT并扩展到熵正则重心问题。

Result: 提出的双仅额外梯度法（DXG）是首个用O(n)内存对ε - 近似OT达到O(n²ε⁻¹)复杂度的算法。

Conclusion: 双额外梯度法在非/弱正则化制度下相比现有算法有优势，但某些问题类的性能有待提高。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and its entropy-regularized form (EOT) have become increasingly prominent computational problems, with applications in machine learning and statistics. Recent years have seen a commensurate surge in first-order methods aiming to improve the complexity of large-scale (E)OT. However, there has been a consistent tradeoff: attaining state-of-the-art rates requires $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ storage to enable ergodic primal averaging. In this work, we demonstrate that recently proposed primal-dual extragradient methods (PDXG) can be implemented entirely in the dual with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ storage. Additionally, we prove that regularizing the reformulated OT problem is equivalent to EOT with extensions to entropy-regularized barycenter problems, further widening the applications of the proposed method. The proposed dual-only extragradient method (DXG) is the first algorithm to achieve $\mathcal{O}(n^2\varepsilon^{-1})$ complexity for $\varepsilon$-approximate OT with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ memory. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the dual extragradient method scales favorably in non/weakly-regularized regimes compared to existing algorithms, though future work is needed to improve performance in certain problem classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论收敛分析无法解释非欧几里得SGD在训练深度神经网络中的优越性能。

Method: 在结构化平滑性和梯度噪声假设下进行新的统一收敛分析。

Result: 非欧几里得SGD能利用Hessian和梯度噪声上界的稀疏性或低秩结构，从外推或动量方差减少等算法工具中受益，并达到自适应和更复杂优化算法的先进收敛率。

Conclusion: 新的收敛分析解决了现有理论无法解释非欧几里得SGD优越性能的问题。

Abstract: Recently, several instances of non-Euclidean SGD, including SignSGD, Lion, and Muon, have attracted significant interest from the optimization community due to their practical success in training deep neural networks. Consequently, a number of works have attempted to explain this success by developing theoretical convergence analyses. Unfortunately, these results cannot properly justify the superior performance of these methods, as they could not beat the convergence rate of vanilla Euclidean SGD. We resolve this important open problem by developing a new unified convergence analysis under the structured smoothness and gradient noise assumption. In particular, our results indicate that non-Euclidean SGD (i) can exploit the sparsity or low-rank structure of the upper bounds on the Hessian and gradient noise, (ii) can provably benefit from popular algorithmic tools such as extrapolation or momentum variance reduction, and (iii) can match the state-of-the-art convergence rates of adaptive and more complex optimization algorithms such as AdaGrad and Shampoo.

Abstract: Autonomous laboratories typically rely on data-driven decision-making, occasionally with human-in-the-loop oversight to inject domain expertise. Fully leveraging AI agents, however, requires tightly coupled, collaborative workflows spanning hypothesis generation, experimental planning, execution, and interpretation. To address this, we develop and deploy a human-AI collaborative (HAIC) workflow that integrates large language models for hypothesis generation and analysis, with collaborative policy updates driving autonomous pulsed laser deposition (PLD) experiments for remote epitaxy of BaTiO$_3$/graphene. HAIC accelerated the hypothesis formation and experimental design and efficiently mapped the growth space to graphene-damage. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that chemistry drives degradation while the highest energy plume components seed defects, identifying a low-O$_2$ pressure low-temperature synthesis window that preserves graphene but is incompatible with optimal BaTiO$_3$ growth. Thus, we show a two-step Ar/O$_2$ deposition is required to exfoliate ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ while maintaining a monolayer graphene interlayer. HAIC stages human insight with AI reasoning between autonomous batches to drive rapid scientific progress, providing an evolution to many existing human-in-the-loop autonomous workflows.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出HetDAPAC框架优化分布式属性隐私访问控制，在牺牲部分非敏感属性隐私下提高速率，并提出平衡下载方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAPAC隐私约束过严影响速率，为利用用户属性的异构隐私需求。

Method: 提出HetDAPAC框架，将N-D个属性验证交给中央服务器，对D个敏感属性保留DAPAC架构；提出两种方案。

Result: 第一种方案将速率从1/(2K)提升到1/(K + 1)；第二种方案实现服务器下载平衡，速率为(D + 1)/(2KD)。

Conclusion: HetDAPAC框架能在考虑异构隐私需求下优化分布式属性隐私访问控制的速率。

Abstract: Verifying user attributes to provide fine-grained access control to databases is fundamental to attribute-based authentication. Either a single (central) authority verifies all the attributes, or multiple independent authorities verify the attributes distributedly. In the central setup, the authority verifies all user attributes, and the user downloads only the authorized record. While this is communication efficient, it reveals all user attributes to the authority. A distributed setup prevents this privacy breach by letting each authority verify and learn only one attribute. Motivated by this, Jafarpisheh~et~al. introduced an information-theoretic formulation, called distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC). With $N$ non-colluding authorities (servers), $N$ attributes and $K$ possible values for each attribute, the DAPAC system lets each server learn only the single attribute value that it verifies, and is oblivious to the remaining $N-1$. The user retrieves its designated record, without learning anything about the remaining database records. The goal is to maximize the rate, i.e., the ratio of desired message size to total download size. However, not all attributes are sensitive, and DAPAC's privacy constraints can be too restrictive, negatively affecting the rate. To leverage the heterogeneous privacy requirements of user attributes, we propose heterogeneous (Het)DAPAC, a framework which off-loads verification of $N-D$ of the $N$ attributes to a central server, and retains DAPAC's architecture for the $D$ sensitive attributes. We first present a HetDAPAC scheme, which improves the rate from $\frac{1}{2K}$ to $\frac{1}{K+1}$, while sacrificing the privacy of a few non-sensitive attributes. Unlike DAPAC, our scheme entails a download imbalance across servers; we propose a second scheme achieving a balanced per-server download and a rate of $\frac{D+1}{2KD}$.

Motivation: 现有定向模糊测试引导机制的距离计算不考虑可行性，需改进。

Method: 提出可行性感知的距离计算方法，采用新分类方法预测分支可行性，用运行时可行性更新机制提高预测精度。

Result: AFLGopher在到达目标和触发已知漏洞方面比AFLGo、BEACON等定向模糊器更快。

Conclusion: AFLGopher能基于可行性感知有效引导定向模糊测试，高效到达目标和触发漏洞。

Abstract: Directed fuzzing is a useful testing technique that aims to efficiently reach target code sites in a program. The core of directed fuzzing is the guiding mechanism that directs the fuzzing to the specified target. A general guiding mechanism adopted in existing directed fuzzers is to calculate the control-flow distance between the current progress and the target, and use that as feedback to guide the directed fuzzing. A fundamental problem with the existing guiding mechanism is that the distance calculation is \emph{feasibility-unaware}.
  In this work, we propose feasibility-aware directed fuzzing named AFLGopher. Our new feasibility-aware distance calculation provides pragmatic feedback to guide directed fuzzing to reach targets efficiently. We propose new techniques to address the challenges of feasibility prediction. Our new classification method allows us to predict the feasibility of all branches based on limited traces, and our runtime feasibility-updating mechanism gradually and efficiently improves the prediction precision. We implemented AFLGopher and compared AFLGopher with state-of-the-art directed fuzzers including AFLGo, enhanced AFLGo, WindRanger, BEACON and SelectFuzz. AFLGopher is 3.76x, 2.57x, 3.30x, 2.52x and 2.86x faster than AFLGo, BEACON, WindRanger, SelectFuzz and enhanced AFLGo, respectively, in reaching targets. AFLGopher is 5.60x, 5.20x, 4.98x, 4.52x, and 5.07x faster than AFLGo, BEACON, WindRanger, SelectFuzz and enhanced AFLGo, respectively, in triggering known vulnerabilities.

Motivation: 现有自动漏洞修复技术效果有限，现有漏洞基准存在过时、语言覆盖不足等问题，需新基准评估LLM在AVR中的能力。

Result: 对一系列LLM和代理进行评估，获得深入分析结果。

Conclusion: 研究为AVR未来研究提供关键见解。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities are increasing at an alarming rate. However, manual patching is both time-consuming and resource-intensive, while existing automated vulnerability repair (AVR) techniques remain limited in effectiveness. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened a new paradigm for AVR, demonstrating remarkable progress. To examine the capability of LLMs in AVR, several vulnerability benchmarks have been proposed recently. However, they still suffer from key limitations of outdated vulnerabilities, limited language coverage, unreliable patch validation, and insufficient reproducibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PATCHEVAL, a multilingual benchmark for Go, JavaScript, and Python, languages for which existing benchmarks remain unexplored. PATCHEVAL curates a dataset of 1,000 vulnerabilities drawn from CVEs reported between 2015 and 2025, covering 65 distinct CWEs. A subset of 230 CVEs is further equipped with runtime sandbox environments, enabling patch verification through both security tests and functionality tests. To provide a systematic comparison of LLM-based vulnerability repair, we evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and agents, presenting an in-depth analysis that empirically yields key insights to guide future research in AVR.

TL;DR: 现有模型合并防御机制无法有效保护模型，提出MergeBarrier可有效防止模型合并窃取且精度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并存在窃取威胁，现有防御机制无法同时满足主动防止未经授权合并、兼容开源设置和高安全性低性能损失三个关键保护属性。

Method: 提出MergeBarrier，核心是破坏受保护模型与其同源模型之间的线性模式连通性。

Result: 大量实验表明MergeBarrier能有效防止模型合并窃取，精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: MergeBarrier是一种能有效解决模型合并窃取问题的即插即用防御方法。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient technique for expanding large language models (LLMs) by integrating specialized expert models. However, it also introduces a new threat: model merging stealing, where free-riders exploit models through unauthorized model merging. Unfortunately, existing defense mechanisms fail to provide effective protection. Specifically, we identify three critical protection properties that existing methods fail to simultaneously satisfy: (1) proactively preventing unauthorized merging; (2) ensuring compatibility with general open-source settings; (3) achieving high security with negligible performance loss. To address the above issues, we propose MergeBarrier, a plug-and-play defense that proactively prevents unauthorized merging. The core design of MergeBarrier is to disrupt the Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) between the protected model and its homologous counterparts, thereby eliminating the low-loss path required for effective model merging. Extensive experiments show that MergeBarrier effectively prevents model merging stealing with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: 揭示CoT系统推理效率可被隐蔽操纵的新漏洞，展现针对CoT系统的新类型复杂攻击。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially improved the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but have also introduced their computational efficiency as a new attack surface. In this paper, we propose BadThink, the first backdoor attack designed to deliberately induce "overthinking" behavior in CoT-enabled LLMs while ensuring stealth. When activated by carefully crafted trigger prompts, BadThink manipulates the model to generate inflated reasoning traces - producing unnecessarily redundant thought processes while preserving the consistency of final outputs. This subtle attack vector creates a covert form of performance degradation that significantly increases computational costs and inference time while remaining difficult to detect through conventional output evaluation methods. We implement this attack through a sophisticated poisoning-based fine-tuning strategy, employing a novel LLM-based iterative optimization process to embed the behavior by generating highly naturalistic poisoned data. Our experiments on multiple state-of-the-art models and reasoning tasks show that BadThink consistently increases reasoning trace lengths - achieving an over 17x increase on the MATH-500 dataset - while remaining stealthy and robust. This work reveals a critical, previously unexplored vulnerability where reasoning efficiency can be covertly manipulated, demonstrating a new class of sophisticated attacks against CoT-enabled systems.

TL;DR: 现有长上下文大语言模型易受提示注入攻击，现有防御方法在长上下文场景效果有限，本文提出PISanitizer可预防攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文大语言模型易受提示注入攻击且现有防御方法在长上下文场景效果不佳的问题。

Method: PISanitizer先定位并清理上下文中潜在的注入令牌，基于两个观察：攻击是让模型遵循指令，模型利用注意力机制关注关键输入。先让模型遵循任意指令，再清理引起模型遵循指令行为且获高注意力的令牌。

Result: PISanitizer能成功预防提示注入，保持实用性，优于现有防御方法，高效且能抵御基于优化和强自适应攻击。

Conclusion: PISanitizer是一种有效的长上下文大语言模型提示注入防御方案。

Abstract: Long context LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection, where an attacker can inject an instruction in a long context to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-desired output. Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks.

Abstract: Healthcare AI systems face major vulnerabilities to data poisoning that current defenses and regulations cannot adequately address. We analyzed eight attack scenarios in four categories: architectural attacks on convolutional neural networks, large language models, and reinforcement learning agents; infrastructure attacks exploiting federated learning and medical documentation systems; critical resource allocation attacks affecting organ transplantation and crisis triage; and supply chain attacks targeting commercial foundation models. Our findings indicate that attackers with access to only 100-500 samples can compromise healthcare AI regardless of dataset size, often achieving over 60 percent success, with detection taking an estimated 6 to 12 months or sometimes not occurring at all. The distributed nature of healthcare infrastructure creates many entry points where insiders with routine access can launch attacks with limited technical skill. Privacy laws such as HIPAA and GDPR can unintentionally shield attackers by restricting the analyses needed for detection. Supply chain weaknesses allow a single compromised vendor to poison models across 50 to 200 institutions. The Medical Scribe Sybil scenario shows how coordinated fake patient visits can poison data through legitimate clinical workflows without requiring a system breach. Current regulations lack mandatory adversarial robustness testing, and federated learning can worsen risks by obscuring attribution. We recommend multilayer defenses including required adversarial testing, ensemble-based detection, privacy-preserving security mechanisms, and international coordination on AI security standards. We also question whether opaque black-box models are suitable for high-stakes clinical decisions, suggesting a shift toward interpretable systems with verifiable safety guarantees.

Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has been repeatedly proposed as a biometric modality, often with reports of high accuracy and operational feasibility. However, the field lacks a consolidated understanding of its security properties, adversarial resilience, and methodological consistency. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines CSI-based biometric authentication through a security perspective, analyzing how existing work differs across sensing infrastructure, signal representations, feature pipelines, learning models, and evaluation methodologies. Our synthesis reveals systemic inconsistencies: reliance on aggregate accuracy metrics, limited reporting of FAR/FRR/EER, absence of per-user risk analysis, and scarce consideration of threat models or adversarial feasibility. We construct a unified evaluation framework to empirically expose these issues and demonstrate how security-relevant metrics, such as per-class EER, FCS, and the Gini Coefficient, uncover risk concentration that remains hidden under traditional reporting practices. Our analysis highlights concrete attack surfaces and shows how methodological choices materially influence vulnerability profiles, which include replay, geometric mimicry, and environmental perturbation. Based on these findings, we articulate the security boundaries of current CSI biometrics and provide guidelines for rigorous evaluation, reproducible experimentation, and future research directions. This SoK offers the security community a structured, evidence-driven reassessment of Wi-Fi CSI biometrics and their suitability as an authentication primitive.

Abstract: The routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) has become the de facto routing standard for resource-constrained IoT systems, but its lightweight design exposes critical vulnerabilities to a wide range of routing-layer attacks such as hello flood, decreased rank, and version number manipulation. Traditional countermeasures, including protocol-level modifications and machine learning classifiers, can achieve high accuracy against known threats, yet they fail when confronted with novel or zero-day attacks unless fully retrained, an approach that is impractical for dynamic IoT environments. In this paper, we investigate incremental learning as a practical and adaptive strategy for intrusion detection in RPL-based networks. We systematically evaluate five model families, including ensemble models and deep learning models. Our analysis highlights that incremental learning not only restores detection performance on new attack classes but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously learned threats, all while reducing training time compared to full retraining. By combining five diverse models with attack-specific analysis, forgetting behavior, and time efficiency, this study provides systematic evidence that incremental learning offers a scalable pathway to maintain resilient intrusion detection in evolving RPL-based IoT networks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has rapidly emerged as a transformative approach for integrating large language models into clinical and biomedical workflows. However, privacy risks, such as protected health information (PHI) exposure, remain inconsistently mitigated. This review provides a thorough analysis of the current landscape of RAG applications in healthcare, including (i) sensitive data type across clinical scenarios, (ii) the associated privacy risks, (iii) current and emerging data-privacy protection mechanisms and (iv) future direction for patient data privacy protection. We synthesize 23 articles on RAG applications in healthcare and systematically analyze privacy challenges through a pipeline-structured framework encompassing data storage, transmission, retrieval and generation stages, delineating potential failure modes, their underlying causes in threat models and system mechanisms, and their practical implications. Building on this analysis, we critically review 17 articles on privacy-preserving strategies for RAG systems. Our evaluation reveals critical gaps, including insufficient clinical validation, absence of standardized evaluation frameworks, and lack of automated assessment tools. We propose actionable directions based on these limitations and conclude with a call to action. This review provides researchers and practitioners with a structured framework for understanding privacy vulnerabilities in healthcare RAG and offers a roadmap toward developing systems that achieve both clinical effectiveness and robust privacy preservation.

TL;DR: 提出新算法MSS用于局部差分隐私频率估计，降低通信成本，有良好性能和低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低局部差分隐私频率估计的用户通信成本，避免现有协议的一些缺点。

Method: 通过剩余数系统（RNS）编码输入，结合SubsetSelection算法，随机选择索引并报告扰动后的余数。

Result: 用户通信成本降低，解码时间为Θ(n + r k ℓ)，最坏情况MSE与现有协议相当，估计精度匹配，解码更快，消息更短，攻击成功率最低。

Conclusion: MSS算法在局部差分隐私频率估计中表现良好，具有低通信成本、高效解码和低攻击风险等优势。

Abstract: We present \textsf{ModularSubsetSelection} (MSS), a new algorithm for locally differentially private (LDP) frequency estimation. Given a universe of size $k$ and $n$ users, our $\varepsilon$-LDP mechanism encodes each input via a Residue Number System (RNS) over $\ell$ pairwise-coprime moduli $m_0, \ldots, m_{\ell-1}$, and reports a randomly chosen index $j \in [\ell]$ along with the perturbed residue using the statistically optimal \textsf{SubsetSelection}~(SS) (Wang et al. 2016). This design reduces the user communication cost from $Θ\bigl(ω\log_2(k/ω)\bigr)$ bits required by standard SS (with $ω\approx k/(e^\varepsilon+1)$) down to $\lceil \log_2 \ell \rceil + \lceil \log_2 m_j \rceil$ bits, where $m_j < k$. Server-side decoding runs in $Θ(n + r k \ell)$ time, where $r$ is the number of LSMR (Fong and Saunders 2011) iterations. In practice, with well-conditioned moduli (\textit{i.e.}, constant $r$ and $\ell = Θ(\log k)$), this becomes $Θ(n + k \log k)$. We prove that MSS achieves worst-case MSE within a constant factor of state-of-the-art protocols such as SS and \textsf{ProjectiveGeometryResponse} (PGR) (Feldman et al. 2022), while avoiding the algebraic prerequisites and dynamic-programming decoder required by PGR. Empirically, MSS matches the estimation accuracy of SS, PGR, and \textsf{RAPPOR} (Erlingsson, Pihur, and Korolova 2014) across realistic $(k, \varepsilon)$ settings, while offering faster decoding than PGR and shorter user messages than SS. Lastly, by sampling from multiple moduli and reporting only a single perturbed residue, MSS achieves the lowest reconstruction-attack success rate among all evaluated LDP protocols.

Result: 在100节点TSP上，相比使用解析表达式的强化学习模拟，将总模拟时间减少96.4%，测试集平均最优差距在0.005内。

Conclusion: SIGS为量子强化学习社区提供实用基准工具，还给出超越先前文献中不变性概念的理论解释。

Abstract: The Equivariant Quantum Circuit (EQC) for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been shown to achieve near-optimal performance in solving small TSP problems (up to 20 nodes) using only two parameters at depth 1. However, extending EQCs to larger TSP problem sizes remains challenging due to the exponential time and memory for quantum circuit simulation, as well as increasing noise and decoherence when running on actual quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Size-Invariant Grid Search (SIGS), an efficient training optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), and use it to simulate the outputs of a trained Depth-1 EQC up to 350-node TSP instances - well beyond previously tractable limits. At TSP with 100 nodes, we reduce total simulation times by 96.4%, when comparing to RL simulations with the analytical expression (151 minutes using RL to under 6 minutes using SIGS on TSP-100), while achieving a mean optimality gap within 0.005 of the RL trained model on the test set. SIGS provides a practical benchmarking tool for the QRL community, allowing us to efficiently analyze the performance of QRL algorithms on larger problem sizes. We provide a theoretical explanation for SIGS called the Size-Invariant Properties that goes beyond the concept of equivariance discussed in prior literature.

Abstract: Quantum Computing is a rapidly developing field with the potential to tackle the increasing computational challenges faced in high-energy physics. In this work, we explore the potential and limitations of variational quantum algorithms in solving the particle track reconstruction problem. We present an analysis of two distinct formulations for identifying straight-line tracks in a multilayer detection system, inspired by the LHCb vertex detector. The first approach is formulated as a ground-state energy problem, while the second approach is formulated as a system of linear equations. This work addresses one of the main challenges when dealing with variational quantum algorithms on general problems, namely designing an expressive and efficient quantum ansatz working on tracking events with fixed detector geometry. For this purpose, we employed a quantum architecture search method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to design the quantum circuits for different problem sizes. We provide experimental results to test our approach on both formulations for different problem sizes in terms of performance and computational cost.
