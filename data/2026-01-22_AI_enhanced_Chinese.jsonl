In public defense, where a constitutional right to counsel meets the complexities of law, overwhelming caseloads and constrained resources, practitioners face especially taxing conditions. Yet, there is little evidence of how AI could meaningfully support defenders' day-to-day work. In partnership with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, we develop the NJ BriefBank, a retrieval tool which surfaces relevant appellate briefs to streamline legal research and writing. We show that existing legal retrieval benchmarks fail to transfer to public defense search, however adding domain knowledge improves retrieval quality. This includes query expansion with legal reasoning, domain-specific data and curated synthetic examples. To facilitate further research, we provide a taxonomy of realistic defender search queries and release a manually annotated public defense retrieval dataset.

A key challenge for improving RAG is to predict both the utility of retrieved documents -- quantified as the performance gain from using context over generation without context -- and the quality of the final answers in terms of correctness and relevance. In this paper, we define two prediction tasks within RAG. The first is retrieval performance prediction (RPP), which estimates the utility of retrieved documents. The second is generation performance prediction (GPP), which estimates the final answer quality. We hypothesise that in RAG, the topical relevance of retrieved documents correlates with their utility, suggesting that query performance prediction (QPP) approaches can be adapted for RPP and GPP. Beyond these retriever-centric signals, we argue that reader-centric features, such as the LLM's perplexity of the retrieved context conditioned on the input query, can further enhance prediction accuracy for both RPP and GPP. Finally, we propose that features reflecting query-agnostic document quality and readability can also provide useful signals to the predictions. We train linear regression models with the above categories of predictors for both RPP and GPP. Experiments on the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset show that combining predictors from multiple feature categories yields the most accurate estimates of RAG performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4bRAG\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8RAG\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u7684\u6548\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347RAG\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\uff08RPP\uff09\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\uff08GPP\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u8bfb\u8005\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6587\u6863\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Natural Questions\uff08NQ\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u522b\u7ec4\u5408\u5bf9RAG\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1RAG\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, these text encoders are primarily optimized for well-formed natural language. In real-world recommendation data, item descriptions are often symbolic and attribute-centric, containing numerals, units, and abbreviations. These text encoders can break these signals into fragmented tokens, weakening semantic coherence and distorting relationships among attributes. Worse still, when moving to multimodal GR, relying on standard text encoders introduces an additional obstacle: text and image embeddings often exhibit mismatched geometric structures, making cross-modal fusion less effective and less stable.\n  In this paper, we revisit representation design for Semantic ID learning by treating text as a visual signal. We conduct a systematic empirical study of OCR-based text representations, obtained by rendering item descriptions into images and encoding them with vision-based OCR models. Experiments across four datasets and two generative backbones show that OCR-text consistently matches or surpasses standard text embeddings for Semantic ID learning in both unimodal and multimodal settings. Furthermore, we find that OCR-based Semantic IDs remain robust under extreme spatial-resolution compression, indicating strong robustness and efficiency in practical deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49ID\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eOCR\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aOCR\u6587\u672c\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u8350\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u7b26\u53f7\u6027\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u8fd8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eOCR\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9879\u76ee\u63cf\u8ff0\u6e32\u67d3\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684OCR\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOCR\u6587\u672c\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49ID\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8eOCR\u7684\u8bed\u4e49ID\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eOCR\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49ID\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u548c\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \\ldots, k_{\\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{\\ell}$ such that for all $i \\in [\\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \\leq k_i$ and for all $i \\neq j$, $S_i \\cap S_j=\\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization.

As a result, there is growing demand for fast, accurate, and widely generalizable GPU performance models to support next-generation hardware selection and system-level exploration. However, current data-driven methods are limited, exhibiting poor generalization across hardware and inadequate modeling of complex production-level kernels common in modern inference stacks. To address these issues, we present SyncPerf, a unified GPU modeling framework. This approach first employs an analytical model to quantify a given kernel's demands on the GPU's heterogeneous instruction pipelines. These analytical features are then fed into a machine learning (ML) model to capture complex cross-pipeline interactions and resource dependencies, enabling high-fidelity performance prediction. Our evaluation across 11 GPU types from four generations of major architectures on two widely-used serving systems demonstrates that SyncPerf delivers high fidelity and strong generalizability. It achieves accurate predictions, with only 6.1% average error at the kernel level and 8.5% for end-to-end inference -- reducing the error of state-of-the-art methods by 6.7x and 4.4x, respectively.

Such scenarios frequently arise in domains like DNA sequence design and robotics, where only a few labeled data points are available. Traditional methods typically rely on task-specific proxy or generative models, overlooking the in-context learning capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts have adapted autoregressive LLMs to BBO by framing task descriptions and offline datasets as natural language prompts, enabling direct design generation. However, these designs often contain bidirectional dependencies, which left-to-right models struggle to capture. In this paper, we explore diffusion LLMs for BBO, leveraging their bidirectional modeling and iterative refinement capabilities. This motivates our in-context denoising module: we condition the diffusion LLM on the task description and the offline dataset, both formatted in natural language, and prompt it to denoise masked designs into improved candidates. To guide the generation toward high-performing designs, we introduce masked diffusion tree search, which casts the denoising process as a step-wise Monte Carlo Tree Search that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation. Each node represents a partially masked design, each denoising step is an action, and candidates are evaluated via expected improvement under a Gaussian Process trained on the offline dataset.

Submitted to the European Journal of Operational Research", "summary": "The Conflict-Driven Cylindrical Algebraic Covering algorithm has proven well suited for performing theory validation checks in the satisfiability modulo theories paradigm for non-linear real arithmetic. CDCAC repurposes the theory underpinning classical cylindrical algebraic decomposition for SMT solving and is implemented in the SMT solvers cvc5 and SMT-RAT, as well as the computer algebra system Maple. It was previously observed that when using cylindrical algebraic decomposition for an SMT theory call, the output can be optimised by solving a single set covering problem instance that minimises the conflict clause. In this paper we consider the corresponding optimisation for CDCAC and observe that CDCAC naturally gives rise to multiple such optimisations within a single call. Each time a covering is generalised in one dimension, the resulting cell in the next dimension is labelled with theory constraints that cannot be satisfied together. We seek the smallest subset of constraints whose union covers all labels from the cells in the current covering. We call this optimisation problem a set covering problem with reasons. To simplify this problem, we introduce a data reduction step that generalises Beasley reduction for the classical set covering problem and show that this step alone solves many of the instances arising from SMT-LIB benchmarks.

However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&A tasks in the customer service domain.

Albergo", "Yee Whye Teh"], "title": "Meta Flow Maps enable scalable reward alignment", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Controlling generative models is computationally expensive. This is because optimal alignment with a reward function--whether via inference-time steering or fine-tuning--requires estimating the value function. This task demands access to the conditional posterior $p_{1|t}(x_1|x_t)$, the distribution of clean data $x_1$ consistent with an intermediate state $x_t$, a requirement that typically compels methods to resort to costly trajectory simulations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Meta Flow Maps (MFMs), a framework extending consistency models and flow maps into the stochastic regime. MFMs are trained to perform stochastic one-step posterior sampling, generating arbitrarily many i.i.d. draws of clean data $x_1$ from any intermediate state.

While prior work has applied this concept to data valuation in machine learning, existing formulations overwhelmingly assume that each participant contributes a fixed, deterministic dataset. In practice, however, data owners often provide samples drawn from underlying probabilistic distributions, introducing stochasticity into their marginal contributions and rendering the Shapley value itself a random variable. This work addresses this gap by proposing a framework for the Shapley value of probabilistic data distributions that quantifies both the expected contribution and the variance of each participant, thereby capturing uncertainty induced by random sampling. We develop theoretical and empirical methodologies for estimating these quantities: on the theoretical side, we derive unbiased estimators for the expectation and variance of the probabilistic Shapley value and analyze their statistical properties; on the empirical side, we introduce three Monte Carlo-based estimation algorithms - a baseline estimator using independent samples, a pooled estimator that improves efficiency through sample reuse, and a stratified pooled estimator that adaptively allocates sampling budget based on player-specific variability. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that these methods achieve strong accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, with the stratified pooled approach attaining substantial variance reduction at minimal additional cost. By extending Shapley value analysis from deterministic datasets to probabilistic data distributions, this work provides both theoretical rigor and practical tools for fair and reliable data valuation in modern stochastic data-sharing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684Shapley\u503c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u9884\u671f\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027 - \u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Shapley\u503c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u503c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u56fa\u5b9a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u6240\u6709\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6709\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684Shapley\u503c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63a8\u5bfc\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027 - \u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c06Shapley\u503c\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6982\u7387\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u516c\u5e73\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This study is a part of a series of subsequent works to fine-tune model risk analysis for cryptocurrencies. Through this first research work, we establish a foundational benchmark by applying the traditional industry-standard Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. Popularly used for non-crypto financial assets, GBM assumes Lognormal return distributions for a multi-asset cryptocurrency portfolio (XRP, SOL, ADA). This work utilizes Maximum Likelihood Estimation and a correlated Monte Carlo Simulation incorporating the Cholesky decomposition of historical covariance. We present our stock portfolio model as a Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP). We observe the model's structural shift within the heavy-tailed, non-Gaussian cryptocurrency environment. The results reveal limitations of the Lognormal assumption: the calculated Value-at-Risk at the 5% confidence level over the one-year horizon. For baselining our results, we also present a holistic comparative analysis with an equity portfolio (AAPL, TSLA, NVDA), demonstrating a significantly lower failure rate. This performance provides conclusive evidence that the GBM model is fundamentally the perfect benchmark for our subsequent works.

The method explicitly parameterizes the missingness mechanism by modelling the probability of missingness as a function of classification uncertainty. To quantify classification uncertainty, we introduce margin confidence and incorporate the Aranda Ordaz (AO) link function to flexibly capture the asymmetric relationships between uncertainty and missing probability. Based on this formulation, we develop an efficient Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm that jointly estimates all parameters appearing in both the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the missingness mechanism, and subsequently imputes the missing labels by a Bayesian classifier derived from the fitted mixture model. This method effectively alleviates the bias induced by ignoring the missingness mechanism while enhancing the robustness of semi-supervised learning.

However, the diverse AMT landscape makes fair comparisons challenging. Task Bench, proposed by Slaughter et al., addresses this challenge through a parameterized framework for evaluating parallel programming systems. This work integrates two recent cluster AMTs, Itoyori and ItoyoriFBC, into Task Bench for comprehensive evaluation against MPI and HPX. Itoyori employs a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model with RDMA-based work stealing, while ItoyoriFBC extends it with futurebased synchronization.\n  We evaluate these systems in terms of both performance and programmer productivity. Performance is assessed across various configurations, including compute-bound kernels, weak scaling, and both imbalanced and communication-intensive patterns. Performance is quantified using application efficiency, i.e., the percentage of maximum performance achieved, and the Minimum Effective Task Granularity (METG), i.e., the smallest task duration before runtime overheads dominate. Programmer productivity is quantified using Lines of Code (LOC) and the Number of Library Constructs (NLC).\n  Our results reveal distinct trade-offs. MPI achieves the highest efficiency for regular, communication-light workloads but requires verbose, lowlevel code. HPX maintains stable efficiency under load imbalance across varying node counts, yet ranks last in productivity metrics, demonstrating that AMTs do not inherently guarantee improved productivity over MPI.

This design improves population diversity during search and reduces premature convergence while preserving the exploration behavior of GEO.\n  GEGO is evaluated on standard unimodal, multimodal, and composite benchmark functions from the CEC2017 suite, where it consistently outperforms its constituent algorithms and several classical metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and robustness. The algorithm is further applied to hyperparameter tuning of artificial neural networks on the MNIST dataset, where GEGO achieves improved classification accuracy and more stable convergence compared to GEO and GA.

This paper presents DDSA (Dual-Domain Strategic Attack), a resource-efficient adversarial robustness testing framework that optimizes testing through temporal selectivity and spatial precision. We introduce a scenario-aware trigger function that identifies critical frames requiring robustness evaluation based on class priority and model uncertainty, and employ explainable AI techniques to locate influential pixel regions for targeted perturbation.

Building on our previous work, which defined and validated a multidimensional KPI framework for DAO sustainability, this paper moves from theory to practice by operationalising that framework in software infrastructure designed for finance and FinTech contexts. The system ingests governance and treasury data from major EVM networks, harmonises the outputs, and computes sustainability scores across four dimensions: participation, accumulated funds, voting efficiency, and decentralisation. A composite 0 to 12 score is then derived using transparent thresholds that are applied client-side in the browser.\n  Using a curated snapshot of more than 50 active DAOs covering 6,930 proposals and 317,317 unique voting addresses, we show how the platform surfaces recurring patterns such as persistently low participation and concentration of proposal activity.

While this paradigm has accumulated a massive body of surrounding literature since its inception in the late '50s, we are still very much in the dark as far as basic computational questions are concerned, perhaps due to the intrinsic complexity of dynamic policies in this context. The latter feature forced earlier attempts to either study highly-structured classes of policies or to forgo provably-good performance guarantees altogether; to this day, rigorously analyzable results have been few and far between.\n  The current paper develops novel analytical foundations for directly competing against dynamic policies. Combined with further algorithmic progress and newly-gained insights, these ideas culminate in a polynomial-time approximation scheme for constantly-many commodities. In this regard, the efficient design of $\u03b5$-optimal dynamic policies appeared to have been out of reach, since beyond their inherent algorithmic challenges, even the polynomial-space representation of such policies has been a fundamental open question.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ed3\u5e93\u5e93\u5b58\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u8865\u8d27\u7b56\u7565\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u591a\u5546\u54c1\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ed3\u5e93\u6279\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u81ea\u63d0\u51fa\u540e\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u7814\u7a76\u6b20\u7f3a\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5f88\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u9488\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u5546\u54c1\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ed3\u5e93\u6279\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u8865\u8d27\u7b56\u7565\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1\u03b5 - \u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

As the platform's popularity continues to grow, it has become a target of choice for recent software supply chain attacks. These attacks exploit excessive permissions, ambiguous versions, or the absence of artifact integrity checks to compromise workflows. In response to these attacks, several security scanners have emerged to help developers harden their workflows.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic comparison of 9 GitHub Actions workflow security scanners. We compare them in terms of scope (which security weaknesses they target), detection capabilities (how many weaknesses they detect), and usability (how long they take to scan a workflow). To compare scanners on a common ground, we first establish a taxonomy of 10 security weaknesses that can occur in GitHub Actions workflows. Then, we run the scanners against a curated set of 596 workflows.\n  Our study reveals that the landscape of GitHub Actions workflow security scanners is diverse, with both broad-scope tools and very focused ones. More importantly, we show that scanners interpret security weaknesses differently, leading to significant differences in the type and number of reported weaknesses.

Yet their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5baa\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6765\u6e90\u5f52\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e24\u79cd\u5baa\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u4e3b\u5f20\u81ea\u7531\u6d3e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5baa\u6cd5\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0eAI\u8ba4\u77e5\u6cbb\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u63a8\u7406\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f62\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u53d7\u9690\u5f0f\u3001\u672a\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u653f\u7b56\u652f\u914d\uff0c\u9700\u660e\u786e\u53ef\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u5143\u89c4\u8303\u6765\u89c4\u8303\u5176\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u6765\u6e90\u5f52\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u67cf\u62c9\u56fe\u5f0f\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u6d3e\u4e24\u79cd\u5baa\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6765\u6e90\u5f52\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u504f\u5dee\u6548\u679c\u6d88\u5931\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5baa\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u5f20\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u7531\u6d3e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5baa\u6cd5\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u516b\u9879\u539f\u5219\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u53d6\u5411\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3aAI\u8ba4\u77e5\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u7c7b\u4f3cAI\u4f26\u7406\u7684\u660e\u786e\u53ef\u4e89\u8bae\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

By taking advantage of the inherent randomness of wireless channels, Physical Layer Security (PLS) offers a promising paradigm; however, its efficacy in massive MIMO is heavily reliant on resource allocation and transmission strategies.

In this paper, we propose POEM (Proximal Policy Optimization with Evolutionary Mutations), a novel modification to PPO that introduces an adaptive exploration mechanism inspired by evolutionary algorithms. POEM enhances policy diversity by monitoring the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a moving average of previous policies. When policy changes become minimal, indicating stagnation, POEM triggers an adaptive mutation of policy parameters to promote exploration. We evaluate POEM on four OpenAI Gym environments: CarRacing, MountainCar, BipedalWalker, and LunarLander. Through extensive fine-tuning using Bayesian optimization techniques and statistical testing using Welch's t-test, we find that POEM significantly outperforms PPO on three of the four tasks (BipedalWalker: t=-2.0642, p=0.0495; CarRacing: t=-6.3987, p=0.0002; MountainCar: t=-6.2431, p<0.0001), while performance on LunarLander is not statistically significant (t=-1.8707, p=0.0778).

In an offline phase, a comprehensive database of simulated material responses, so-called material fingerprints, is generated for a predefined experimental setup.

To this end, the experimentally measured fingerprint is compared with all fingerprints in the database to identify the closest match. The primary advantage of this strategy is that it does not require solving a continuous optimization problem. This avoids the associated computational costs as well as issues of ill-posedness caused by local minima in non-convex optimization landscapes.

Even though this model has generated a vast body of literature over the last six decades, our algorithmic understanding has remained surprisingly limited. Indeed, for general problem instances, the best-known approximation guarantees have remained at a factor of $2$ since the mid-1990s. These guarantees were attained by the now-classic work of Anily [Operations Research, 1991] and Gallego, Queyranne, and Simchi-Levi [Operations Research, 1996] via the highly-structured class of \"stationary order sizes and stationary intervals\" (SOSI) policies, thereby avoiding direct competition against fully dynamic policies.\n  The main contribution of this paper resides in developing new analytical foundations and algorithmic techniques that enable such direct comparisons, leading to the first provable improvement over the $2$-approximation barrier. Leveraging these ideas, we design a constructive approach that allows us to balance cost and capacity at a finer granularity than previously possible via SOSI-based methods. Consequently, given any economic warehouse lot scheduling instance, we present a polynomial-time construction of a random capacity-feasible dynamic policy whose expected long-run average cost is within factor $2-\\frac{17}{5000} + \u03b5$ of optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ed3\u5e93\u6279\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e862 - \u8fd1\u4f3c\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u6210\u672c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u76842 - 17/5000 + \u03b5 \u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u53bb\u516d\u5341\u5e74\u91cc\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ed3\u5e93\u6279\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u867d\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u7b97\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u81ea90\u5e74\u4ee3\u4e2d\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u56e0\u5b50\u4e00\u76f4\u4e3a2\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eSOSI\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4ea7\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6784\u9020\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5bb9\u91cf\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5176\u671f\u671b\u957f\u671f\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672c\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u76842 - 17/5000 + \u03b5 \u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf92 - \u8fd1\u4f3c\u969c\u788d\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

To address this, we conduct an analysis of token consumption patterns in an LLM-MA system within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), aiming to understand where tokens are consumed across distinct software engineering activities. We analyze execution traces from 30 software development tasks performed by the ChatDev framework using a GPT-5 reasoning model, mapping its internal phases to distinct development stages (Design, Coding, Code Completion, Code Review, Testing, and Documentation) to create a standardized evaluation framework. We then quantify and compare token distribution (input, output, reasoning) across these stages.\n  Our preliminary findings show that the iterative Code Review stage accounts for the majority of token consumption for an average of 59.4% of tokens. Furthermore, we observe that input tokens consistently constitute the largest share of consumption for an average of 53.9%, providing empirical evidence for potentially significant inefficiencies in agentic collaboration.

These signals include modality-specific cues, information shared across modalities, and interactions that emerge only when modalities are combined. In information-theoretic terms, these correspond to \\emph{unique}, \\emph{redundant}, and \\emph{synergistic} contributions. An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \\emph{\\textbf{D}ivide and \\textbf{R}efine} (\\textbf{DnR}). In the \\textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \\textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations as a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition.

We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale.

We propose FedRD, a communication-efficient framework for federated risk difference estimation in distributed survival data. Unlike typical federated learning frameworks (e.g., FedAvg) that require persistent server connections and extensive iterative communication, FedRD is server-independent with minimal communication: one round of summary statistics exchange for the stratified model and three rounds for the unstratified model. Crucially, FedRD provides valid confidence intervals and hypothesis testing--capabilities absent in FedAvg-based frameworks. We provide theoretical guarantees by establishing the asymptotic properties of FedRD and prove that FedRD (unstratified) is asymptotically equivalent to pooled individual-level analysis.

We investigate how real-time facial communication influences cooperation in repeated social dilemmas. In a laboratory experiment, participants play a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game under two conditions: in one, they observe their counterpart's facial expressions via gender-neutral avatars, and in the other no facial cues are available. Using state-of-the-art biometric technology to capture and display emotions in real-time, we find that facial communication significantly increases overall cooperation and, notably, promotes cooperation following defection. This restorative effect suggests that facial expressions help participants interpret defections less harshly, fostering forgiveness and the resumption of cooperation. While past actions remain the strongest predictor of behavior, our findings highlight the communicative power of facial expressions in shaping strategic outcomes.

Citation prediction aims to automatically suggest appropriate references, helping scholars navigate the expanding scientific literature. Here we present \\textbf{CiteRAG}, the first comprehensive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-integrated benchmark for evaluating large language models on academic citation prediction, featuring a multi-level retrieval strategy, specialized retrievers, and generators. Our benchmark makes four core contributions: (1) We establish two instances of the citation prediction task with different granularity. Task 1 focuses on coarse-grained list-specific citation prediction, while Task 2 targets fine-grained position-specific citation prediction. To enhance these two tasks, we build a dataset containing 7,267 instances for Task 1 and 8,541 instances for Task 2, enabling comprehensive evaluation of both retrieval and generation. (2) We construct a three-level large-scale corpus with 554k papers spanning many major subfields, using an incremental pipeline. (3) We propose a multi-level hybrid RAG approach for citation prediction, fine-tuning embedding models with contrastive learning to capture complex citation relationships, paired with specialized generation models. (4) We conduct extensive experiments across state-of-the-art language models, including closed-source APIs, open-source models, and our fine-tuned generators, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

Ensuring correctness of RDMA programs has only recently become possible with the formalisation of $\\text{RDMA}^\\text{TSO}$ semantics (describing the behaviour of RDMA networking over a TSO CPU). However, this semantics currently lacks a formalisation of remote synchronisation, meaning that the implementations of common abstractions such as locks cannot be verified. In this paper, we close this gap by presenting $\\text{RDMA}^{\\text{TSO}}_{\\text{RMW}}$, the first semantics for remote `read-modify-write' (RMW) instructions over TSO. It turns out that remote RMW operations are weak and only ensure atomicity against other remote RMWs. We therefore build a set of composable synchronisation abstractions starting with the $\\text{RDMA}^{\\text{WAIT}}_{\\text{RMW}}$ library. Underpinned by $\\text{RDMA}^{\\text{WAIT}}_{\\text{RMW}}$, we then specify, implement and verify three classes of remote locks that are suitable for different scenarios. Additionally, we develop the notion of a strong RDMA model, $\\text{RDMA}^{\\text{SC}}_{\\text{RMW}}$, which is akin to sequential consistency in shared memory architectures.

In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.\n  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.\n  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u817a\u764c\u8de8\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u548cDANN\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u67d3\u8272\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DANN\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u4e14\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u7269\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u764c\u75c7\u75c5\u7406\u9886\u57df\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u764c\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ResNet50\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aDANN\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u67d3\u8272\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7528Integrated Gradients\u5206\u6790DANN\u5173\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u764c\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ResNet50\u5728\u81ea\u8eab\u57df\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8598%\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\uff1bDANN\u5728\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u5982\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u80ba\u6570\u636e\u8fbe95.56%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u67d3\u8272\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u800c\u5f02\uff1bDANN\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u7269\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "DANN\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\u3002"}}

This paper reveals the irrationality of indiscriminate inclusion of all models on agents for joint prediction, highlighting the imperative to prioritize quality over quantity in cooperative learning. Specifically, we present the first selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process (GP) regression, namely distributed error-informed GP (EIGP), that enables each agent to assess its neighboring collaborators, using the proposed selection function to choose the higher quality GP models with less prediction errors. Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations.

The framework estimates the share of overruns caused by each stakeholder and the share of overruns they receive as payment. The results show that the share of cost overruns a given stakeholder causes and the share of overruns they receive as payment are often starkly different, which can lead to profit misallocations and litigation between parties, further exacerbating overruns. The magnitude of these potential profit misallocations is examined under three common contract structures - fixed-price, cost-plus, and performance-based - revealing the advantages and disadvantages of each framework for aligning stakeholder incentives.

Submitted to a conference implementing a double-blind review process", "summary": "Recent work shows that fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve high valid plan rates on PDDL planning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting. Our results highlight a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning and provide diagnostic tools for studying its causes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728PDDL\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6709\u9ad8\u6709\u6548\u8ba1\u5212\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u662f\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u8fd8\u662f\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bca\u65ad\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u4f46\u672a\u6539\u5584\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728PDDL\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6709\u6548\u8ba1\u5212\u7387\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u8fd8\u662f\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "method": "\u572840,000\u4e2a\u9886\u57df - \u95ee\u9898 - \u8ba1\u5212\u5143\u7ec4\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c0317\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u57df\u5185\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7b26\u53f7\u533f\u540d\u5316\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u8ba1\u5212\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5956\u52b1\u5fae\u8c03\u4e09\u79cd\u8bca\u65ad\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u57df\u5185\u6709\u6548\u8ba1\u5212\u7387\u8fbe82.9%\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u4e3a0%\uff1b\u7b26\u53f7\u533f\u540d\u5316\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4f7f\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5956\u52b1\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u4e00\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\u8fbe\u5230\u6027\u80fd\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6539\u5584\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In Phase 1, each group selects the position of one of its agents to serve as the group's representative location. In Phase 2, $k$ representatives are chosen as facility locations.

This imbalance can reduce recommendation quality and lead to unfair item exposure. Although existing mitigation methods address this issue to some extent, they often lack transparency in how they operate. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc approach, PopSteer, that leverages a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to both interpret and mitigate popularity bias in recommendation models. The SAE is trained to replicate a trained model's behavior while enabling neuron-level interpretability.

This introduces challenges in scalable cloud deployment and state management. Traditional hosting on Virtual Machines (VMs) is resource-intensive and lacks elasticity. Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer modularity, autoscaling and cost efficiency but are inherently stateless. In this paper, we present the FAME, a FaaS-based architecture for orchestrating MCP-enabled agentic workflows. FAME decomposes agentic patterns such as ReAct into composable agents: Planner, Actor and Evaluator, that are each a FaaS function built using LangGraph and are orchestrated as a FaaS workflow. This enables modular composition as AWS Step Functions and avoids function timeouts seen for monolithic agentic workflows. To address context persistence across user requests in a conversation, FAME automates agent memory persistence and injection using DynamoDB. It also optimizes MCP server deployment through AWS Lambda wrappers, caches tool outputs in S3 and proposes function fusion strategies. We evaluate FAME on two representative applications, on research paper summarization and log analytics, under diverse memory and caching configurations. Results show up to 13x latency reduction, 88% fewer input tokens and 66% in cost savings, along with improved workflow completion rates.

This replenishment-based formulation captures operational settings, such as e-commerce fulfillment, perishable supply chains, and renewable-powered systems, where resources are accumulated gradually and initial inventories are small or zero. The introduction of dispersed, uncertain replenishment fundamentally alters the structure of classical OLPs, creating persistent stockout risk and eliminating advance knowledge of the total budget.\n  We develop new algorithms and regret analyses for three major distributional regimes studied in the OLP literature: bounded distributions, finite-support distributions, and continuous-support distributions with a non-degeneracy condition. For bounded distributions, we design an algorithm that achieves $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. For finite-support distributions with a non-degenerate induced LP, we obtain $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ regret, and we establish an $\u03a9(\\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for degenerate instances, demonstrating a sharp separation from the classical setting where $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ regret is achievable. For continuous-support, non-degenerate distributions, we develop a two-stage accumulate-then-convert algorithm that achieves $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2 T)$ regret, comparable to the $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ regret in classical OLPs.

Quantization in llama.cpp enables large language models to run on commodity hardware, but available formats are often evaluated inconsistently, making it hard to choose among schemes. We present a unified empirical study of the llama.cpp quantization on a single modern model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (FP16, GGUF), covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats. We evaluate downstream task performance across standard reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, and also measure perplexity and CPU throughput (prefill/decoding) alongside model size, compression, and quantization time.

Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u9879\u76ee\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u6d3b\u52a8\u7ec4\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u819d\u70b9\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u6811GP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d3b\u52a8\u7ec4\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u819d\u70b9\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u786e\u5b9a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u6d3b\u52a8\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u6d3b\u52a8\u6392\u5e8f\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5408\u683c\u6d3b\u52a8 - \u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u819d\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u627e\u5230\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5bf9\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528\u7ec4\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u6d3b\u52a8\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u6811GP\u6846\u67b6\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u5316\u4e24\u79cd\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u91c7\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u7684GP\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6d3b\u52a8\u7ec4\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u9879\u76ee\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Program chairs must balance competing objectives, including maximizing reviewer expertise, promoting diversity, and enhancing robustness to strategic manipulation, but it is challenging to do so at the modern conference scale.\n  Existing algorithmic paper assignment approaches either fail to address all of these goals simultaneously or suffer from poor scalability. To address the limitation, we propose Robust Assignment via Marginal Perturbation (RAMP), a unified framework for large-scale peer review.

Instead of training heavy layers to map text to a constrained space, NUMEN uses deterministic character hashing to project language directly onto high-dimensional vectors.

A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy.

To mitigate the risk of ARBs early in the development phase, ARB prediction has been introduced into software aging research. However, due to the difficulty of collecting ARBs, within-project ARB prediction faces the challenge of data scarcity, leading to the proposal of cross-project ARB prediction. This task faces two major challenges: 1) domain adaptation issue caused by distribution difference between source and target projects; and 2) severe class imbalance between ARB-prone and ARB-free samples. Although various methods have been proposed for cross-project ARB prediction, existing approaches treat the input metrics independently and often neglect the rich inter-metric dependencies, which can lead to overlapping information and misjudgment of metric importance, potentially affecting the model's performance. Moreover, they typically use cross-entropy as the loss function during training, which cannot distinguish the difficulty of sample classification. To overcome these limitations, we propose ARFT-Transformer, a transformer-based cross-project ARB prediction framework that introduces a metric-level multi-head attention mechanism to capture metric interactions and incorporates Focal Loss function to effectively handle class imbalance. Experiments conducted on three large-scale open-source projects demonstrate that ARFT-Transformer on average outperforms state-of-the-art cross-project ARB prediction methods in both single-source and multi-source cases, achieving up to a 29.54% and 19.92% improvement in Balance metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8de8\u9879\u76eeARB\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6ARFT - Transformer\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u9879\u76eeARB\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6307\u6807\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faARFT - Transformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u6307\u6807\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Focal Loss\u51fd\u6570\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cARFT - Transformer\u5728\u5355\u6e90\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cBalance\u6307\u6807\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534729.54%\u548c19.92%\u3002", "conclusion": "ARFT - Transformer\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u9879\u76eeARB\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In the United States, these technologies transformed ultra-low permeability shale formations into commercially viable resources, increasing crude oil production from 5 million bpd in 2008 to more than 12 million by 2019. Horizontal drilling became the standard after 2010, with nearly 200,000 horizontal wells completed by the end of 2023, accounting for more than 80% of all new wells in the US. This success is now being replicated in Argentina making the country a leading unconventional producer. The common driver in both cases is the mass manufacturing approach, which industrializes oil production through standardized well designs, repeatable workflows, multi-well pad drilling, and continuous process optimization. Supported by a competitive oilfield service market and a skilled technical workforce, this model has reduced drilling times from months to weeks and cut well costs by half over the past decade. New technologies such as precision geosteering, advanced completion designs, real-time drilling analytics, and cyclic gas injection continue to improve efficiency and productivity. Applying these methods and technologies to conventional reservoirs could significantly expand global production capacity and place sustained downward pressure on crude oil prices. This paper argues that in a period of slowing economic growth and potential financial deleveraging, abundant supply from both unconventional and conventional developments could extend a prolonged phase of relatively low oil prices. Such a scenario would have far-reaching implications for energy policy, investment strategies, and the competitive position of oil-producing nations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9875\u5ca9\u9769\u547d\u91cd\u5851\u6cb9\u6c14\u884c\u4e1a\uff0c\u7f8e\u963f\u501f\u6280\u672f\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u751f\u4ea7\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea7\u91cf\uff0c\u65b0\u79d1\u6280\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6216\u4f7f\u6cb9\u4ef7\u957f\u671f\u4f4e\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u9875\u5ca9\u9769\u547d\u6280\u672f\u53ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u5e94\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u539f\u6cb9\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u963f\u6839\u5ef7\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5236\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u9875\u5ca9\u6cb9\u4ea7\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7f8e\u539f\u6cb9\u4ea7\u91cf\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u963f\u6839\u5ef7\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u6cb9\u751f\u4ea7\u56fd\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u94bb\u4e95\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u6216\u4f7f\u539f\u6cb9\u4f9b\u5e94\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u957f\u671f\u4f4e\u4ef7\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u6e90\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u4ea7\u6cb9\u56fd\u5730\u4f4d\u3002"}}

Here, we present a \"Just-in-Time\" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions.

We develop multi-context principal component analysis (MCPCA), a theoretical and algorithmic framework that decomposes data into factors shared across subsets of contexts. Applied to gene expression, MCPCA reveals axes of variation shared across subsets of cancer types and an axis whose variability in tumor cells, but not mean, is associated with lung cancer progression. Applied to contextualized word embeddings from language models, MCPCA maps stages of a debate on human nature, revealing a discussion between science and fiction over decades.

Yet human judgement remains paramount for high-stakes decision-making. This has fueled explorations of collaborative decision-making between humans and AI systems, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. To explore this dynamic, researchers conduct empirical studies, investigating how humans use AI assistance for decision-making and how this collaboration impacts results. A critical aspect of conducting these studies is the role of participants, often recruited through crowdsourcing platforms. The validity of these studies hinges on the behaviours of the participants, hence effective incentives that can potentially affect these behaviours are a key part of designing and executing these studies. In this work, we aim to address the critical role of incentive design for conducting empirical human-AI decision-making studies, focusing on understanding, designing, and documenting incentive schemes. Through a thematic review of existing research, we explored the current practices, challenges, and opportunities associated with incentive design for human-AI decision-making empirical studies. We identified recurring patterns, or themes, such as what comprises the components of an incentive scheme, how incentive schemes are manipulated by researchers, and the impact they can have on research outcomes. Leveraging the acquired understanding, we curated a set of guidelines to aid researchers in designing effective incentive schemes for their studies, called the Incentive-Tuning Framework, outlining how researchers can undertake, reflect on, and document the incentive design process.

A widely used approach to improve dataset diversity involves generating realistic synthetic traffic scenarios. However, producing such scenarios remains difficult due to the precision required when scripting them manually or generating them in a single pass. Natural language offers a flexible way to describe scenarios, but existing text-to-simulation pipelines often rely on static snippet retrieval, limited grammar, single-pass decoding, or lack robust executability checks. Moreover, they depend heavily on constrained LLM prompting with minimal post-processing. To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE - Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Scenario Engineering, a multi-stage tool that converts natural language prompts into executable Scenic scripts through iterative LLM-guided refinement. After each generation, ARISE tests script executability in simulation software, feeding structured diagnostics back to the LLM until both syntactic and functional requirements are met. This process significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. Through extensive evaluation, ARISE outperforms the baseline in generating semantically accurate and executable traffic scenarios with greater reliability and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5de5\u5177ARISE\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884cScenic\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u5408\u6210\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u5199\u6216\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u3001\u6587\u672c\u5230\u6a21\u62df\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7247\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ARISE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884cScenic\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u540e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u811a\u672c\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6027\u5e76\u5c06\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u9988\u7ed9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "ARISE\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ARISE\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations.

A. M. Dirac articulated a structural tension between two widely affirmed norms: that it is good and natural for parents to improve the prospects of their own children, and that justice requires that all children have equal opportunities in life. These principles, each compelling on its own, cannot be fully realized together. This paper reconstructs Dirac's dilemma, connects it to the dynamics of compounding advantage and inheritance, and situates it within the broader history of political philosophy, including the work of Rawls, Dworkin, Cohen, Brighouse and Swift, Nozick, Murphy and Nagel, and others.

Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

When there are many environments but only a few observations per environment, standard two-sample IV estimators fail to be consistent.

However, the computing power of a single-edge node is limited, and collaborative computing will cause information leakage and excessive communication overhead. In this paper, we design a parallel collaborative distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and propose a three-phase parallel collaborative ADMM privacy computing (3P-ADMM-PC2) algorithm for distributed computing in edge networks, where the Paillier homomorphic encryption is utilized to protect data privacy during interactions. Especially, a quantization method is introduced, which maps the real numbers to a positive integer interval without affecting the homomorphic operations. To address the architectural mismatch between large-integer and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing, we transform high-bitwidth computations into low-bitwidth matrix and vector operations. Thus the GPU can be utilized to implement parallel encryption and decryption computations with long keys. Finally, a GPU-accelerated 3P-ADMM-PC2 is proposed to optimize the collaborative computing tasks. Meanwhile, large-scale computational tasks are conducted in network topologies with varying numbers of edge nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3P-ADMM-PC2 has excellent mean square error performance, which is close to that of distributed ADMM without privacy-preserving.

However, the increasing complexity of microservice architectures leads to exponential growth in the fault-injection space, rendering traditional random injection inefficient. Recent lineage-driven approaches mitigate this problem through heuristic pruning, but they face two limitations. First, combinatorial-fault discovery remains bottlenecked by general-purpose SAT solvers, which fail to exploit the monotone and low-overlap structure of derived CNF formulas and typically rely on a static upper bound on fault size. Second, existing techniques provide limited post-injection guidance beyond reporting detected faults. To address these challenges, we propose FastFI, a fault-injection-guided framework to enhance the robustness of API call sites in microservice-based systems. FastFI features a DFS-based solver with dynamic fault injection to discover all valid combinatorial faults, and it leverages fault-injection results to identify critical APIs whose call sites should be hardened for robustness. Experiments on four representative microservice benchmarks show that FastFI reduces end-to-end fault-injection time by an average of 76.12\\% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining acceptable resource overhead.

Trees can be used to represent RNA secondary structures, which directly relate to the function of non-coding RNAs. Recent developments in sequencing technology and artificial intelligence have yielded numerous biological data that can be represented with tree structures. This requires novel methods for tree structure data analytics. Tree polynomials provide a computationally efficient, interpretable and comprehensive way to encode tree structures as matrices, which are compatible with most data analytics tools. Machine learning methods based on the Canberra distance between tree polynomials have been introduced to analyze phylogenies and nucleic acid structures.

This paper argues that a non-trivial portion of contemporary frictional unemployment is artificially induced by automated recruitment systems that rely on deterministic keyword-based screening.\n  Drawing on labor economics, information asymmetry theory, and prior work on algorithmic hiring, we formalize this phenomenon as artificial frictional unemployment arising from semantic misinterpretation of candidate competencies. We evaluate this claim using controlled simulations that compare legacy keyword-based screening with semantic matching based on high-dimensional vector representations of resumes and job descriptions.\n  The results demonstrate substantial improvements in recall and overall matching efficiency without a corresponding loss in precision. Building on these findings, the paper proposes a candidate-side workforce operating architecture that standardizes, verifies, and semantically aligns human capital signals while remaining interoperable with existing recruitment infrastructure.

Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA.

However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Feedback welcome on DHT incentive models and capability mapping service design", "summary": "Multi-agent systems face a fundamental architectural flaw: agent identity is bound to network location. When agents migrate between providers, scale across instances, or federate across organizations, URI-based identity schemes break references, fragment audit trails, and require centralized coordination. We propose the agent:// URI scheme, which decouples identity from topology through three orthogonal components: a trust root establishing organizational authority, a hierarchical capability path enabling semantic discovery, and a sortable unique identifier providing stable reference. The scheme enables capability-based discovery through DHT key derivation, where queries return agents by what they do rather than where they are. Trust-root scoping prevents cross-organization pollution while permitting federation when desired. Cryptographic attestation via PASETO tokens binds capability claims to agent identity, enabling verification without real-time contact with the issuing authority.

However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy.

To appear in The Web Conference 2026", "summary": "Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is a promising Federated Learning (FL) paradigm designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks due to its discrete, ranking-based update mechanism. Unlike traditional FL methods that rely on model updates, FRL leverages discrete rankings as a communication parameter between clients and the server. This approach significantly reduces communication costs and limits an adversary's ability to scale or optimize malicious updates in the continuous space, thereby enhancing its robustness. This makes FRL particularly appealing for applications where system security and data privacy are crucial, such as web-based auction and bidding platforms. While FRL substantially reduces the attack surface, we demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to a new class of local model poisoning attack, i.e., fine-grained control attacks. We introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), the first fine-grained control attack tailored to ranking-based FL frameworks. Unlike conventional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that cause conspicuous disruptions, ECA enables an adversary to precisely degrade a competitor's accuracy to any target level while maintaining a normal-looking convergence trajectory, thereby avoiding detection. ECA operates in two stages: (i) identifying and manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align the global model with the target model, and (ii) widening the selection boundary gap to stabilize the global model at the target accuracy. Extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets and nine Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs) show that ECA achieves fine-grained accuracy control with an average error of only 0.224%, outperforming the baseline by up to 17x.

Online Q&A forums such as Stack Overflow provide large-scale settings where such explanations are produced and evaluated, offering valuable insights into what makes them effective. While prior work has explored answer acceptance and voting behavior, little is known about which specific features make explanations genuinely useful. The relative influence of structural, contextual, and linguistic factors, such as content richness, timing, and sentiment, remains unclear. We analyzed 3,323 questions and 59,398 answers from Stack Overflow, combining text analysis and statistical modeling to examine how explanation attributes relate to perceived usefulness (normalized upvotes). Structural and contextual factors, especially explanation length, code inclusion, timing, and author reputation, show small to moderate positive effects. Sentiment polarity has negligible influence, suggesting that clarity and substance outweigh tone in technical communication. This study provides an empirical account of what drives perceived usefulness in developer explanations. It contributes methodological transparency through open data and replication materials, and conceptual insight by relating observed communication patterns to principles of requirements communication. The findings offer evidence-based implications for how developers and RE practitioners can craft clearer and more effective explanations, potentially supporting fairer communication in both open and organizational contexts.

A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\\%$ detection rate.

Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u672c\u5730\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u5b9a\u6027\u6587\u672c\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff0cPhi\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u542b\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u533f\u540d\u5316\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u9057\u6f0f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u9700\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6846\u67b6SFAA\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u533f\u540d\u5316\u4e09\u6b65\uff0c\u6709\u56db\u79cd\u533f\u540d\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u56fd\u9645\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4f26\u7406\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u53cc\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLaMA\u548cPhi\u4e24\u4e2a\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff0cPhi\u627e\u5230\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u4e8eLLaMA\uff0c\u4f46\u9519\u8bef\u7565\u591a\uff0c\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u8d8591%\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff0c94.8%\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u6587\u60c5\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images.

This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship.

We tested this method in a large C++ project, resulting in a 92.73% acceptance rate of the fixes by human developers during the code review. Our LLM-generated fixes reduced the number of warning fix changes that introduced additional instructions due to range checks and exception handling by 39.09% compared to a baseline fix strategy. This result was 13.56% behind the optimal solutions created by human developers.

Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{\u03b5+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs.

Unlike classical trust-region methods, the proposed algorithm relies solely on stochastic gradient information and does not require function value evaluations. The trust-region radius is adaptively adjusted based on a radius-control parameter and the stochastic gradient estimate. Under mild assumptions, we establish that the algorithm converges in expectation to a first-order stationary point. Moreover, the method achieves iteration and sample complexity bounds that match those of SVRG-based first-order methods, while allowing stochastic and potentially gradient-dependent second-order information. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that incorporating SVRG accelerates convergence, and that the use of trust-region methods and Hessian information further improves performance.

This unknown permutation is a key component of the data-generating process, yet its statistical investigation remains challenging due to its discrete nature. In this study, we develop a general statistical inference framework on the permutation and regression coefficients. First, we introduce a localization step that reduces the permutation space to a small candidate set building on recent advances in the repro samples method, whose miscoverage decays polynomially with the number of Monte Carlo samples. Then, based on this localized set, we provide statistical inference procedures: a conditional Monte Carlo test of permutation structures with valid finite-sample Type-I error control. We also develop coefficient inference that remains valid under alignment uncertainty of permutations. For computational purposes, we develop a linear assignment problem computable in polynomial time complexity and demonstrate that its solution asymptotically converges to that of the conventional least squares problem with large computational cost.

We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a principled, multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

However, its perfor- mance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio?\n  To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quanti- fying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achiev- ing effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups.\n  Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log com- pressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mecha- nism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u65e5\u5fd7\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1DeLog\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u538b\u7f29\u5728\u590d\u6742\u751f\u4ea7\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u7136\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1DeLog\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b7e\u540d\u5408\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u597d\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u7f16\u7801\uff1bDeLog\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e5\u5fd7\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u7f16\u7801\uff0cDeLog\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Additionally, the models trained in one domain are not applicable to other domains, necessitating the need for cross-domain adaptation (such as HDFS and Linux). Traditional detection models often fail to generalize due to significant data drift and the inherent absence of labeled anomalies in new target domains. To handle the above challenges, we proposed a new end-to-end framework based on a meta-learning approach. Our methodology first gets the data ready by combining a Drain3 log parsing mechanism with a dynamic drift-based labeling technique that uses semantic and fuzzy matching to move existing anomaly knowledge from one source to another. BERT-based semantic embeddings are obtained, and the feature selection is invoked to reduce the dimensionality. Later, Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Prototypical Networks models are trained to adapt quickly and effectively. The SMOTE oversampling method is employed to handle imbalances in the data. All the results are obtained by employing the leave-one-out source method, and the corresponding mean F1 scores are reported.

In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation.

Deep convolutional and attention based models achieve strong in distribution performance on DNA regulatory sequence prediction tasks but are usually evaluated under i.i.d. assumptions, even though real applications involve cell type specific programs, evolutionary turnover, assay protocol changes, and sequencing artifacts. We introduce a robustness framework that combines a mechanistic simulation benchmark with real data analysis on a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) dataset to quantify performance degradation, calibration failures, and uncertainty based reliability. In simulation, motif driven regulatory outputs are generated with cell type specific programs, PWM perturbations, GC bias, depth variation, batch effects, and heteroscedastic noise, and CNN, BiLSTM, and transformer models are evaluated. Models remain accurate and reasonably calibrated under mild GC content shifts but show higher error, severe variance miscalibration, and coverage collapse under motif effect rewiring and noise dominated regimes, revealing robustness gaps invisible to standard i.i.d. evaluation. Adding simple biological structural priors motif derived features in simulation and global GC content in MPRA improves in distribution error and yields consistent robustness gains under biologically meaningful genomic shifts, while providing only limited protection against strong assay noise.

However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning.

However, most existing deep learning approaches treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. In addition, standard attention mechanisms are often sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability. We present DiSPA, a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. DiSPA introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions. Across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting, which assesses generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations. Beyond predictive accuracy, DiSPA yields mechanistically informative representations: learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiSPA trained solely on bulk RNA-seq data enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining. Together, these results establish DiSPA as a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDiSPA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u89e3\u8026\u836f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u6291\u5236\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6709\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u7f51\u7edc\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u836f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiSPA\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5316\u5b66\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u901a\u8def\u6c34\u5e73\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u8c03\u8282\u89e3\u8026\u836f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728GDSC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u4ea4\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u5df2\u77e5\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u7b49\uff0c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6279\u91cfRNA - seq\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684DiSPA\u80fd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "DiSPA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6574\u5408\u836f\u7269\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5bf9\u836f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544aAIGB\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGRPO - Adaptive\u548cDARA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u53ca\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0cLLM\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u7d2f\u79ef\u4ef7\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GRPO - Adaptive\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDARA\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u548cAIGB\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints.

However, existing formulations rely on \\textit{deterministic} regression objectives, which mask probabilistic semantics and limit its applicability in stochastic control. In this work, we introduce \\emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \\textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \\emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVariational JEPA (VJEPA)\u548cBayesian JEPA (BJEPA)\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709JEPA\u5728\u968f\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5608\u6742\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709JEPA\u4f9d\u8d56\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u6982\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u968f\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VJEPA\u5b66\u4e60\u672a\u6765\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51faBJEPA\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "result": "VJEPA\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0ePSR\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5145\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u72b6\u6001\uff1bVJEPA\u548cBJEPA\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5e72\u6270\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "VJEPA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u5608\u6742\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Most existing unsupervised summarization methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance keyframe selection and generate coherent, video summaries through adversarial training. However, such approaches primarily exploit unimodal features, overlooking the guiding role of semantic information in keyframe selection, and often suffer from unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method. Specifically, we design a novel frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism and integrate it into a keyframe selector, which guides the Transformer-based generator within the adversarial framework to better reconstruct videos.

For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker.

Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Cir\u00e9 and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \\mid r_j, d_j, \\bar{d}_j \\mid \\sum E_j + \\sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Cir\u00e9 and van Hoeve.

In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9GitHub\u4e0a33k\u4e2a\u7531\u4e94\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u521b\u5efa\u7684PR\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u5408\u5e76\u4e0e\u672a\u5408\u5e76PR\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790600\u4e2aPR\u5f97\u51fa\u62d2\u7edd\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u8d21\u732e\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u8bb8\u591aPR\u672a\u88ab\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u4e86\u89e3\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5bf933k\u4e2aPR\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u6539\u3001CI\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u52a8\u6001\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u533a\u5206\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u672a\u5408\u5e76PR\uff1b\u5bf9600\u4e2aPR\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u51fa\u62d2\u7edd\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u6863\u3001CI\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684PR\u5408\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4fee\u590dbug\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u5dee\uff1b\u672a\u5408\u5e76PR\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u6539\u5927\u3001\u6d89\u53ca\u6587\u4ef6\u591a\u4e14\u5e38\u4e0d\u901a\u8fc7CI/CD\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u672a\u6db5\u76d6\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u672a\u6765\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6210\u529f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

We introduce MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents. The resulting architecture maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts. Across two canonical benchmarks, MSR-HINE yields substantial gains over a U-Net autoregressive baseline: on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky it reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400 and improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extending the ACC >= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps; on Lorenz-96 it reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100 and improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extending the ACC >= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165MSR - HINE\u5206\u5c42\u9690\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u65f6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4U - Net\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u65f6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u8bef\u5dee\u5feb\u901f\u653e\u5927\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c0f\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u7d2f\u79ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MSR - HINE\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u901f\u7387\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u5355\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7ec6\u5316\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u540e\u9a8c\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6821\u6b63\u5bf9\u9f50\u5faa\u73af\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Kuramoto - Sivashinsky\u548cLorenz - 96\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMSR - HINE\u6bd4U - Net\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5982\u964d\u4f4eRMSE\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8ACC\u548c\u5ef6\u957f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6b65\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "MSR - HINE\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u5728\u6162\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5feb\u901f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u6df7\u6c8c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, extensive research has focused on enhancing model grounding capabilities through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning. However, rather than compelling agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, we propose constructing interaction interfaces specifically optimized for agents. This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the CI4A-based agent significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a new SoTA task success rate of 86.3%, alongside substantial improvements in execution efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faComponent Interface for Agent (CI4A) \u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f51\u9875\u7ec4\u4ef6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u57fa\u4e8eCI4A\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u7f51\u9875\u7ec4\u4ef6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u754c\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CI4A\uff0c\u5c06UI\u7ec4\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u903b\u8f91\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5de5\u5177\u539f\u8bed\uff1b\u5728Ant Design\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0CI4A\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u96c6\u6210CI4A\u7684Ant Design\u91cd\u6784\u5347\u7ea7WebArena\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eCI4A\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe86.3%\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CI4A\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u7ec4\u4ef6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software. We collected and analyzed 1,187 bug-related posts and code snippets from Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Hugging Face forums, focused on LLM agents built with seven widely used LLM frameworks as well as custom implementations.

Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space.

We ask whether an adversarial perturbation provides a representative estimate of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event.

Using this framework, we study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk by proposing an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise.

To address these issues, we present UniCon, a lightweight framework that standardizes states, control flow, and instrumentation across platforms. It decomposes workflows into execution graphs with reusable components, separating system states from control logic to enable plug-and-play deployment across various robot morphologies. Unlike traditional middleware, it prioritizes efficiency through batched, vectorized data flow, minimizing communication overhead and improving inference latency.

We denote these indirect paths between token pairs as their runways. We argue that certain failure modes of causal transformers as observed by a growing body of recent works are likely exacerbated by a misalignment between these two information propagation modes. We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation. Our proposed methodology introduces no additional parameters and can seamlessly be integrated into standard attention mechanism.

Recent work has explored updating the proposal model at test time [arXiv:2511.23473], but the update strategy is still typically hand-specified. Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker \"Implications\" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed \"Implications\" and approached the strongest human-designed \"Rewrite\" baseline without surpassing it. Further analysis of collapse in the model's exploration revealed that a naive archive can confer some short-term robustness but can also accelerate homogenization, suggesting that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently advance beyond carefully optimized human strategies.

We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison.

The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for understanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi-behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional transformers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behavior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, TGA has been deployed in a large-scale industrial production environment, where it leads to impressive improvements in key business metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51faTGA\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u987a\u5e8f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTransition - Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA)\uff0c\u4ece\u7269\u54c1\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u90bb\u5c45\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fc7\u6e21\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "TGA\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u5173\u952e\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "TGA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods.

In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods.

Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5QMC\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u578b\u5f02\u6784\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u8bbe\u5907\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u9002\u5408LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5185\u5b58\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOutlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC)\uff0c\u8bc6\u522bSLM\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u70b9\u548c\u5916\u70b9\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u70b9\u6743\u91cd\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u7535\u963b\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\u5b58\u53d6\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\uff08ReRAM\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u5173\u952e\u5916\u70b9\u4fdd\u7559\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7247\u4e0a\u78c1\u963b\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\u5b58\u53d6\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\uff08MRAM\uff09\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cQMC\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e76\u5339\u914d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3002\u4e0e\u6700\u65b0\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cQMC\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "QMC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.\n  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.\n  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.\n  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u96c6\u6210\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u5b58\u5728\u8d23\u4efb\u5f52\u5c5e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8d23\u4efb\u771f\u7a7a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6210\u56e0\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u8d23\u4efb\u771f\u7a7a\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u4ee3CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u8d23\u4efb\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5f52\u5c5e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u8d23\u4efb\u771f\u7a7a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6807\u51c6\u90e8\u7f72\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7814\u7a76CI\u653e\u5927\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc7\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u9608\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u8d23\u4efb\u771f\u7a7a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u8d23\u4efb\u771f\u7a7a\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u3002"}}

In this technical note, we provide a stratified \"task space\" characterization of the MITRE ATT&CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level. The models also meet or surpass state-of-the-art performance while relying only on classical machine learning methods -- removing any dependence on LLMs, RAG, agents, or more complex hierarchical approaches.

However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module.

Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of \"intent deviation\" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a \"Real-to-Virtual\" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses.

Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CF generation using large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 (zero-shot and few-shot) and two open-source models-BioMistral-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, in both pretrained and fine-tuned configurations. Using the multimodal AI-READI clinical dataset, we assess CFs across three dimensions: intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness. Fine-tuned LLMs, particularly LLaMA-3.1-8B, produce CFs with high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and realistic, behaviorally modifiable feature adjustments. When used for data augmentation under controlled label-scarcity settings, LLM-generated CFs substantially restore classifier performance, yielding an average 20% F1 recovery across three scarcity scenarios. Compared with optimization-based baselines such as DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, LLMs offer a flexible, model-agnostic approach that generates more clinically actionable and semantically coherent counterfactuals.

We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a \"compositional bridge\", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests.

We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \\mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\u03c0(a \\mid v, \\ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization.

To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems.

Most existing search-based symbolic regression methods typically rely on the fitting error to inform the search process. However, in the vast expression space, numerous candidate expressions may exhibit similar error values while differing substantially in structure, leading to ambiguous search directions and hindering convergence to the underlying true function. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget.

Here we introduce a formal framework for meta-evaluation by defining the evaluation space, its structured representation, and a benchmark we call AxiaBench. AxiaBench enables the first large-scale, quantitative comparison of ten widely used evaluation methods across eight representative application domains. Our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation: no existing method simultaneously achieves accuracy and efficiency across diverse scenarios, with DoE and observational designs in particular showing significant deviations from real-world ground truth. We further evaluate a unified method of entire-space stratified sampling from previous evaluatology research, and the results report that it consistently outperforms prior approaches across all tested domains. These results establish meta-evaluation as a scientific object in its own right and provide both a conceptual foundation and a pragmatic tool set for advancing trustworthy evaluation in computational and experimental research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5143\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u548cAxiaBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5c42\u62bd\u6837\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u5143\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e38\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u548cAxiaBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5341\u79cd\u5e38\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9a\u91cf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5c42\u62bd\u6837\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0cDoE\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u51b5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5c42\u62bd\u6837\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786e\u7acb\u5143\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u63a8\u8fdb\u53ef\u4fe1\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u5ff5\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u3002"}}

However, existing GU methods lack a clear understanding of the key factors that determine unlearning effectiveness, leading to three fundamental limitations: (1) impractical and inaccurate GU difficulty assessment due to test-access requirements and invalid assumptions, (2) ineffectiveness on hard-to-unlearn tasks, and (3) misaligned evaluation protocols that overemphasize easy tasks and fail to capture true forgetting capability. To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements. Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6MGU\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5f71\u54cd\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6e05\u6670\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u56f0\u96be\u4e0d\u5b9e\u9645\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u96be\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5GNN\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e3a\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMGU\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5efa\u7acb\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMGU\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7528\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "MGU\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

RAG architecture significantly enhances the chatbots reliability by providing accurate, context-aware responses while mitigating common challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and misinformation. The AI chatbot serves a dual purpose: it enables students to access accurate, ondemand academic support and assists educators in the rapid creation of relevant educational materials. This dual functionality promotes learner autonomy and streamlines the instructional design process.

However, current safety evaluations in this field are mostly limited to detecting whether LLMs output prohibited words in single-turn conversations, neglecting the gradual erosion of safety boundaries in long dialogues. Examples include making definitive guarantees, assuming responsibility, and playing professional roles. We believe that with the evolution of mainstream LLMs, words with obvious safety risks are easily filtered by their underlying systems, while the real danger lies in the gradual transgression of boundaries during multi-turn interactions, driven by the LLM's attempts at comfort and empathy.\n  This paper proposes a multi-turn stress testing framework and conducts long-dialogue safety tests on three cutting-edge LLMs using two pressure methods: static progression and adaptive probing. We generated 50 virtual patient profiles and stress-tested each model through up to 20 rounds of virtual psychiatric dialogues. The experimental results show that violations are common, and both pressure modes produced similar violation rates. However, adaptive probing significantly advanced the time at which models crossed boundaries, reducing the average number of turns from 9.21 in static progression to 4.64. Under both mechanisms, making definitive or zero-risk promises was the primary way in which boundaries were breached. These findings suggest that the robustness of LLM safety boundaries cannot be inferred solely through single-turn tests; it is necessary to fully consider the wear and tear on safety boundaries caused by different interaction pressures and characteristics in extended dialogues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u5355\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8f6e\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e09\u6b3e\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0\u8fdd\u89c4\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a2\u6d4b\u4f7f\u8d8a\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u524d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5355\u8f6e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u80fd\u63a8\u65ad\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fdd\u7981\u8bcd\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u9010\u6e10\u4fb5\u8680\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8f6e\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u9759\u6001\u9012\u8fdb\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e24\u79cd\u538b\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e09\u6b3e\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u8fbe20\u8f6e\u7684\u865a\u62df\u7cbe\u795e\u79d1\u5bf9\u8bdd\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u8fdd\u89c4\u60c5\u51b5\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u538b\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a2\u6d4b\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u524d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8f6e\u6570\u4ece9.21\u51cf\u81f34.64\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u505a\u660e\u786e\u6216\u96f6\u98ce\u9669\u627f\u8bfa\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u8d8a\u754c\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8f6e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63a8\u65ad\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\u538b\u529b\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u635f\u8017\u3002"}}

Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFSX\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u91caGNN\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6d88\u606f\u6d41\u4e0e\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u77ed\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u504f\u79bb\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFSX\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6d88\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u5b50\u56fe\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u611f\u77e5\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u8bc4\u4f30\u8282\u70b9\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cGNN\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cFSX\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "FSX\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u903b\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6df1\u523b\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5173\u952e\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Prototype-based FL mitigates this issue by exchanging class-wise feature prototypes instead of full model parameters; however, existing methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints. In this paper, we propose RefProtoFL, a communication-efficient FL framework that integrates External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) for representation consistency with Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) for communication efficiency. Specifically, we decompose the model into a private backbone and a lightweight shared adapter, and restrict federated communication to the adapter parameters only. To further reduce uplink cost, APUD performs magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification, transmitting only the most significant adapter updates for server-side aggregation. To address representation inconsistency across heterogeneous clients, ERPA leverages a small server-held public dataset to construct external reference prototypes that serve as shared semantic anchors. For classes covered by public data, clients directly align local representations to public-induced prototypes, whereas for uncovered classes, alignment relies on server-aggregated global reference prototypes via weighted averaging.

However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic \"mechanism shift\" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08ARMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08MDMs\uff09\u53ef\u514b\u670d\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6269\u6563\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u91cd\u7ec4\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u975e\u987a\u5e8f\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5c06ARMs\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3aMDMs\u8fd9\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684MDMs\u662f\u5426\u83b7\u5f97\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9ARMs\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684MDMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u201c\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u53d8\u201d\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u540cMDMs\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4eceARMs\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3aMDMs\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8fd8\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u91cd\u7ec4\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u975e\u987a\u5e8f\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point.

To address this, we propose a hallucination-free multi-agent generation framework that breaks down MCQ generation into discrete, verifiable stages. Our framework utilizes both rule-based and LLM-based detection agents, as well as hallucination scoring metrics to optimize question quality. We redefined MCQ generation as an optimization task minimizing hallucination risk while maximizing validity, answerability, and cost-efficiency. We also introduce an agent-led refinement process that uses counterfactual reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) to iteratively improve hallucination in question generation. We evaluated a sample of AP- aligned STEM questions, where our system reduced hallucination rates by over 90% compared to baseline generation while preserving the educational value and style of questions.

This paper introduces a reflection-in-reflection framework for automated generation of reflection questions with large language models (LLMs). Our approach coordinates two role-specialized agents, a Student-Teacher and a Teacher-Educator, that engage in a Socratic multi-turn dialogue to iteratively refine a single question given a teacher-specified topic, key concepts, student level, and optional instructional materials. The Student-Teacher proposes candidate questions with brief rationales, while the Teacher-Educator evaluates them along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding only with targeted coaching questions or a fixed signal to stop the dialogue. We evaluate the framework in an authentic lower-secondary ICT setting on the topic, using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone model and a stronger GPT- 4-class LLM as an external evaluator in pairwise comparisons of clarity, relevance, depth, and overall quality. First, we study how interaction design and context (dynamic vs.fixed iteration counts; presence or absence of student level and materials) affect question quality. Dynamic stopping combined with contextual information consistently outperforms fixed 5- or 10-step refinement, with very long dialogues prone to drift or over-complication. Second, we show that our two-agent protocol produces questions that are judged substantially more relevant and deeper, and better overall, than a one-shot baseline using the same backbone model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u601d\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u601d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u597d\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u6559\u5b66\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u6559\u5e08\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u601d\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u5b66\u751f - \u6559\u5e08\u548c\u6559\u5e08 - \u6559\u80b2\u8005\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u82cf\u683c\u62c9\u5e95\u5f0f\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b8c\u5584\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7528GPT - 4o - mini\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff0cGPT - 4 - class\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u52a8\u6001\u505c\u6b62\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6b65\u6570\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\uff1b\u53cc\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u8bae\u751f\u6210\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This problem is particularly amenable to kernel-based learning methods, where the distributions or samples are first embedded into a Hilbert space, often using kernel mean embeddings (KMEs), and then a standard kernel method like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is applied, using a kernel defined on the embedding Hilbert space. In this work, we contribute to the theoretical analysis of this latter approach, with a particular focus on classification with distributional inputs using SVMs. We establish a new oracle inequality and derive consistency and learning rate results. Furthermore, for SVMs using the hinge loss and Gaussian kernels, we formulate a novel variant of an established noise assumption from the binary classification literature, under which we can establish learning rates.

These AI models, fueled by vast amounts of data and computational prowess, have unlocked remarkable capabilities, from human-like text generation to assisting with natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. They have quickly become the foundation upon which countless applications and software services are being built, or at least being augmented with. However, as with any groundbreaking innovations, the rise of LLMs brings forth critical safety, privacy, and ethical concerns. These models are found to have a propensity to leak private information, produce false information, and can be coerced into generating content that can be used for nefarious purposes by bad actors, or even by regular users unknowingly. Implementing safeguards and guardrailing techniques is imperative for applications to ensure that the content generated by LLMs are safe, secure, and ethical.

We evaluate sdLM using (i) expert-panel scoring of strategic scenarios (N=47), (ii) doctrine consistency on 336 doctrine publications (12,847 statements), and (iii) geopolitical forecasting on 127 historical counterfactuals (1945-2020) across 12-60 month horizons. Across these benchmarks, sdLM achieves higher strategic quality and better calibration than strong general-purpose LLM baselines, and remains competitive with human experts on long-horizon judgments.

Nevertheless, current IoT IDS systems are usually traded off with detection quality, model elucidability, and computational effectiveness, thus the deployment on IoT devices. The present paper counteracts these difficulties by suggesting an explainable AI (XAI) framework based on an optimized Decision Tree classifier with both local and global importance methods: SHAP values that estimate feature attribution using local explanations, and Morris sensitivity analysis that identifies the feature importance in a global view. The proposed system attains the state of art on the test performance with 99.91% accuracy, F1-score of 99.51% and Cohen Kappa of 0.9960 and high stability is confirmed by a cross validation mean accuracy of 98.93%. Efficiency is also enhanced in terms of computations to provide faster inferences compared to those that are generalized in ensemble models. SrcMac has shown as the most significant predictor in feature analyses according to SHAP and Morris methods. Compared to the previous work, our solution eliminates its major drawback lack because it allows us to apply it to edge devices and, therefore, achieve real-time processing, adhere to the new regulation of transparency in AI, and achieve high detection rates on attacks of dissimilar classes.

To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets.

With the growing adoption of wearable glucose monitors and mobile health applications, accurate blood glucose prediction is essential for enhancing automated insulin delivery and decision-support systems. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for personalized blood glucose prediction, leveraging patient-specific data to improve prediction accuracy and responsiveness in real-world scenarios. Unlike traditional generalized models, our method accounts for individual variability, enabling more effective subject-specific predictions. We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics. Results show that personalized models significantly improve the prediction of adverse events, enabling more precise and timely interventions in real-world scenarios. To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to investigate model performance with progressively smaller training sets, identifying the minimum data required for effective personalization-an essential consideration for real-world applications where extensive data collection is often challenging.

However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \\emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6570\u4e14\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u672c\u5730\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5e26\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bc1\u636e\u878d\u5408\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728RGB - \u6df1\u5ea6\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6570\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u9000\u5316\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This mechanism forces the robot to execute K-step action sequences, allowing per-step perturbations to accumulate through integration. We propose SILENTDRIFT, a stealthy black-box backdoor attack exploiting this vulnerability. Our method employs the Smootherstep function to construct perturbations with guaranteed C2 continuity, ensuring zero velocity and acceleration at trajectory boundaries to satisfy strict kinematic consistency constraints.

Existing multimodal rumor detection methods improve cross modal modeling but suffer from limited feature extraction, noisy alignment, and inflexible fusion strategies, while ignoring external factual evidence necessary for verifying complex rumors. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal rumor detection model enhanced with external evidence and forgery features. The model uses a ResNet34 visual encoder, a BERT text encoder, and a forgery feature module extracting frequency-domain traces and compression artifacts via Fourier transformation. BLIP-generated image descriptions bridge image and text semantic spaces. A dual contrastive learning module computes contrastive losses between text image and text description pairs, improving detection of semantic inconsistencies.

However, designing effective curricula remains a difficult problem, particularly in settings where small subsets of environment parameterisations result in significant increases in the complexity of the required policy. Current methods struggle with a difficult credit assignment problem and rely on regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, both of which are compounded as the size of the environment grows. We propose Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen) to enable a denser level generator reward signal, reducing the difficulty of credit assignment and allowing for UED to scale to larger environment sizes.

While effective, this paradigm struggles to incorporate contextual features and fails to capture semantic relationships among classes. To address these limitations, we propose InstructTime, a novel framework that reformulates time series classification as a multimodal generative task. Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration.

We introduce FG-Trac, a model-agnostic framework that establishes verifiable, fine-grained sample-level traceability throughout machine learning pipelines. FG-Trac defines an explicit mechanism for capturing and verifying sample lifecycle events across preprocessing and training, computes contribution scores explicitly grounded in training checkpoints, and anchors these traces to tamper-evident cryptographic commitments. The framework integrates without modifying model architectures or training objectives, reconstructing complete and auditable data-usage histories with practical computational overhead.

One of the main challenges associated with this task is the frequent substitutions that occur during a game, which results in highly sparse data. In particular, a National Basketball Association (NBA) team will use more than 600 lineups during a season, which translates to an average lineup having seen the court in approximately 25-30 possessions. Inevitably, any statistics that one collects for these lineups are going to be noisy, with low predictive value. Yet, there is no existing work (in the public at least) that addresses this problem. In this work, we propose a regression-based approach that controls for the opposition faced by each lineup, while it also utilizes information about the players making up the lineups. Our experiments show that L-RAPM provides improved predictive power than the currently used baseline, and this improvement increases as the sample size for the lineups gets smaller.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7bee\u7403\u9635\u5bb9\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4f4e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7bee\u7403\u9635\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u56e0\u6bd4\u8d5b\u9891\u7e41\u6362\u4eba\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u4ef7\u503c\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u516c\u5f00\u7814\u7a76\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5L - RAPM\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9635\u5bb9\u9762\u5bf9\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u6210\u9635\u5bb9\u7684\u7403\u5458\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "L - RAPM\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u9635\u5bb9\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u53d8\u5c0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7bee\u7403\u9635\u5bb9\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We posit that we can reuse a common corporate organizational structure: teams of independent AI agents with strict role boundaries can work with common goals, but opposing incentives. Multiple models serving as a team of rivals can catch and minimize errors within the final product at a small cost to the velocity of actions. In this paper we demonstrate that we can achieve reliability without acquiring perfect components, but through careful orchestration of imperfect ones.\n  This paper describes the architecture of such a system in practice: specialized agent teams (planners, executors, critics, experts), organized into an organization with clear goals, coordinated through a remote code executor that keeps data transformations and tool invocations separate from reasoning models. Rather than agents directly calling tools and ingesting full responses, they write code that executes remotely; only relevant summaries return to agent context. By preventing raw data and tool outputs from contaminating context windows, the system maintains clean separation between perception (brains that plan and reason) and execution (hands that perform heavy data transformations and API calls). We demonstrate the approach achieves over 90% internal error interception prior to user exposure while maintaining acceptable latency tradeoffs.

While recursion is precisely defined in mathematics and computer science, it has not previously been formalized as an aesthetic paradigm. Recursivism designates practices in which not only outputs vary over time, but in which the generative process itself becomes capable of reflexive modification through its own effects.\n  The paper develops a five-level analytical scale distinguishing simple iteration, cumulative iteration, parametric recursion, reflexive recursion, and meta-recursion. This scale clarifies the threshold at which a system shifts from variation within a fixed rule to genuine self-modification of the rule itself. From this perspective, art history is reinterpreted as a recursive dynamic alternating between internal recursion within movements and meta-recursive transformations of their generative principles.\n  Artificial intelligence renders this logic technically explicit through learning loops, parameter updates, and code-level self-modification. To distinguish Recursivism from related notions such as generative art, cybernetics, process art, and evolutionary art, the article proposes three operational criteria: state memory, rule evolvability, and reflexive visibility. These concepts are examined through case studies including Refik Anadol, Sougwen Chung, Karl Sims, and the Darwin-Godel Machine. The article concludes by examining the aesthetic, curatorial, and ethical implications of self-modifying artistic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5f15\u5165\u9012\u5f52\u4e3b\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u65f6\u4ee3\u827a\u672f\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u63a2\u8ba8\u81ea\u4fee\u6539\u827a\u672f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u6982\u5ff5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7f8e\u5b66\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u65f6\u4ee3\u827a\u672f\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6807\u51c6\u533a\u5206\u9012\u5f52\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c4\u5219\u5185\u53d8\u5316\u5230\u89c4\u5219\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u8bfb\u827a\u672f\u53f2\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u9012\u5f52\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u81ea\u4fee\u6539\u827a\u672f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7f8e\u5b66\u3001\u7b56\u5c55\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Key features of open science, defined here as data and code availability, are difficult to extract due to the inherent complexity of the field. Previous work has either been limited to small-scale studies due to the labor-intensive nature of manual analysis or has relied on large-scale bibliometric approaches that sacrifice contextual richness. This paper introduces an automatic and scalable feature-extraction pipeline to measure data and code availability in transportation research. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task and validate their performance against a manually curated dataset and through an inter-rater agreement analysis. We applied this pipeline to examine 10,724 research articles published in the Transportation Research Part series of journals between 2019 and 2024. Our analysis found that only 5% of quantitative papers shared a code repository, 4% of quantitative papers shared a data repository, and about 3% of papers shared both, with trends differing across journals, topics, and geographic regions. We found no significant difference in citation counts or review duration between papers that provided data and code and those that did not, suggesting a misalignment between open science efforts and traditional academic metrics. Consequently, encouraging these practices will likely require structural interventions from journals and funding agencies to supplement the lack of direct author incentives. The pipeline developed in this study can be readily scaled to other journals, representing a critical step toward the automated measurement and monitoring of open science practices in transportation research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u81ea\u52a8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u7ba1\u9053\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u4ea4\u901a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u8df5\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u672f\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u671f\u520a\u548c\u8d44\u52a9\u673a\u6784\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u8df5\u72b6\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u52a8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u5de5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u5217\u671f\u520a\u6587\u7ae0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4ec55%\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bba\u6587\u5171\u4eab\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff0c4%\u5171\u4eab\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c3%\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u8d8b\u52bf\u56e0\u671f\u520a\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u4e0e\u672a\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5728\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u52aa\u529b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u672f\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u671f\u520a\u548c\u8d44\u52a9\u673a\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than the dense baseline while maintaining balanced expert utilization through regularization, avoiding expert collapse. To analyze generalization, we compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics at convergence, including the largest eigenvalue and trace of the loss Hessian, evaluated on both training and test data. We find that SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness by these metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE lie in a similar curvature regime, despite all models achieving comparable generalization performance. Complementary loss surface perturbation analyses reveal qualitative differences in non-local behavior under finite parameter perturbations between dense and MoE models, which help contextualize curvature-based measurements without directly explaining validation accuracy. We further evaluate empirical inference efficiency and show that naively implemented conditional routing does not yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale, highlighting the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76MoE\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5934\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7b49\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80MoE\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6b64\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5728CIFAR10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4Dense\u3001SoftMoE\u548cSparseMoE\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5934\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97Hessian\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9510\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u9762\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cdMoE\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7565\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u5e73\u8861\uff1bSoftMoE\u9510\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0cDense\u548cSparseMoE\u66f2\u7387\u76f8\u4f3c\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u6734\u7d20\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8def\u7531\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MoE\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u7a00\u758fMoE\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems.

GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations.

Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields.

Our dataset combines spectral data from 12 different channels, including infrared (IR), short-wave IR (SWIR), and thermal. We take imagery from 20 wildfire missions and randomly sample small patches to generate over 4000 images with high variability, including occlusions by smoke/clouds, easily-confused false positives, and nighttime imagery.\n  We demonstrate results from a deep-learning model to automate the human-intensive process of fire perimeter determination. We train two deep neural networks, one for image classification and the other for pixel-level segmentation. The networks are combined into a unique real-time segmentation model to efficiently localize active wildfire on an incoming image feed. Our model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union(IoU), and 84% recall surpassing past methods, including models trained on satellite data and classical color-rule algorithms. By leveraging a multi-spectral dataset, our model is able to detect active wildfire at nighttime and behind clouds, while distinguishing between false positives. We find that data from the SWIR, IR, and thermal bands is the most important to distinguish fire perimeters.

To systematically assess this discrepancy, we introduce an interpretable, information-theoretic framework for auditing unlearning using Partial Information Decomposition (PID). By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks.

However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops.

Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive gradient descent to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of \"simple examples\": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible.

However, current LLMs often generate plausible-looking but ineffective ideas. Execution grounding may help, but it is unclear whether automated execution is feasible and whether LLMs can learn from the execution feedback. To investigate these, we first build an automated executor to implement ideas and launch large-scale parallel GPU experiments to verify their effectiveness. We then convert two realistic research problems - LLM pre-training and post-training - into execution environments and demonstrate that our automated executor can implement a large fraction of the ideas sampled from frontier LLMs. We analyze two methods to learn from the execution feedback: evolutionary search and reinforcement learning. Execution-guided evolutionary search is sample-efficient: it finds a method that significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline (69.4% vs 48.0%) on post-training, and finds a pre-training recipe that outperforms the nanoGPT baseline (19.7 minutes vs 35.9 minutes) on pre-training, all within just ten search epochs. Frontier LLMs often generate meaningful algorithmic ideas during search, but they tend to saturate early and only occasionally exhibit scaling trends. Reinforcement learning from execution reward, on the other hand, suffers from mode collapse. It successfully improves the average reward of the ideator model but not the upper-bound, due to models converging on simple ideas.

To achieve this, decision-makers need to approximate what decision they would have made had they not known certain facts, such as the gender or race of a job candidate. This counterfactual self-simulation is notoriously hard for humans, leading to biased judgments even by well-meaning actors. Here we show that large language models (LLMs) suffer from similar limitations in their ability to approximate what decisions they would make under counterfactual knowledge in offsetting gender and race biases and overcoming sycophancy.

While these approaches demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, they often overlooked the trade-off of resource efficiency and inference effectiveness, leading to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal inference performance. To address this problem, a fuzzy controller (FC-r) is developed based on key system parameters and inference-related metrics. Guided by the FC-r, a VI enhancement framework is proposed, where the spatiotemporal correlation of targets across adjacent video frames is leveraged. Given the real-time resource conditions of the target device, the framework can dynamically switch between models of varying scales during VI.

First, the attention mechanism requires massive matrix multiplications and frequent movement of intermediate results between memory and compute units, leading to high latency and energy costs. Second, in long-context inference, the key-value cache (KV cache) can grow unpredictably and even surpass the model's weight size, creating severe memory and bandwidth bottlenecks. Third, the quadratic complexity of attention with respect to sequence length amplifies both data movement and compute overhead, making large-scale inference inefficient. To address these issues, this work introduces processing-in-memory solutions that restructure attention and feed-forward computation to minimize off-chip data transfers, dynamically compress and prune the KV cache to manage memory growth, and reinterpret attention as an associative memory operation to reduce complexity and hardware footprint. Moreover, we evaluate our processing-in-memory design against state-of-the-art accelerators and general-purpose GPUs, demonstrating significant improvements in energy efficiency and latency. Together, these approaches address computation overhead, memory scalability, and attention complexity, further enabling efficient, end-to-end acceleration of Transformer models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51faTransformer\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5185\u5b58\u5185\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5728\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Transformer\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u5e26\u5bbd\u74f6\u9888\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5185\u5b58\u5185\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cd\u6784\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u524d\u9988\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u4fee\u526aKV\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5173\u8054\u5185\u5b58\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u548c\u901a\u7528GPU\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

However, this automation is a double-edged sword: a single misconfiguration in IaC scripts can propagate widely, leading to severe system downtime and security risks. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain security smells--bad coding patterns that may introduce vulnerabilities--and have proposed static analyzers based on symbolic rules to detect them. Yet, our preliminary analysis reveals that rule-based detection alone tends to over-approximate, producing excessive false positives and increasing the burden of manual inspection. In this paper, we present IntelliSA, an intelligent static analyzer for IaC security smell detection that integrates symbolic rules with neural inference. IntelliSA applies symbolic rules to over-approximate potential smells for broad coverage, then employs neural inference to filter false positives. While an LLM can effectively perform this filtering, reliance on LLM APIs introduces high cost and latency, raises data governance concerns, and limits reproducibility and offline deployment. To address the challenges, we adopt a knowledge distillation approach: an LLM teacher generates pseudo-labels to train a compact student model--over 500x smaller--that learns from the teacher's knowledge and efficiently classifies false positives. We evaluate IntelliSA against two static analyzers and three LLM baselines (Claude-4, Grok-4, and GPT-5) using a human-labeled dataset including 241 security smells across 11,814 lines of real-world IaC code. Experimental results show that IntelliSA achieves the highest F1 score (83%), outperforming baselines by 7-42%.

Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement.

This misalignment generates corrupted reward signals that destabilize training by penalizing correct reasoning or rewarding hallucination. To address this, we propose SearchGym, a simulation environment designed to bootstrap robust search agents. SearchGym employs a rigorous generative pipeline to construct a verifiable knowledge graph and an aligned document corpus, ensuring that every reasoning task is factually grounded and strictly solvable. Building on this controllable environment, we introduce SearchGym-RL, a curriculum learning methodology that progressively optimizes agent policies through purified feedback, evolving from basic interactions to complex, long-horizon planning.

Ambiguous Emotion Recognition addresses this by representing emotions as probability distributions, but progress is limited by unreliable ground-truth distributions inferred from sparse human annotations. This paper explores whether Large Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can mitigate the annotation bottleneck by generating high-quality synthetic annotations. We introduce a framework leveraging ALMs to create Synthetic Perceptual Proxies, augmenting human annotations to improve ground-truth distribution reliability. We validate these proxies through statistical analysis of their alignment with human distributions and evaluate their impact by fine-tuning ALMs with the augmented emotion distributions. Furthermore, to address class imbalance and enable unbiased evaluation, we propose DiME-Aug, a Distribution-aware Multimodal Emotion Augmentation strategy. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MSP-Podcast show that synthetic annotations enhance emotion distribution, especially in low-ambiguity regions where annotation agreement is high. However, benefits diminish for highly ambiguous emotions with greater human disagreement. This work provides the first evidence that ALMs could address annotation scarcity in ambiguous emotion recognition, but highlights the need for more advanced prompting or generation strategies to handle highly ambiguous cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6807\u6ce8\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5408\u6210\u6807\u6ce8\u6709\u6548\u679c\u4f46\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u611f\u5f85\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u5355\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u5ffd\u7565\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u53d1\u5c55\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5229\u7528\u5927\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u63d0\u51faDiME - Aug\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEMOCAP\u548cMSP - Podcast\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6807\u6ce8\u589e\u5f3a\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f4e\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u9ad8\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u611f\u6548\u679c\u51cf\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u51b5\u9700\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Here we present Neuromorphic Vision-Language-Action (NeuroVLA), a framework that mimics the structural organization of the bio-nervous system between the cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord.

Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u68ee\u6797\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7684LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406Forest - Chat\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fLLM\u9a71\u52a8RSICI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u4e0eVLMs\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Forest - Chat\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u7ea7\u522b\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff08MCI\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9aa8\u5e72\u548cLLM\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u754c\u9762\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Forest - Change\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "Forest - Chat\u5728Forest - Change\u548cLEVIR - MCI - Trees\u4e0a\u8054\u5408\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684RSICI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u68ee\u6797\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This representational mismatch creates an unmeasured fragility wherein reasoning processes can fail. LLMs may treat two internal representations as distinct \"words\" even when they are semantically identical at the text level. In this work, we show that tokenization can betray LLM reasoning through one-to-many token ID mappings. We introduce a tokenization-consistency probe that requires models to replace designated target words in context while leaving all other content unchanged. The task is intentionally simple at the surface level, enabling us to attribute failures to tokenizer-detokenizer artifacts rather than to knowledge gaps or parameter limitations. Through analysis of over 11000 replacement trials across state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, we find a non-trivial rate of outputs exhibit phantom edits: cases where models operate under the illusion of correct reasoning, a phenomenon arising from tokenizer-induced representational defects. We further analyze these cases and provide a taxonomy of eight systematic tokenizer artifacts, including whitespace-boundary shifts and intra-word resegmentation.

Indeed, existing defenses rely on LLM-mediated checking stages that add substantial latency and cost, and that can be undermined in multi-turn interactions through manipulation or benign-looking conversational scaffolding. Contrasting this background, this paper makes a key observation: internal representations associated with privacy-violating intent can be separated from benign requests using linear structure. Using this insight, the paper proposes NeuroFilter, a guardrail framework that operationalizes contextual integrity by mapping norm violations to simple directions in the model's activation space, enabling detection even when semantic filters are bypassed. The proposed filter is also extended to capture threats arising during long conversations using the concept of activation velocity, which measures cumulative drift in internal representations across turns. A comprehensive evaluation across over 150,000 interactions and covering models from 7B to 70B parameters, illustrates the strong performance of NeuroFilter in detecting privacy attacks while maintaining zero false positives on benign prompts, all while reducing the computational inference cost by several orders of magnitude when compared to LLM-based agentic privacy defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNeuroFilter\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u3001\u96f6\u8bef\u62a5\u4e14\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u6613\u88ab\u7834\u574f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u79bb\u9690\u79c1\u8fdd\u89c4\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u6b63\u5e38\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51faNeuroFilter\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c4\u8303\u8fdd\u89c4\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u901f\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d8515\u4e07\u6b21\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cNeuroFilter\u68c0\u6d4b\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6b63\u5e38\u63d0\u793a\u96f6\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroFilter\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Limited historical data, dependence on exogeneous factors, and heterogenous prosumer behaviour introduce significant epistemic uncertainty, making deterministic or poorly calibrated probabilistic models unsuitable for market bidding. This paper proposes the use of scalable uncertainty quantification framework that integrates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) with conformal prediction (CP) to produce calibrated, finite sample prediction intervals for aggregated prosumer flexibility. The proposed framework is applied to a behind-the-meter aggregator participating in the Danish manual frequency restoration reserve capacity market. A large-scale synthetic dataset is generated using a modified industry-grade home energy management system, combined with publicly available load, solar, price, activation and device-level data. The resulting machine learning surrogate model captures aggregate prosumer price responsiveness and provides uncertainty-aware estimates suitable for market bidding. Multiple multivariate CP strategies are evaluated and benchmarked against conventional MCD-based methods. Results show that standalone MCD systematically overestimates available flexibility and violates P90 compliance, whereas the proposed MCD-CP framework achieves reliable coverage with controlled conservatism. When embedded in aggregator bidding model, conformalised methods substantially reduce overbidding risk and achieve upto 70% of perfect-information profit while satisfying regulatory reliability constraints, providing practical, computationally efficient, and market-compliant solution for aggregator flexibility forecasting under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210MCD\u4e0eCP\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7528\u6237\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e39\u9ea6\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6295\u6807\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u6237\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u53c2\u4e0e\u8c03\u9891\u8f85\u52a9\u670d\u52a1\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u805a\u5408\u5546\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5916\u751f\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7b49\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210Monte Carlo dropout (MCD)\u4e0econformal prediction (CP)\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e39\u9ea6\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u7528\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5bb6\u5ead\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u53d8\u91cfCP\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfMCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u72ec\u7acbMCD\u4f1a\u9ad8\u4f30\u53ef\u7528\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e14\u8fdd\u53cdP90\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MCD - CP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8986\u76d6\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u805a\u5408\u5546\u6295\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6295\u6807\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe70%\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u6da6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u805a\u5408\u5546\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u5e02\u573a\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Due to this prevailing belief, the possibility of (maliciously) perturbed benign packets being misclassified as attack has been largely ignored. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is not only theoretically possible, but also a particular threat to NIDS. In particular, we uncover a practical cyberattack, FPR manipulation attack (FPA), especially targeting industrial IoT networks, where domain-specific knowledge of the widely used MQTT protocol is exploited and a systematic simple packet-level perturbation is performed to alter the labels of benign traffic samples without employing traditional gradient-based or non-gradient-based methods. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that this novel attack results in a success rate of 80.19% to 100%. In addition, while estimating impacts in the Security Operations Center, we observe that even a small fraction of false positive alerts, irrespective of different budget constraints and alert traffic intensities, can increase the delay of genuine alerts investigations up to 2 hr in a single day under normal operating conditions.

Redirected Walking (RDW) techniques mitigate this by subtly manipulating the virtual camera to guide users away from physical collisions within pre-defined VEs. However, RDW efficacy diminishes significantly when substantial geometric divergence exists between the physical and virtual environments, leading to unavoidable collisions. Existing scene generation methods primarily focus on object relationships or layout aesthetics, often neglecting the crucial aspect of physical compatibility required for effective RDW. To address this, we introduce HCVR (High Compatibility Virtual Reality Environment Generation), a novel framework that generates virtual scenes inherently optimized for alignment-based RDW controllers. HCVR first employs ENI++, a novel, boundary-sensitive metric to evaluate the incompatibility between physical and virtual spaces by comparing rotation-sensitive visibility polygons. Guided by the ENI++ compatibility map and user prompts, HCVR utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware 3D asset retrieval and initial layout generation. The framework then strategically adjusts object selection, scaling, and placement to maximize coverage of virtually incompatible regions, effectively guiding users towards RDW-feasible paths. User studies evaluating physical collisions and layout quality demonstrate HCVR's effectiveness with HCVR-generated scenes, resulting in 22.78 times fewer physical collisions and received 35.89\\% less on ENI++ score compared to LLM-based generation with RDW, while also receiving 12.5\\% higher scores on user feedback to layout design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u81ea\u7136\u884c\u8d70\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u6c89\u6d78\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHCVR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9002\u914d\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u884c\u8d70\u6280\u672f\u7684\u865a\u62df\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u78b0\u649e\u4e14\u63d0\u5347\u5e03\u5c40\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u884c\u8d70\u53d7\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u884c\u8d70\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u51e0\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u7269\u7406\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u654f\u611f\u6307\u6807ENI++\u8bc4\u4f30\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u865a\u62df\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u8d44\u4ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u518d\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u5bf9\u8c61\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u653e\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u884c\u8d70\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cHCVR\u751f\u6210\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7269\u7406\u78b0\u649e\u51cf\u5c1122.78\u500d\uff0cENI++\u5206\u6570\u964d\u4f4e35.89%\uff0c\u5e03\u5c40\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u9ad812.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "HCVR\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u517c\u5bb9\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u884c\u8d70\u6280\u672f\u7684\u865a\u62df\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7269\u7406\u78b0\u649e\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5e03\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce AQAScore, a backbone-agnostic evaluation framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of audio-aware large language models (ALLMs). AQAScore reformulates assessment as a probabilistic semantic verification task; rather than relying on open-ended text generation, it estimates alignment by computing the exact log-probability of a \"Yes\" answer to targeted semantic queries. We evaluate AQAScore across multiple benchmarks, including human-rated relevance, pairwise comparison, and compositional reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that AQAScore consistently achieves higher correlation with human judgments than similarity-based metrics and generative prompting baselines, showing its effectiveness in capturing subtle semantic inconsistencies and scaling with the capability of underlying ALLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAQAScore\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684AQAScore\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "AQAScore\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u6807\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "AQAScore\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u5e95\u5c42ALLMs\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.\n  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

To improve the affordability and openness of TTM training, an open-source generative model backbone that is more training- and data-efficient is needed. In this paper, we constrain the number of trainable parameters in the generative model to match that of the MusicGen-small benchmark (with about 300M parameters), and replace its Transformer backbone with the emerging class of state-space models (SSMs). Specifically, we explore different SSM variants for sequence modeling, and compare a single-stage SSM-based design with a decomposable two-stage SSM/diffusion hybrid design. All proposed models are trained from scratch on a purely public dataset comprising 457 hours of CC-licensed music, ensuring full openness. Our experimental findings are three-fold. First, we show that SSMs exhibit superior training efficiency compared to the Transformer counterpart. Second, despite using only 9% of the FLOPs and 2% of the training data size compared to the MusicGen-small benchmark, our model achieves competitive performance in both objective metrics and subjective listening tests based on MusicCaps captions. Finally, our scaling-down experiment demonstrates that SSMs can maintain competitive performance relative to the Transformer baseline even at the same training budget (measured in iterations), when the model size is reduced to four times smaller.

This study introduces a multi-modal melanoma detection system using conventional photo images, making it more accessible and versatile. Our system integrates image data with tabular metadata, such as patient demographics and lesion characteristics, to improve detection accuracy. It employs a multi-modal neural network combining image and metadata processing and supports a two-step model for cases with or without metadata. A three-stage pipeline further refines predictions by boosting algorithms and enhancing performance. To address the challenges of a highly imbalanced dataset, specific techniques were implemented to ensure robust training.

This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures.

While 3D Gaussian Splashing (3D-GS) offers unprecedented rendering speed and quality, current animation techniques often rely on a \"one-size-fits-all\" global tuning approach, where all Gaussian primitives are uniformly driven by a single expression code. This simplistic approach fails to unravel the distinct dynamics of different facial regions, such as deformable skin versus rigid teeth, leading to significant blurring and distortion artifacts. We introduce Conditionally-Adaptive Gaussian Avatars (CAG-Avatar), a framework that resolves this key limitation. At its core is a Conditionally Adaptive Fusion Module built on cross-attention. This mechanism empowers each 3D Gaussian to act as a query, adaptively extracting relevant driving signals from the global expression code based on its canonical position. This \"tailor-made\" conditioning strategy drastically enhances the modeling of fine-grained, localized dynamics.

Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator.

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars.

While effective to some extent, these methods often still leak high-level information such as class distributions or feature representations, and are frequently broken by increasingly powerful denoising attacks. We propose a fundamentally different perspective on FL defense: framing it as a spoofing problem.We introduce SpooFL (Figure 1), a spoofing-based defense that deceives attackers into believing they have recovered the true training data, while actually providing convincing but entirely synthetic samples from an unrelated task. Unlike prior synthetic-data defenses that share classes or distributions with the private data and thus still leak semantic information, SpooFL uses a state-of-the-art generative model trained on an external dataset with no class overlap. As a result, attackers are misled into recovering plausible yet completely irrelevant samples, preventing meaningful data leakage while preserving FL training integrity.

This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor.

Now a days music genre classification is very significant because of the exponential increase in available music, both in digital and physical formats. It is necessary to index them accordingly to facilitate improved retrieval. Automatically classifying Bangla music by genre is essential for efficiently locating specific pieces within a vast and diverse music library. Prevailing methods for genre classification predominantly employ conventional machine learning or deep learning approaches. This work introduces a novel music dataset comprising ten distinct genres of Bangla music. For the task of audio classification, we utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is implemented to train the model and perform the classification. Feature extraction represents a foundational stage in audio data processing. This study utilizes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to transform raw audio waveforms into a compact and representative set of features.

To address this critical gap, we introduce CorpusQA, a new benchmark scaling up to 10 million tokens, generated via a novel data synthesis framework. By decoupling reasoning from textual representation, this framework creates complex, computation-intensive queries with programmatically guaranteed ground-truth answers, challenging systems to perform holistic reasoning over vast, unstructured text without relying on fallible human annotation. We further demonstrate the utility of our framework beyond evaluation, showing that fine-tuning on our synthesized data effectively enhances an LLM's general long-context reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art long-context LLMs struggle as input length increases, and standard retrieval-augmented generation systems collapse entirely.

In contrast, audio-text embedding models like CLAP-based models have largely relied on alternative audio encoders (e.g., HTS-AT, PaSST), and have not leveraged Whisper effectively. We present WavLink, a compact audio-text embedding model that augments Whisper encoder with a learnable global token, trained jointly with a text encoder.

Intuitively, this flexibility implies a solution space that strictly supersets the fixed autoregressive trajectory, theoretically unlocking superior reasoning potential for general tasks like mathematics and coding. Consequently, numerous works have leveraged reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit the reasoning capability of dLLMs. In this paper, we reveal a counter-intuitive reality: arbitrary order generation, in its current form, narrows rather than expands the reasoning boundary of dLLMs. We find that dLLMs tend to exploit this order flexibility to bypass high-uncertainty tokens that are crucial for exploration, leading to a premature collapse of the solution space. This observation challenges the premise of existing RL approaches for dLLMs, where considerable complexities, such as handling combinatorial trajectories and intractable likelihoods, are often devoted to preserving this flexibility. We demonstrate that effective reasoning is better elicited by intentionally forgoing arbitrary order and applying standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) instead. Our approach, JustGRPO, is minimalist yet surprisingly effective (e.g., 89.1% accuracy on GSM8K) while fully retaining the parallel decoding ability of dLLMs. Project page: https://nzl-thu.github.io/the-flexibility-trap", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f1a\u7f29\u5c0f\u63a8\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u653e\u5f03\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6GRPO\u7684JustGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u597d\u4e14\u4fdd\u7559\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f17\u591a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6316\u6398dLLMs\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524ddLLMs\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5b58\u7591\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u653e\u5f03\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6807\u51c6Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\uff0c\u63d0\u51faJustGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "JustGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u7ea6\u4e14\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5982\u5728GSM8K\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe89.1%\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86dLLMs\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524ddLLMs\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f1a\u7f29\u5c0f\u63a8\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u653e\u5f03\u8be5\u65b9\u5f0f\u91c7\u7528JustGRPO\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6fc0\u53d1\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes.

While prior work has proposed contamination detection methods, these approaches are largely limited to English benchmarks, leaving multilingual contamination poorly understood. In this work, we investigate contamination dynamics in multilingual settings by fine-tuning several open-weight LLMs on varying proportions of Arabic datasets and evaluating them on original English benchmarks. To detect memorization, we extend the Tested Slot Guessing method with a choice-reordering strategy and incorporate Min-K% probability analysis, capturing both behavioral and distributional contamination signals.\n  Our results show that translation into Arabic suppresses conventional contamination indicators, yet models still benefit from exposure to contaminated data, particularly those with stronger Arabic capabilities. This effect is consistently reflected in rising Mink% scores and increased cross-lingual answer consistency as contamination levels grow. To address this blind spot, we propose Translation-Aware Contamination Detection, which identifies contamination by comparing signals across multiple translated benchmark variants rather than English alone.

Thirty-two licensed drivers completed five secondary tasks while visual and cognitive demands were measured using the Detection Response Task (DRT) for cognitive load, eye-tracking for visual attention, and subjective workload ratings. Results indicated that Gemini Live interactions (both single-turn and multi-turn) and hands-free phone calls shared similar levels of cognitive load, between that of visual turn-by-turn guidance and OSPAN. Exploratory analysis showed that cognitive load remained stable across extended multi-turn conversations. All tasks maintained mean glance durations well below the well-established 2-second safety threshold, confirming low visual demand. Furthermore, drivers consistently dedicated longer glances to the roadway between brief off-road glances toward the device during task completion, particularly during voice-based interactions, rendering longer total-eyes-off-road time findings less consequential. Subjective ratings mirrored objective data, with participants reporting low effort, demands, and perceived distraction for Gemini Live.

We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u89c6\u56fetransformer\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRayRoPE\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u548c\u7acb\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5bf9\u591a\u89c6\u56fetransformer\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5982\u552f\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u6591\u5757\u3001\u652f\u6301SE(3)\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRayRoPE\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u5c04\u7ebf\u8868\u793a\u6591\u5757\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u67e5\u8be2\u5e27\u6295\u5f71\u5750\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0SE(3)\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u671f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u548c\u7acb\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cRayRoPE\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5982\u5728CO3D\u4e0aLPIPS\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534715%\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u6574\u5408RGB - D\u8f93\u5165\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "RayRoPE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fetransformer\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite the impressive in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing methods are hindered by their reliance on static, heuristic-driven prompting strategies. Due to the lack of reflection mechanisms required to internalize erroneous signals, these methods exhibit vulnerability in semantic ambiguity, often making erroneous extraction patterns permanent. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Knowledge Reconstruction-driven Prompt Optimization (KRPO) framework to assist LLMs in continuously improving their extraction capabilities for complex ORTE task flows. Specifically, we design a self-evaluation mechanism based on knowledge restoration, which provides intrinsic feedback signals by projecting structured triplets into semantic consistency scores. Subsequently, we propose a prompt optimizer based on a textual gradient that can internalize historical experiences to iteratively optimize prompts, which can better guide LLMs to handle subsequent extraction tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate relation redundancy, we design a relation canonicalization memory that collects representative relations and provides semantically distinct schemas for the triplets.

Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

We propose a novel framework for differential privacy generation, which employs an Error Feedback Stochastic Gradient Descent(EFSGD) method and introduces a reconstruction loss and noise injection mechanism into the training process.

Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging.

To address these limitations, we introduce V-CAGE, a closed-loop framework for generating robust, semantically aligned manipulation datasets at scale. First, we propose a context-aware instantiation mechanism that enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis. By dynamically maintaining a map of prohibited spatial areas as objects are placed, our system prevents interpenetration and ensures reachable, conflict-free configurations in cluttered environments. Second, to bridge the gap between abstract intent and low-level control, we employ a hierarchical instruction decomposition module. This decomposes high-level goals (e.g., \"get ready for work\") into compositional action primitives, facilitating coherent long-horizon planning. Crucially, we enforce semantic correctness through a VLM-based verification loop. Acting as a visual critic, the VLM performs rigorous rejection sampling after each subtask, filtering out \"silent failures\" where code executes but fails to achieve the visual goal.

Even when relevant information exists in the corpus, truncation can prevent compatible evidence from co-occurring, leading to failures that are not captured by relevance-based evaluation. This paper studies retrieval from a structural perspective, modeling query answering as a feasibility problem under truncation.\n  We formalize retrieval as a sequence of candidate evidence sets and characterize conditions under which feasibility in the limit implies feasibility at finite retrieval depth. We show that monotone truncation suffices to guarantee finite witnessability for individual queries. For classes of queries, we identify finite generation of witness certificates as the additional condition required to obtain a uniform retrieval bound, and we show that this condition is necessary. We further exhibit sharp counterexamples demonstrating failure under non-monotone truncation, non-finitely-generated query classes, and purely slotwise coverage.\n  Together, these results isolate feasibility preservation as a correctness criterion for retrieval independent of relevance scoring or optimization, and clarify structural limitations inherent to truncation-based retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u7b54\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u622a\u65ad\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6709\u9650\u53ef\u89c1\u8bc1\u6027\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u622a\u65ad\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u622a\u65ad\u53ef\u7528\u8bc1\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u68c0\u7d22\u5931\u8d25\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5019\u9009\u8bc1\u636e\u96c6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6781\u9650\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u68c0\u7d22\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u8c03\u622a\u65ad\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5355\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6709\u9650\u53ef\u89c1\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u8fd8\u9700\u6709\u9650\u751f\u6210\u89c1\u8bc1\u8bc1\u4e66\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u7b49\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u53cd\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4fdd\u5b58\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u6216\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u622a\u65ad\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6RBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u53c8\u63a8\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u96c6RoVid - X\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6001\u63a8\u52a8\u5177\u8eabAI\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6RBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5b50\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6RoVid - X\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f3025\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u903c\u771f\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1bRBench\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65af\u76ae\u5c14\u66fc\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u8fbe0.96\uff1b\u5f97\u5230\u542b400\u4e07\u6ce8\u91ca\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6RoVid - X\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6001\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u5177\u8eabAI\u5411\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}
