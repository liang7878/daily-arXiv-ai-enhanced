Traditional sequential recommenders predominantly rely\non ID-based embeddings, which capture CF signals through high-order\nco-occurrence patterns.

While Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.\nCommon issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation\nof overly detailed or \"overthinking\" reasoning. Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,\nDifficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically\nadjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents\npolicy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes\nsamples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative\nsamples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to\npenalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages\nmore concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We\napply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B\nsignificantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\\% gain over\nthe base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning\nbenchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade\non general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating\nsuperior generalization.

For example, cloud computing resources\nare evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network\nbandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to\ncapture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we\nstudy two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up\nto c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods\n(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'\npreferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each\ndimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a\ndifferent set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the\nstrong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the\nenvied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide\nupper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the\nexistence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are\nindependent of the total number of items.

Results from three cases demonstrate the DRL\napproach's effectiveness. We integrated the surrogate 3D U-Net model into our\nDRL environment to accelerate the reinforcement learning training process. The\nreward function minimizes both aspect ratio and grain volume of the predicted\nmicrostructure from the agent's scan path.

Ideally, a theorist abstracts protocols as ideal,\nimplementation-independent primitives, letting conclusions in the \"ideal world\"\ncarry over to the \"real world.\" This is crucial, since the game theorist\ncannot--and should not be expected to--handle full cryptographic complexity. In\ntoday's landscape, the rise of distributed ledgers makes a shared language\nbetween cryptography and game theory increasingly necessary.\n  The security of cryptographic protocols hinges on two types of assumptions:\nstate-of-the-world (e.g., \"factoring is hard\") and behavioral (e.g., \"honest\nmajority\").

For\nstate-of-the-world assumptions, we show that standard solution concepts, e.g.,\n($\\epsilon$-)Nash equilibria, are not robust to transfer from the ideal to the\nreal world.\n  We propose a new solution concept: the pseudo-Nash equilibrium.

Pseudo-Nash is simpler\nand more accessible to game theorists than prior notions addressing the\nmismatch between (asymptotic) cryptography and game theory. We prove that Nash\nequilibria in games with ideal, unbreakable cryptography correspond to\npseudo-Nash equilibria when ideal cryptography is instantiated with real\nprotocols (under state-of-the-world assumptions).

However, the\ndata ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and\nincompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail\nto cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this\npaper introduces the concept of \"Query as Test\" (QaT). This concept shifts the\nfocus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries\nagainst a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a\nfundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our\nproposal of \"Extensible Scenarios Notations\" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative\ndata framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly\nrepresents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as\na collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep\nsemantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports\ncomplex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides\nnatural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for\non-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy\nprotection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the\nfunctional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving\nsystems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing\nthe expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing.

We propose to unify\nthese tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the\nneed for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However,\nunlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear\nlabels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To\novercome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with\nreinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose\nthe complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the\nworst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly\nreduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context\nlength during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate\nan IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation,\nrouting, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B\nachieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of\nsimilar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain\ndatasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the\nrobustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we\nconducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization\nexperiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on\nin-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement.\nSurprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the\nbase model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA.

We evaluate\nARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG\nsignificantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving\nup to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5.

Firstly, we conduct a detailed review of existing works,\norganizing and analyzing their metrics, tasks, benchmarks, and scenario\nsettings. Secondly, we propose a new taxonomy of CRL methods, categorizing them\ninto four types from the perspective of knowledge storage and/or transfer.\nFinally, our analysis highlights the unique challenges of CRL and provides\npractical insights into future directions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5bf9\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5ba1\u89c6\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0cCRL\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u56de\u987e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6307\u6807\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7b49\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u50a8\u548c/\u6216\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684CRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u65b0\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6210\u5bf9CRL\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u56de\u987e\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u51faCRL\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9CRL\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Building on its probabilistic\nfoundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class\nsegmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.\nNotably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we\nleverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for\nadaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM\nprovides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image\nsegmentation.

In this\npaper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that\nretains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these\nlimitations.

However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with\nrespect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of\nlandmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This\nerror-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous\nlandmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage\nthe error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we\npropose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)\nfor coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding\nforce in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the\nother hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask\nfocusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent\npoints, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means\nrelaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary\nmanner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we\nintegrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet.

To improve the automation of these bidding\nsystems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to\ntackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision\nTransformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential\nmodeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term\ndependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,\nconventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset\nreturn-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently\nproduced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,\nwhich is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to\nimprove the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the\nsuboptimal policy towards optimality.

In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking.\nExisting gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures,\nleading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities.\nBuilding on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel\ngender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to\naddress existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed\nmetric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a\nsubset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender\nbias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.\nOur extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our\nproposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to\nprevious metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for\nGrep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa\nagreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating\nLLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias\nannotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust\nframework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8861\u91cf\u6bb5\u843d\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u522b\u516c\u5e73\u6307\u6807CWEx\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8MS MARCO Passage Ranking\u5b50\u96c6\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03MSMGenderBias\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6027\u522b\u516c\u5e73\u6307\u6807\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6307\u6807CWEx\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8MS MARCO Passage Ranking\u5b50\u96c6\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6MSMGenderBias\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\uff08Grep - BiasIR\u4e3a58.77%\uff0cMSMGenderBias\u4e3a18.51%\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u5dee\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow\na stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs\nedges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for\nincreasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The\ngraph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable\nto deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The\nobservation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state\ncapturing multi-hop neighboring influence.

Recent research\nhas been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by\nselecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data\nfiltering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To\ncomplement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance\nby optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively\nunderexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the\ndata efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,\nvarious instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying\ndegrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement.

However, their design primarily targets\nreal-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks\ninvolving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical\nvariables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically\ntask-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this\ngap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge\nTSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate\nhomogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level\nhomogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified\nattention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for\nadaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating\nextra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of\nTSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware\nforecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the\npromise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.\nCodes are released on https://github.com/hanlu-nju/UniCA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUniCA\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3TSFMs\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u8d28\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSFMs\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5b9e\u503c\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u5f02\u8d28\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u9002\u5e94\uff08UniCA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86UniCA\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684TSFM\u9002\u5e94\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Traditional TD methods rely on predefined structural\nassumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. From a probabilistic\nperspective, these can be viewed as using Dirac delta distributions to model\nthe relationships between shared factors and the low-rank tensor. However, such\nprior knowledge is rarely available in practical scenarios, particularly\nregarding the optimal rank structure and contraction rules. The optimization\nprocedures based on fixed contraction rules are complex, and approximations\nmade during these processes often lead to accuracy loss. To address this issue,\nwe propose a score-based model that eliminates the need for predefined\nstructural or distributional assumptions, enabling the learning of\ncompatibility between tensors and shared factors. Specifically, a neural\nnetwork is designed to learn the energy function, which is optimized via score\nmatching to capture the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries\nand shared factors.

However, the current\npractice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases\ninevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them\nprohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to\ndistill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics\npriors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable\nand naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into\nan implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional\nphysical constraints in navigation tasks.

Our\ncomprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic\nPersonalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets\nand an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves\nhighly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with\nstate-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and\nunsupervised PFL tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCLoVE\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5e7f\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u5206\u914d\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5ba2\u6237\u805a\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4ece\u5ba2\u6237\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u635f\u5931\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u540c\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0cCLoVE\u80fd\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u5728\u4e00\u8f6e\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6307\u6570\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u6062\u590d\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CLoVE\u7b97\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5e7f\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However,\nexisting research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of\nthese models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their\nself-reflection pattern (also termed \"Aha moment\") and the interconnections\nacross diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the\nreasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,\nDeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge\nparadigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their\nfinal outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based\nquestions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step\nproblem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both\nthe coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research\nresults uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and\nexploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning\nprocess. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among\nthese models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the\nreliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their\nthinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers\nvaluable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and\nreasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model\ndesign and evaluation in practical applications.

Although autoregressive systems\nexhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token\ngeneration mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of\nsynthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion.

In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines.

However, traditional deep learning approaches for\nECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation,\nself-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling\nthe extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently\ntransferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored\nSSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail\nto capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods\nstruggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model\nthe hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP,\na novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages\nhierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a\ncardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical\ntext. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token,\nbeat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing\nstructured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three\npublic ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG\nclassification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its\neffectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications.

Their inverse\ndesign - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is\nchallenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and\noptical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local\nminima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we\naddress these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of\ndiffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator,\nwe generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their\ncorresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional\ndiffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial\npower distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous\nsupported band.

These changes are widely\nattributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in\nthe discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in\nfrequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.\nThe present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve\nthe replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, \"crucial\"\nreplacing \"essential\" and \"key,\" or whether they reflect broader semantic and\npragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective \"important\"\nshows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze\ndecreasing lexical items. Our analysis of \"collapsing\" words reveals a more\ncomplex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts\nwith the patterns of the abrupt spikes.

Among the\nstatements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and\ndemonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods\nthat aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.\nThese approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical\nvalue of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u5b66\u9648\u8ff0\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5176\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u9ed1\u76d2UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f30\u8ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578bAPI\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80cc\u540e\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u9648\u8ff0\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u6765\u6355\u6349\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u7528\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u201cSim - Any\u201d\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

A key factor\nis that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking\nmechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a\nsimple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level\nspatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual\nprompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically\ndemonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning\ntasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by\n25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in\nscene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship\ntasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset.

Yet such integration is more urgent than ever, as the\nrecent success of artificial intelligence has been driven largely by machine\nlearning -- a field historically developed alongside statistics. Today, the\nboundary between statistics and machine learning is increasingly blurred. What\nwe now need is integration, twice over: of history and philosophy, and of the\nfield they engage -- statistics and machine learning. I present a case study of\na philosophical idea in machine learning (and in formal epistemology) whose\nroot can be traced back to an often under-appreciated insight in Neyman and\nPearson's 1936 work (a follow-up to their 1933 classic).

Using the large-scale ImageNet\ndataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves\nimage classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5\naccuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard\nclassical augmentation methods.

While neural generation\nmethods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial\nreasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable\ngeneration but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints\nbecome numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of\nfurniture items and compromising layout completeness.\n  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline\nthat converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D\nindoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a\nconstraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts\nhigh-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a\nstructured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.\nIt then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture\narrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a\nheuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.\nTo handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint\nrepresentation that processes both formal specifications and natural language\ninputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a\ncomprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware\nPositioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to\nminimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms\nexisting methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually\nappealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRoomCraft\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a3D\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u91cd\u590d\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u573a\u666f\u6709\u7269\u4f53\u78b0\u649e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u62103D\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u6784\u5efa\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528HDFS\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u653e\u7f6e\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7ea6\u675f\u8868\u793a\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "RoomCraft\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RoomCraft\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u62103D\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,\ntoken-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time\nwithout altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four\nsynergistic mechanisms:\n  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged\nrepresentations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory\nwrites to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which\ncollapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.\n  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on\nfrozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks.

Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering\nout-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as\nwidefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.\nComputational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to\ncheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off\ntells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high\nPSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.\nExisting methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or\nproduce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In\nthis work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light\nmicroscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to\nfind a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the\nrealism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the\nconditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a\nhazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on\n5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion\nand perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a\nconsistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with\ncalibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated\npredictions.
