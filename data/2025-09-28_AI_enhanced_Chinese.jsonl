While LIs achieve remarkable\nefficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic\nupdates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global\nmodel retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)\nmetric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,\nrendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In\nthis paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that\nminimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting\napproximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by\napproximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid\nfunctions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full\nretraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)\nthat identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder\nallocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework\nthat continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via\ngradient-based learning.

This problem is extremely well-studied and a nearly-optimal\n$\\widetilde{O}(d \\log n)$ query algorithm is known due to\nHopkins-Kane-Lovett-Mahajan (FOCS 2020). However, their algorithm is granted\nthe power to query arbitrary points outside of $X$ (point synthesis), and in\nfact without this power there is an $\\Omega(n)$ query lower bound due to\nDasgupta (NeurIPS 2004).\n  In this work our goal is to design efficient algorithms for learning\nhalfspaces without point synthesis. To circumvent the $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound,\nwe consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size\n$D$, and show tight bounds of $\\Theta(D + \\log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain\nan optimal $O(d + \\log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned\nhalfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \\log n)$ vs. $\\Omega(d + \\log n)$.\nIn fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean\nfunction $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$\nprovided orderings.

Drawing from\ntemporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors\nexecution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations\nfrom expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely\nprimarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to\nthe natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method\ninstead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations\nand inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior\nindependent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language\nprovides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple\nexecution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt\nengineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing\nregression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The\napproach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to\nsolve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all\ntemporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller\nmodels were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated\nbehavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed\ncoordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these\nanomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral\nregressions in production agentic systems.

While\nslightly sub-exponential time algorithms exist when the coding rate vanishes\nsufficiently rapidly, all known algorithms at constant rate require exponential\ntime. By contrast, the complexity of decoding a random quantum stabilizer code\nhas remained an open question for quite some time. This work closes the gap in\nour understanding of the algorithmic hardness of decoding random quantum versus\nrandom classical codes. We prove that decoding a random stabilizer code with\neven a single logical qubit is at least as hard as decoding a random classical\ncode at constant rate--the maximally hard regime. This result suggests that the\neasiest random quantum decoding problem is at least as hard as the hardest\nrandom classical decoding problem, and shows that any sub-exponential algorithm\ndecoding a typical stabilizer code, at any rate, would immediately imply a\nbreakthrough in cryptography.\n  More generally, we also characterize many other complexity-theoretic\nproperties of stabilizer codes. While classical decoding admits a random\nself-reduction, we prove significant barriers for the existence of random\nself-reductions in the quantum case. This result follows from new bounds on\nClifford entropies and Pauli mixing times, which may be of independent\ninterest. As a complementary result, we demonstrate various other\nself-reductions which are in fact achievable, such as between search and\ndecision.

However,\nsynchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU\nunderutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths\nwithin rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by\nrelaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this\npaper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for\nsynchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail\nresponses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring\nthat the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short\nrollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them\ninto a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle\ntime during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without\nsacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the\nbenefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL\nstages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation\nand scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show\nthat RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction\ncompared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5\nfamily of LLMs on up to 128 H800 GPUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c3e\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u548cRollPacker\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a0\u901f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728Qwen2.5\u7cfb\u5217\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u540c\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u653e\u677e\u540c\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5c3e\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u957f\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u793a\u5408\u5e76\u5230\u5c11\u6570\u957f\u8f6e\u6b21\uff0c\u6784\u5efaRollPacker\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "RollPacker\u5728Qwen2.5\u7cfb\u5217\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4veRL\u51cf\u5c112.03 - 2.56\u500d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4RLHFuse\u6700\u591a\u52a0\u901f2.24\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3e\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548cRollPacker\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11GPU\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u52a0\u901f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

We\npropose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse\nreward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated\nas a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a\nreward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion\nposterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce\nnon-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference\ninefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward\nFine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing\ntrajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly.

However, traditional approaches face significant\nchallenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences\noffline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a\ncomprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible\nscenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The\nprimary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of\noffline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete\nspace, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the\nonline mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously\nexploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and\nenhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the\nsystem to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more\neffectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning\nunit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models\nnot only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing\nschedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria\nare introduced.

KD for recommender systems targets at distilling\nrankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be\ncomputed on a small subset of items.

We prove that when\nperforming KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound\nof NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the\nitem subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our\ngoal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items.

Existing\nschemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication\noverhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness\nhinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples\nexhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level\nPP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur\nhardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP\ngranularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence\nlength distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a\nchallenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP\nscheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism\n(EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource\nand workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system\nthat unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and\nworkload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short\nones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline\nschedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware\nchunk-level adaptive checkpointing.

Fetal heart rate (FHR)\nmonitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal\ncare, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely\nobstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying\nartificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous\nFHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into\npredicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent\nadvances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring\nwithout compromising maternal mobility.

In this paper, we propose a masked\ntransformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by\ncapturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed\nmethod demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can\nbe used for signal inpainting and forecasting.

While recent advances in\nlarge language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle\nwith complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the\ndifficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we\npropose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating\nLLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key\ncomponents: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM\nRe-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM\nFunctionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language\ndescription that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense\nRetrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed\nboth the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods\n(code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with\nsimilar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the\nretrieved methods based on their contextual relevance.

The RAG\nsystem integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five\nSentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on\ncohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed\nby a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning\npipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.\n  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a\nscalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean\nabsolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best\nconfiguration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor\naccuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE.

We investigate this question in the\nclassical statistical setting of signal estimation from $n$ independent linear\nobservations $Y_i = X_i^{\\top}\\theta + \\epsilon_i$. Our focus is on the\ngeneralization properties of a broad family of predictors that can be expressed\nas linear combinations of the training labels, $f(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} l_{i}(X)\nY_i$. This class -- commonly referred to as linear prediction rules --\nencompasses a wide range of popular parametric and non-parametric estimators,\nincluding ridge regression, gradient descent, and kernel methods. Our\ncontributions are twofold. First, we derive non-asymptotic upper and lower\nbounds on the generalization error for this class under the assumption that the\nBayes predictor $\\theta$ lies in an ellipsoid. Second, we establish a lower\nbound for the subclass of rotationally invariant linear prediction rules when\nthe Bayes predictor is fixed.

Simple\nfactual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex\nlogical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To\novercome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through\nDepth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends\nthe Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised\ncomputation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning\ndepths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical\ninference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned\nrouting network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only\nthe necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we\ntrained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse\ndomains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web\ncontent, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational\nsavings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth\ntransformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex\nmulti-step reasoning benchmarks.

Recent advances in generative diffusion models\nhave shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,\nbut rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited.

First, we\nshow that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a\nlow-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be\ninterpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set.

For instance, when estimating the\naverage treatment effect on the treated (ATT), a doubly robust estimation\nprocedure can be applied, requiring either the propensity score model or the\ncontrol outcome model to be correctly specified. In this paper, we address\nscenarios where external control data, often with a much larger sample size,\nare available. Such data are typically easier to obtain from historical records\nor third-party sources. However, we find that incorporating external controls\ninto the standard doubly robust estimator for ATT may paradoxically result in\nreduced efficiency compared to using the estimator without external controls.\nThis counterintuitive outcome suggests that the naive incorporation of external\ncontrols could be detrimental to estimation efficiency. To resolve this issue,\nwe propose a novel doubly robust estimator that guarantees higher efficiency\nthan the standard approach without external controls, even under model\nmisspecification.

Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with\nBispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT\non benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality\nof meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label\nstructure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class\nor content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u8c31\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08Bispectral Optimal Transport\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u79f0\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6734\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7c7b\u4fdd\u7559\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5bcc\u542b\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u6210\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f1a\u5ffd\u7565\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u76f8\u5e72\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u8c31\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u8c31\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u7fa4\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u5143\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u79f0\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u53cc\u8c31\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u8ba1\u5212\u6bd4\u6734\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7c7b\u4fdd\u7559\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u8c31\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53bb\u9664\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u7c7b\u522b\u6216\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Early risk stratification can benefit\nfrom machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their\ngeneralizability on an external cohort.\n  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and\n(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,\nstandardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training\nfolds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and\nfrozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination\n(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation\nused the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics\non PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.\n  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC\n~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947).

The Transformer-based approach outperforms the D&ML-based\napproach with a 6\\% increase in accuracy by processing actual discussions,\ni.e., without data augmentation. We applied SHAP (SHapley Additive\nexPlanations) for model interpretability, revealing how linguistic features\ndrive predictions and enhancing transparency in classification.

As an application, we also introduced\nTarget-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic\nprofiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,\nwhich enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and\nsupports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a\nscalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,\nreinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable\ntarget and pathway discovery in precision medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGALAX\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210GNN\u4e0eLLM\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u901a\u8def\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165Target - QA\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u5b9a\u91cf\u591a\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u6587\u672c\u751f\u7269\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0cPRMs\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGALAX\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GNN\u96c6\u6210\u5230LLM\u4e2d\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Target - QA\u57fa\u51c6\u7528\u4e8eGNN\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u901a\u8def\u3002"}}

However, compared\nto human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code\nreview to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is\nhampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models.

The Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine are designed using\nthe PWCT visual programming language where the visual implementation is\ncomposed of 18,945 components that generate 24,743 lines of C code, which\nincreases the abstraction level and hides unnecessary details. Using PWCT to\ndevelop Ring allowed us to realize several issues in PWCT, which led to the\ndevelopment of the PWCT2 visual programming language using the Ring textual\nprogramming language. PWCT2 provides approximately 36 times faster code\ngeneration and requires 20 times less storage for visual source files. It also\nallows for the conversion of Ring code into visual code, enabling the creation\nof a self-hosting VPL that can be developed using itself. PWCT2 consists of\napproximately 92,000 lines of Ring code and comes with 394 visual components.\nPWCT2 is distributed to many users through the Steam platform and has received\npositive feedback, On Steam, 1772 users have launched the software, and the\ntotal recorded usage time exceeds 17,000 hours, encouraging further research\nand development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u81ea\u6258\u7ba1\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00PWCT2\uff0c\u5148\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00Ring\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u7528PWCT\u5f00\u53d1Ring\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u540e\u7528Ring\u5f00\u53d1PWCT2\uff0cPWCT2\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Steam\u5206\u53d1\u83b7\u79ef\u6781\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7a0b\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u81ea\u6258\u7ba1\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00Ring\uff0c\u7528PWCT\u5f00\u53d1Ring\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u540e\u7528Ring\u5f00\u53d1PWCT2\u3002", "result": "PWCT2\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u7ea636\u500d\uff0c\u53ef\u89c6\u6e90\u6587\u4ef6\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u5c1120\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u7531\u7ea692000\u884cRing\u4ee3\u7801\u548c394\u4e2a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u5728Steam\u83b7\u79ef\u6781\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "PWCT2\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,\nportions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model\nparameters.

Yet despite striking empirical\ndemonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and\nlacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary\nperspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent\nweaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify\nconditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without\nincorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many\nalternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,\nrendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further\ndemonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.\nOur results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage\nis possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.\nRemarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and\ntherefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,\nless susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need\nfor strong generalization in this setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65e0\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u91cd\u6784\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5145\u5206\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u66f4\u4e0d\u6613\u53d7\u91cd\u6784\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u91cd\u6784\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9700\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5f31\u70b9\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u6570\u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u4f7f\u91cd\u6784\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u5236\u662f\u5076\u7136\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u91cd\u6784\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5145\u5206\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0d\u6613\u53d7\u91cd\u6784\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ec6\u5316\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u6cc4\u9732\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u91cd\u6784\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8c03\u548c\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, organizations are often reluctant\nto share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated\nlearning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local\ndata while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a\npotential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data\nleakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL\nresults in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some\nbelieve protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present\ncontradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers\ncan still extract training data from the global model, even using\nstraightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size\ngrows.

Finally, we provide a new benchmark\nfor personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study\nto verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video\ndataset collection.

Recent studies have shown that\nTransformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data\nquality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational\ncosts, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.\nThis study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of\nhyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the\nquality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It\nis performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model\nsetups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on\nthree dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to\nreal data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world\ndatasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of\nhyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT\nconsistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the\nlargest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools\nachieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger\ndatasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a\nresult, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it\npreserves data quality while reducing computational requirements.

In terms of changing\ntrends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown\nexcellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to\ncapture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures\nposes limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,\nresulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components\nbeing ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively\nincorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose\ncombining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider\nlong-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained\nlocal patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling\nlocal variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that\nprocesses the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the\ninter-channel relationship through distinct layers.

A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but\nfoundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed\nbias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure\ndoes not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this\nproblem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs\nthrough an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its\nspectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response.

While existing\nmethods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,\nleading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this\npaper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class\nproportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and\n(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks\ntarget. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free\nRobustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and\ndistribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a\nrobustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the\nless robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the\ndistribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness\ndistillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a\nuniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the\ndominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced\nrepresentation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target\nAdversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class\nconstraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack\ntargets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable\ncategories.

Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,\nmost existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In\nthis study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial\nstates through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose\nthe concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's\ncompetitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly\nshaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error\nbound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To\nbridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a\nfine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training\ncontroller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a\nprincipled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals\nand thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a\ncomputationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information\ndecomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into\nfine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and\nsynergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically\nbalances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial\nstate to start joint training by tracking peak synergy.

We employ crime incident data obtained from each\ncity's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American\nCommunity Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to\n2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.\nmiles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a\nConvolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime\noccurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also\ncompare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,\nrandom forest, and standard LSTM.\n  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,\nespecially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best\nresults are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used\ntogether, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,\nand F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this\nconfiguration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,\nwhile shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.\n  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse\ndata sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included.

The PFCV\nreduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the\npump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.\nThe hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than\ntheconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position\ncontrol of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a\nfuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using\nMATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments.

In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer\nagents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer\nintegrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.\nThis design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly\nreviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and\ninference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art\nreasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with\ndifferent LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both\ntoken usage and inference time by approximately 50\\%.

However, they typically rely on autoencoders\nconstrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training\ninstances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an\nexplicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount\nof dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and\natomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that\nenforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby\npromoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient\nentropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step\nfunction and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we\nterm it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major\napplications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation.

A\ndiscrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.\nThe core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit\nparameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big\nmove lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update\nrule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and\nwith strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,\nthese choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On\nlanguage modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity\nparity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens\nusing a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and\ncorresponding latency/throughput gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFS - DFM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e32\u884c\u751f\u6210\u9650\u5236\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Few - Step Discrete Flow - Matching\uff08FS - DFM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u6570\u8bbe\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u9760\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "FS - DFM\u57288\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0e1024\u6b65\u79bb\u6563\u6d41\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u62101024\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u8fbe128\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FS - DFM\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

A growing body of\nevidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond\nwhat SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning\nis able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic\ncharacteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from\nprior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal\ndifferences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across\nmultiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:\n(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal\npathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater\ndiversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less\nconcentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes\ninformation flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain\nits advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting\nsubstantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and\nGRPO-based training.

Using a hand-and-brain chess setup, participants either selected a piece\nand the AI decided how it moved (brain mode), or the AI selected a piece and\nthe participant decided how it moved (hand mode). We collected over 400\nmode-switching decisions from eight participants, along with gaze, emotional\nstate, and subtask difficulty data.

However, during training, the backpropagated gradients from original\nand augmented inputs may misalign, which can result in conflicting parameter\nupdates. These conflicts could hinder convergence and push the model toward\nsuboptimal solutions, thereby reducing the benefits of DA. To investigate and\naddress this issue, we design a dual-path data-augmented (DPDA) training\nframework with gradient alignment for SDD. In our framework, each training\nutterance is processed through two input paths: one using the original speech\nand the other with its augmented version.

Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the\nmodel output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a\nwell-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks\nto uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised\ncounterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent\nspace. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning\nprovide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,\nwithout automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided\nby their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too\nreductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning\nmethods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative\nspatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable\nAssociations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local\nembedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To\nachieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities\n(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original\nfeatures, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the\nentire latent space.

This sequential\nstructure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent\nediting. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and\nCAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.\nHowever, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard\nlarge language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into\nnatural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics\nand hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We\nconjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's\nprimitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations.

The robust recourse literature addresses\nthis issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is\nresilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization\nproblem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),\nmost of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the\noptimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first\nprovably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized\nlinear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm.\nHowever, using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high\nprice. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes\ndefined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\\geq 1$ but $p\\neq \\infty$, and provide a\nnew algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for\ngeneralized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,\nwe demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of\nrecourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also\nexhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its\nvalidity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides\nmore sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to\npost-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Prior art\ntypically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.\nHowever, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each\nyear. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent\ncounting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,\nwe argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,\nfrom what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily\nobjects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with\ntime and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than\ncounting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and\nopen-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we\ninherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new\nextension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to\ncross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of\nTasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC.

This paper presents a novel\nmodel, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and\nGAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention\nmechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects\nwithin an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual\ncontext.

By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines\nvisual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.\nExtensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that\nour model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,\nparticularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting\nthe importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in\nadvancing VQA tasks.

Our approach leverages the complementary\nstrengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures\n(e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TF-IDF\nvectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest).\nEmpirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that\nthis combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically,\nthe DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest\nnotably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs.\nThe modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble\nintegration, facilitating real-world adoption.

When knowledge distillation transfers these features to\nstudents, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to\nartifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from\nlarger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an\ninherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative\nsignals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided\nEnergy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses\nartifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled\nteacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided\nperturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the\nrefined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this\nperturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal\nstructural modification.

The two domains cooperate to provide\na fail-safe mechanism based on a safety monitor, which oversees the state of\nthe system and switches to a simpler but safer backup module, hosted in the\nsafety-critical domain, whenever its behavior is considered untrustworthy.\n  The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated by a set of\nexperiments performed on two control systems: a Furuta pendulum and a rover.\nThe results confirm the utility of the fall-back mechanism in preventing faults\ndue to the learning component.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5b89\u4fdd\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6545\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u8fd0\u884c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u9694\u79bb\u6267\u884c\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc71\u578b\u5b9e\u65f6\u865a\u62df\u673a\u7ba1\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u89c6\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6545\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728Furuta\u6446\u548c\u6f2b\u6e38\u8f66\u4e24\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u56de\u9000\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6545\u969c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5b89\u4fdd\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002"}}

Based on our prompting findings, we train\nand evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT\nincentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We\npropose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and\nconduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models\ngeneralize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust\nacross multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with\nmultiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the\nbenchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers.

However, we found that they also risk perpetuating\nsubtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the\nperspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient\nexternality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and\nsystematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an\nLLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other\ncultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000\ngeneration prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through\nthe lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an\nLLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10\ndiverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a\nstark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of\nUS-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider\nstances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2\ninference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness\nIntervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness\nAgents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)\nintroduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.\n(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized\nagents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates\ninitial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates\nfeedback to produce a polished, unbiased script).

However, progress in this field is largely hindered by three\nkey challenges: the scarcity of paired speech data that retains expressive\nstyles, the complexity of multi-stage processing pipelines, and the limited\ntransfer of translation capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this\nwork, we address these challenges by introducing UniSS, a novel single-stage\nframework for expressive S2ST. Our approach features carefully designed speech\nsemantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with existing\ntext-based LLM frameworks to develop a unified text-speech language model. To\ntransfer translation capabilities from text to speech, we propose a cross-modal\nchain-of-thought prompting process that progressively aligns audio semantics\nwith text and ensures style preservation in the decoded results. Furthermore,\nwe construct and release a large-scale, high-quality expressive S2ST dataset,\nUniST, comprising 44.8k hours of data. Experimental results show that UniSS\nsignificantly outperforms previous methods in translation fidelity and speech\nquality while preserving voice, emotion, and duration consistency.

Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)\nusing YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into\ncompact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings\nare then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the\ncropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to\ngenerate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9%\nreduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy\nof 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original\ncropped images.
