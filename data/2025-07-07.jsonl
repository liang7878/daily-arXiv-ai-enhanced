The framework preserves PPO's policy gradient core while\nincorporating constrained optimization through adaptive Lagrangian multipliers.\nTherefore, decentralized agents dynamically balance selfish and cooperative\nincentives. The comparative analysis demonstrates superior performance of this\nconstrained deep reinforcement learning approach compared to unmodified PPO and\nevolutionary game theory baselines.

An alternative approach to designing better\nauction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make\nincentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the\nbidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The\nimplementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of\nbidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable.

Furthermore, we explicitly compute this operad in terms of generators\nand relations, showing that the M\\\"obius transform map induces a canonical\nisomorphism between the operad of cooperative games and the operad that encodes\ncommutative triassociative algebras. In other words, we prove that any\ncooperative game is a linear combination of iterated compositions of the\n2-player bargaining game and the 2-player dictator games. We show that many\ninteresting classes of games (simple, balanced, capacities a.k.a fuzzy measures\nand convex functions, totally monotone, etc) are stable under compositions, and\nthus form suboperads. In the convex case, this gives by the submodularity\ntheorem a new operad structure on the family of all generalized permutahedra.\nFinally, we focus on how solution concepts in cooperative game theory behave\nunder composition: we study the core of a composite and describe it in terms of\nthe core of its components, and we give explicit formulas for the Shapley value\nand the Banzhaf index of a compound game."}

The difficulty arises from complex system\nstructures, dense service coupling, and limited fault information. To solve\nthis problem, an intelligent identification algorithm based on transfer\nlearning is proposed. The method introduces a shared feature extraction module\nand a domain adversarial mechanism to enable effective knowledge transfer from\nthe source domain to the target domain. This improves the model's\ndiscriminative ability and generalization performance in the target domain. The\nmodel incorporates a pseudo-label selection strategy. When labeled samples are\nlacking in the target domain, high-confidence predictions are used in training.\nThis enhances the model's ability to recognize minority classes. To evaluate\nthe stability and adaptability of the method in real-world scenarios,\nexperiments are designed under three conditions: label scarcity, class\nimbalance, and heterogeneous node environments. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed method outperforms existing mainstream approaches in several key\nmetrics, including accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. The model demonstrates stronger\ndiscriminative power and robustness. Notably, under extreme class imbalance and\nsignificant structural differences in the target domain, the model still\nmaintains high performance. This validates the effectiveness and practical\nvalue of the proposed mechanisms in complex cloud computing systems."}

While economists often focus on immigrants' economic\noutcomes compared to natives (such as education, labor market success, and\nhealth) social interactions between immigrants and natives are equally crucial.\nThese interactions, from everyday exchanges to teamwork, often lack enforceable\ncontracts and require cooperation to avoid conflicts and achieve efficient\noutcomes. However, socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural differences can hinder\ncooperation. Thus, evaluating integration should also consider its impact on\nfostering cooperation across diverse groups. This paper studies how priming\ndifferent identity dimensions affects cooperation between immigrant and native\nyouth. Immigrant identity includes both ethnic ties to their country of origin\nand connections to the host country. We test whether cooperation improves by\nmaking salient a specific identity: Common identity (shared society),\nMulticultural identity (ethnic group within society), or Neutral identity. In a\nlab in the field experiment with over 390 adolescents, participants were\nrandomly assigned to one of these priming conditions and played a Public Good\nGame.

An essential component for modeling graph\nstructures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the\nalgorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the\nblock level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to\nfacilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks."}

We\ncontinuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and\ndemonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points\nin both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to\npre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised\nfine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that\nfull-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We\nshowcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the\nincrease in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.\nFinally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL\npipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy\nwith proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.\nRetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL\ntask and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented\nlanguage models."}

In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that\naddresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient\nand parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and\neffectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained\nmodels for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended\nbeyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available\nat https://github.com/dohoonkim-ai/DoMIX."}

Classical force fields are efficient\nbut lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details\ncritical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM)\nmethods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or\nlong-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level\naccuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity,\naccuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and\ninsufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we\nintroduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle\nAttention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with\nlinear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector\noperations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is\na robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset\nfor broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated\nsystem simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across\nmost evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading\nmodels such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer.

To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment\n(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a\ndrift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of\ndrifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number\nof up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new\ndistribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while\nreducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.\n  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants\nof standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and\nTiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted\nrepresentations.

We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations.

Among them,\npedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the\nmost popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or\nappearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex\nscenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often\nprevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,\nnon-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial\nvisibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform\ntracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,\nthe existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods\nmainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and\nnon-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing\ndataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from\nadequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale\ndataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view\nand all from real-life complex scenarios.

However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement.

We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have\naddressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual\nframework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance\nselection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the\nintegration of large language models (LLM) as annotators.

The emergence of reasoning-capable\nmodels has further widened the cost gap between \"thinking\" (high reasoning) and\n\"non-thinking\" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that\napproximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the\nnon-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.\nThis highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that\ndynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could\noptimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,\nwe further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing\nframework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or\nnon-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets\ndemonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.\n0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by\n36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis\nindicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays\nand even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.\nFinally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index\nto comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token\ncost."}

In particular, a\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO\ntransmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight\n(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal\ncodewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and\ntime-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier\ntransform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating\namplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the\ndiscrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant\ncomputation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network\n(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection.

To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss\nreward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the\nexternal reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,\nenabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration\nstagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across\nsix mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization\nand excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks."}

These shortcuts arise from a\nfundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations\nof the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer\nmatching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it\ngenerate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the\nreference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach.
