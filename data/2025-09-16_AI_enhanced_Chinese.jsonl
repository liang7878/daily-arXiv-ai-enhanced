Yet, achieving high\nperformance for both reads and writes is challenging due to traditionally\nlimited memory and the pick-any-two-out-of-three tradeoff between memory use,\nread performance, and write performance. Existing state-of-the-art approaches\nlimit memory usage and chose a primary dimension (reads or writes) for which to\noptimize their on-disk structures. They recover performance in the remaining\ndimension by other mechanisms. This approach limits databases' maximum\nperformance in the remaining dimension and their dynamic (online) tunability to\nrespond to changing workloads. We explore a different approach that dynamically\ntrades memory for read or write performance as needed. We present TurtleKV,\nwhich includes a novel unbiased data structure for on-disk storage. It includes\na knob that dynamically increases memory reserved for increasing read or write\nperformance.

With multicore architectures becoming\ncommonplace, traditional prefetchers are severely challenged. Independent core\noperation creates significant redundancy (up to 20% of prefetch requests are\nduplicates), causing unnecessary memory bus traffic and wasted bandwidth.\nFurthermore, cutting-edge prefetchers such as Pythia suffer from about a 10%\nperformance loss when scaling from a single-core to a four-core system. To\nsolve these problems, we propose CRL-Pythia, a coordinated reinforcement\nlearning based prefetcher specifically designed for multicore systems. In this\nwork, CRL-Pythia addresses these issues by enabling cross-core sharing of\ninformation and cooperative prefetching decisions, which greatly reduces\nredundant prefetch requests and improves learning convergence across cores. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that CRL-Pythia outperforms single Pythia\nconfigurations in all cases, with approximately 12% IPC (instructions per\ncycle) improvement for bandwidth-constrained workloads, while imposing moderate\nhardware overhead. Our sensitivity analyses also verify its robustness and\nscalability, thereby making CRL-Pythia a practical and efficient solution to\ncontemporary multicore systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684CRL - Pythia\u9884\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u9002\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u53d6\u5668\u5728\u591a\u6838\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u6709\u5197\u4f59\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u6d6a\u8d39\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u524d\u6cbf\u9884\u53d6\u5668\u5728\u591a\u6838\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u8c03\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684CRL - Pythia\u9884\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6838\u5fc3\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u9884\u53d6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "CRL - Pythia\u5728\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355Pythia\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7dIPC\u63d0\u5347\u7ea612%\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u9002\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "CRL - Pythia\u662f\u5f53\u4ee3\u591a\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We implement and evaluate the RI-based variable selection\nmethods using general dominance (GD), comprehensive relative importance (CRI),\nand a newly proposed, computationally efficient variant termed CRI.Z.\n  We first demonstrate how the RI measures more accurately rank the variables\nthan the marginal correlation, especially when there are suppressed or weak\npredictors.

The core idea is to approximate the log-likelihood function\nusing Gaussian process (GP) regression in a streamlined Bayesian active\nlearning way. Rather than generating many samples from the posterior GP, we\nonly use its mean and variance function to form the model evidence estimator,\nstopping criterion, and learning function. Specifically, the estimation of\nmodel evidence is first treated as a Bayesian cubature problem, with a GP prior\nassigned over the log-likelihood function. Second, a plug-in estimator for\nmodel evidence is proposed based on the posterior mean function of the GP.\nThird, an upper bound on the expected absolute error between the posterior\nmodel evidence and its plug-in estimator is derived. Building on this result, a\nnovel stopping criterion and learning function are proposed using only the\nposterior mean and standard deviation functions of the GP. Finally, we can\nobtain the model evidence based on the posterior mean function of the\nlog-likelihood function in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation, as well as\nthe samples for the posterior distribution of model parameters as a by-product.\nFour numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and\nefficiency of the proposed method compared to several existing approaches.

We investigate how a coordinator can learn a\ncorrelated equilibrium in convex games where each player minimizes a convex\ncost function that depends on other players' actions, subject to convex\nconstraints without knowledge of the players' cost functions. We propose a\nlearning framework that learns an approximate correlated equilibrium by\nactively querying players' regrets, \\emph{i.e.}, the cost saved by deviating\nfrom the coordinator's recommendations. We first show that a correlated\nequilibrium in convex games corresponds to a joint action distribution over an\ninfinite joint action space that minimizes all players' regrets. To make the\nlearning problem tractable, we introduce a heuristic that selects finitely many\nrepresentative joint actions by maximizing their pairwise differences.

However, these two stages are optimized for\ndifferent objectives: semantic reconstruction during tokenizer pretraining\nversus user interaction modeling during recommender training. This objective\nmisalignment leads to two key limitations: (i) suboptimal static tokenization,\nwhere fixed token assignments fail to reflect diverse usage contexts; and (ii)\ndiscarded pretrained semantics, where pretrained knowledge - typically from\nlanguage model embeddings - is overwritten during recommender training on user\ninteractions.

First, we estimated\nexpenditure in Australia for prevention vs treatment pathways to achieve SDG\ntarget 3.4. Second, we applied the method to 34 other OECD countries.\n  Methods: We used GBD data to estimate average annual percentage changes in\ndisease incidence, remission, and CFRs from 1990-2021, and projected to 2030 to\nestimate business-as-usual (BAU) reductions in NCD mortality risk (40q30). For\ncountries not on track to meet SDG3.4 under BAU, we modelled two intervention\nscenarios commencing in 2022 to achieve SDG3.4: (1) prevention via accelerated\nincidence reduction; (2) treatment via accelerated increases in remission and\ndecreases in CFRs. Australian disease expenditure data were input into a PMSLT\nmodel to estimate expenditure changes from 2022 to 2040. Assuming similar\nexpenditure patterns, the method was applied across OECD countries.\n  Findings: In Australia, current trends project a 25% reduction in 40q30 by\n2030, short of the 33.3% SDG3.4 target. Achieving this requires a 2.53\npercentage point (pp) annual acceleration in incidence decline (prevention) or\n1.56pp acceleration in CFR reduction and remission increase (treatment).\nPrevention reduces disease expenditure by 0.72%-3.17% by 2030 and 2040;\ntreatment initially increase expenditure by 0.16%, before reducing it by 0.98%.\nA treatment scenario reducing only CFRs increased expenditure initially;\nincreasing remission alone achieved savings similar to prevention. Only Sweden,\nIreland, and South Korea were on track to meet SDG3.4.

This broad setting induces\nexpressive vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that\ngeneralize the classical $K=kI$ paradigm, thereby enabling rich structural\nmodeling with rigorous theoretical guarantees. To address target operators\nlying outside the RKHS, we introduce vector-valued interpolation spaces to\nprecisely quantify misspecification error. Within this framework, we establish\ndimension-free polynomial convergence rates, demonstrating that nonlinear\noperator learning can overcome the curse of dimensionality. The use of general\noperator-valued kernels further allows us to derive rates for intrinsically\nnonlinear operator learning, going beyond the linear-type behavior inherent in\ndiagonal constructions of $K=kI$.

PRS Release Number: 25-0864", "summary": "New technologies in generative AI can enable deeper analysis into our\nnation's supply chains but truly informative insights require the continual\nupdating and aggregation of massive data in a timely manner. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) offer unprecedented analytical opportunities however, their\nknowledge base is constrained to the models' last training date, rendering\nthese capabilities unusable for organizations whose mission impacts rely on\nemerging and timely information. This research proposes an innovative approach\nto supply chain analysis by integrating emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping\ntechnologies. Our method aims to reduce latency in incorporating new\ninformation into an augmented-LLM, enabling timely analysis of supply chain\ndisruptors. Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial\neffects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our\nresults suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis,\nfine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most\nsignificant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of\nretrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts\nretrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on\ncomplex supply chain queries.

However, denominating in\nnon-interest-bearing stablecoins introduces inefficiencies: participants face\nopportunity costs relative to the fiat risk-free rate, and Bitcoin holders in\nparticular lose exposure to BTC appreciation when converting into stablecoins.\nThis paper explores the case for prediction markets denominated in Bitcoin,\ntreating BTC as a deflationary settlement asset analogous to gold under the\nclassical gold standard. We analyse three methods of supplying liquidity to a\nnewly created BTC-denominated prediction market: cross-market making against\nexisting stablecoin venues, automated market making, and DeFi-based redirection\nof user trades. For each approach we evaluate execution mechanics, risks\n(slippage, exchange-rate risk, and liquidation risk), and capital efficiency.\nOur analysis shows that cross-market making provides the most user-friendly\nrisk profile, though it requires active professional makers or\nplatform-subsidised liquidity.

We\npropose a novel segmentation method where subseries end at relative maxima,\nidentified when the price increase from the preceding minimum surpasses a\nthreshold, thus capturing significant upward movements, which act as key\nmarkers for the end of a growth phase, while potentially filtering the noise.\nCrucially, the fixed-length pattern ending each subseries determines the\ncategory assigned to the subsequent variable-length subseries, grouping typical\nmarket responses that follow similar preceding conditions. A distinct TFT model\ntrained for each category is specialized in predicting the evolution of these\nsubsequent subseries based on their initial steps after the preceding peak.\nExperimental results on ETH-USDT 10-minute data over a two-month test period\ndemonstrate that our adaptive approach significantly outperforms baseline\nfixed-length TFT and LSTM models in prediction accuracy and simulated trading\nprofitability. Our combination of adaptive segmentation and pattern-conditioned\nforecasting enables more robust and responsive cryptocurrency price prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94TFT\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u77ed\u671f\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u5e02\u573a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) \u8fdb\u884c\u77ed\u671f\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u5e02\u573a\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94TFT\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u76f8\u5bf9\u6700\u5927\u503c\u7ed3\u675f\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u540c\u7684TFT\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ETH - USDT 10\u5206\u949f\u6570\u636e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6708\u6d4b\u8bd5\u671f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u4ea4\u6613\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6TFT\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Given a directed graph $G$ and integers\n$d$ and $k$, the standard problem asks whether $G$ contains a packing of\nvertex-disjoint cycles, each of length $\\leq d$, covering at least $k$ vertices\nin total. In the multi-agent setting we consider, the vertex set is partitioned\nover several agents who reject a cycle packing as solution if it can be\nmodified into an alternative packing that covers more of their own vertices. A\ncycle packing is called rejection-proof if no agent rejects it and the problem\nasks whether such a packing exists that covers at least $k$ vertices.\n  We exploit the sunflower lemma on a set packing formulation of the problem to\ngive a kernel for this $\\Sigma_2^P$-complete problem that is polynomial in $k$\nfor all constant values of $d$. We also provide a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k \\log k)} +\nn^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ algorithm based on it and show that this FPT algorithm is\nasymptotically optimal under the ETH. Further, we generalize the problem by\nincluding an additional positive integer $c$ in the input that naturally\ncaptures how much agents can modify a given cycle packing to reject it. For\nevery constant $c$, the resulting problem simplifies from being\n$\\Sigma_2^P$-complete to NP-complete.

This paper introduces a\ntype-safe communication framework for MPI, built on the RSMPI library, to\naddress the limitations of traditional MPI programming.

The framework supports both single-value and slice-based\ncommunication, providing an intuitive API for diverse data structures.

This approach aims to improve the\neffectiveness and efficiency of vulnerability detection and mitigation through\na flexible framework that incorporates dynamic adjustments and considers the\ntemporal aspects of vulnerability exposure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9SQL\u6ce8\u5165\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u4f4d\u5217\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u6f0f\u6d1e\u524d\u4e09\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5148\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u654f\u6377\u5f00\u53d1\u5468\u671f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u7eed\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\u5b9a\u5236\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u6f0f\u6d1e\u66b4\u9732\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Illiquidity, characterized by wide bid and ask spreads\naffects price formation by decoupling prices from standard risk and return\nrelationships and increasing sensitivity to market sentiment. We model the\nprices at the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) which is illiquid in that the\nprices remain constant much of the time thus complicating price modelling. We\ncircumvent this challenge by combining the Markov model (MM) with two models;\nthe exponential Ornstein Uhlenbeck model (XOU) and geometric Brownian motion\n(gBm). In the combined models, the MM was used to capture the constant prices\nin the stock prices while the XOU and gBm captured the stochastic price\ndynamics. We modelled stock prices using the combined models, as well as XOU\nand gBm alone. We found that USE stocks appeared to have low correlation with\none another. Using theoretical analysis, simulation study and empirical\nanalysis, we conclude that this apparent low correlation is due to illiquidity.\nIn particular data simulated from combined MM-gBm, in which the gBm portion\nwere highly correlated resulted in a low measured correlation when the Markov\nchain had a higher transition from zero state to zero state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e4c\u5e72\u8fbe\u8bc1\u5238\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u975e\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u80a1\u7968\u4ef7\u683c\u884c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u80a1\u7968\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u975e\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0a\u5e02\u80a1\u7968\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u975e\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u80a1\u7968\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u975e\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u4ef7\u683c\u5f62\u6210\u4e14\u4f7f\u4ef7\u683c\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6307\u6570\u5965\u6069\u65af\u5766 - \u4e4c\u4f26\u8d1d\u514b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u7528\u540e\u4e24\u8005\u5355\u72ec\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4e4c\u5e72\u8fbe\u8bc1\u5238\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u80a1\u7968\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80a1\u7968\u7684\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u662f\u7531\u975e\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\uff0c\u5982\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u4ece\u96f6\u72b6\u6001\u5230\u96f6\u72b6\u6001\u8fc7\u6e21\u8f83\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u91cf\u51fa\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

Modeling the\ngenotype distribution is challenging, as it ultimately requires tracking all\ncorrelations (or cumulants) among alleles at different loci. The quasi-linkage\nequilibrium (QLE) approximation simplifies this by assuming that correlations\nbetween alleles at different loci are weak -- i.e., low linkage disequilibrium\n-- allowing their dynamics to be modeled perturbatively. However, QLE breaks\ndown under strong selection, significant epistatic interactions, or weak\nrecombination. We extend the multilocus QLE framework to allow cumulants up to\norder $K$ to evolve dynamically, while higher-order cumulants ($>K$) are\nassumed to equilibrate rapidly. This extended QLE (exQLE) framework yields a\ngeneral equation of motion for cumulants up to order $K$, which parallels the\nstandard QLE dynamics (recovered when $K = 1$). In this formulation, cumulant\ndynamics are driven by the gradient of average fitness, mediated by a\ngeometrically interpretable matrix that stems from competition among genotypes.\nOur analysis shows that the exQLE with $K=2$ accurately captures cumulant\ndynamics even when the fitness function includes higher-order (e.g., third- or\nfourth-order) epistatic interactions, capabilities that standard QLE lacks. We\nalso applied the exQLE framework to infer fitness parameters from temporal\nsequence data.

Instead of analyzing all behaviors of a program, these techniques\ndetect errors by focusing on a single program execution. Often a crucial step\nin these techniques is to define a causal ordering between events in the\nexecution, which is then computed using vector clocks, a simple data structure\nthat stores logical times of threads. The two basic operations of vector\nclocks, namely join and copy, require $\\Theta(k)$ time, where $k$ is the number\nof threads. Thus they are a computational bottleneck when $k$ is large.\n  In this work, we introduce tree clocks, a new data structure that replaces\nvector clocks for computing causal orderings in program executions. Joining and\ncopying tree clocks takes time that is roughly proportional to the number of\nentries being modified, and hence the two operations do not suffer the a-priori\n$\\Theta(k)$ cost per application. We show that when used to compute the classic\nhappens-before (HB) partial order, tree clocks are optimal, in the sense that\nno other data structure can lead to smaller asymptotic running time.

Based on\ndata from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) for the period\n2016-2019, I adopted a difference-in-differences event study approach by\ncomparing results in 41 FEMA-designated disaster counties with a set of\nunaffected southern control counties. I find that Hurricane Harvey had a large\nand long-lasting impact on labor market outcomes in the construction industry.\nMore precisely, average log wages in treated counties rose by around 7.2\npercent compared to control counties two quarters after the hurricane and\nremained high for the next two years. Employment effects were more gradual,\nshowing a statistically significant increase only after six quarters, in line\nwith the lagged nature of large-scale reconstruction activities.

While cloud providers employ spot instances to reduce\ncosts for low-priority (LP) tasks, existing schedulers still grapple with high\neviction rates and lengthy queuing times. To address these limitations, we\npresent GFS, a novel preemptive scheduling framework that enhances\nservice-level objective (SLO) compliance for high-priority (HP) tasks while\nminimizing preemptions to LP tasks. Firstly, GFS utilizes a lightweight\nforecasting model that predicts GPU demand among different tenants, enabling\nproactive resource management. Secondly, GFS employs a dynamic allocation\nmechanism to adjust the spot quota for LP tasks with guaranteed durations.\nLastly, GFS incorporates a preemptive scheduling policy that prioritizes HP\ntasks while minimizing the impact on LP tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof GFS through both real-world implementation and simulations.

SPARK first employs\nTucker low-rank decomposition to denoise KGs and generate robust entity\nrepresentations. Subsequently, an SVD-initialized hybrid geometric GNN\nconcurrently learns representations in Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces; the\nlatter is strategically leveraged for its aptitude in modeling hierarchical\nstructures, effectively capturing semantic features of sparse, long-tail items.\nA core contribution is an item popularity-aware adaptive fusion strategy that\ndynamically weights signals from collaborative filtering, refined KG\nembeddings, and diverse geometric spaces for precise modeling of both\nmainstream and long-tail items. Finally, contrastive learning aligns these\nmulti-source representations.

Our model optimizes\nresource allocation and revenue generation using a pair-bid mechanism and\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) pricing. The pair-bid approach enhances competition\nand efficiency, while VCG ensures truthful bidding based on marginal system\nimpact. Simulations validate the model's effectiveness in resource distribution\nand financial performance, showing a 12.5% revenue improvement over the\nbaseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u71265G\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u7ea7\u7ec4\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u6536\u76ca\u63d0\u534712.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b35G\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u4e2d\u516c\u5e73\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u529f\u7387\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u7ea7\u5c42\u6b21\u7ec4\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0a\u5c42MNO\u5411MVNO\u62cd\u5356\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u4e0b\u5c42MVNO\u5411\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u51fa\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\u548cVCG\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6536\u76ca\u63d0\u9ad812.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u53165G\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we first propose the concept, AI coding proficiency, the degree to which\nLLMs can utilize a given technology to generate high-quality code snippets. We\nconduct the first comprehensive empirical study examining AI proficiency across\n170 third-party libraries and 61 task scenarios, evaluating six widely used\nLLMs. Our findings reveal that libraries with similar functionalities can\nexhibit up to 84% differences in the quality score of LLM-generated code, while\ndifferent models also exhibit quality gaps among their generation results using\nthe same library. These gaps translate into real engineering costs and can\nsteer developer choices toward a narrow set of libraries with high AI coding\nproficiency, threatening technological diversity in the ecosystem. We call on\nthe community to integrate AI proficiency assessments into technology selection\nframeworks and develop mitigation strategies, preserving competitive balance in\nAI-driven development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAI\u7f16\u7801\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76170\u4e2a\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5e93\u548c61\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b6\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684AI\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e93\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u5c06AI\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7eb3\u5165\u6280\u672f\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u6808\u9009\u62e9\u672a\u8ddf\u4e0a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6240\u9009\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u56e2\u961f\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u52a9\u624b\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6280\u672f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u7f16\u7801\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5bf9170\u4e2a\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5e93\u548c61\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f306\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u529f\u80fd\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5e93\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u5f97\u5206\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u8fbe84%\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u5e93\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u547c\u5401\u793e\u533a\u5c06AI\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7eb3\u5165\u6280\u672f\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent\nanthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework.

Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant\nliterature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks,\nhighlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and\ngoal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems,\nwhile heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying\ncomputational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an\nalternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in\nsystem-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence.

This work focuses on the\nsynergy between Dual Reinforcement Learning Policies in the Minority Game\n(DRLP-MG) to optimize resource allocation. Our study examines a\nmixed-structured population with two sub-populations: a Q-subpopulation using\nQ-learning policy and a C-subpopulation adopting the classical policy. We first\nidentify a synergy effect between these subpopulations. A first-order phase\ntransition occurs as the mixing ratio of the subpopulations changes. Further\nanalysis reveals that the Q-subpopulation consists of two internal synergy\nclusters (IS-clusters) and a single external synergy cluster (ES-cluster). The\nformer contribute to the internal synergy within the Q-subpopulation through\nsynchronization and anti-synchronization, whereas the latter engages in the\ninter-subpopulation synergy. Within the ES-cluster, the classical momentum\nstrategy in the financial market manifests and assumes a crucial role in the\ninter-subpopulation synergy. This particular strategy serves to prevent\nlong-term under-utilization of resources. However, it also triggers trend\nreversals and leads to a decrease in rewards for those who adopt it. Our\nresearch reveals that the frozen effect, in either the C- or Q-subpopulation,\nis a crucial prerequisite for synergy, consistent with previous studies. We\nalso conduct mathematical analyses on subpopulation synergy effects and the\nsynchronization and anti-synchronization forms of IS-clusters in the\nQ-subpopulation.

Existing LLMs\nmainly employ autoregressive generation, i.e. generating code token-by-token\nfrom left to right. However, the underlying autoregressive generation has two\nlimitations in code generation. First, autoregressive LLMs only generate a\ntoken at each step, showing low efficiency in practice. Second, programming is\na non-sequential process involving back-and-forth editing, while autoregressive\nLLMs only employ the left-to-right generation order. These two intrinsic\nlimitations hinder the further development of LLMs in code generation.\nRecently, diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative. Diffusion\nLLMs address the above limitations with two advances, including multi-token\nprediction (i.e. generating multiple tokens at each step) and flexible\ngeneration order (i.e. flexibly determining which positions to generate\ntokens). However, there is no systematic study exploring diffusion LLMs in code\ngeneration. To bridge the knowledge gap, we present the first empirical study\nof diffusion LLMs for code generation.

Recent advancements leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has\ndrawn significant attention, particularly in two main categories: early feature\nselection and late feature selection, differentiated by whether the selection\noccurs before or after the embedding layer. The early feature selection selects\na fixed subset of features and retrains the model, while the late feature\nselection, known as adaptive feature selection, dynamically adjusts feature\nchoices for each data instance, recognizing the variability in feature\nsignificance. Although adaptive feature selection has shown remarkable\nimprovements in performance, its main drawback lies in its post-embedding layer\nfeature selection. This process often becomes cumbersome and inefficient in\nlarge-scale recommender systems with billions of ID-type features, leading to a\nhighly sparse and parameter-heavy embedding layer. To overcome this, we\nintroduce Adaptive Early Feature Selection (AEFS), a very simple method that\nnot only adaptively selects informative features for each instance, but also\nsignificantly reduces the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS\nemploys a dual-model architecture, encompassing an auxiliary model dedicated to\nfeature selection and a main model responsible for prediction. To ensure\neffective alignment between these two models, we incorporate two collaborative\ntraining loss constraints.

Then, we propose and\nanalyze a novel sampling algorithm based on Importance Sampling, proving tight\nsample size bounds to achieve high-quality approximations.\n  Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that PercIS computes high-quality\nestimates and scales to large real-world networks, while significantly\noutperforming, in terms of sample sizes, accuracy and running times, the\nstate-of-the-art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPercIS\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56fe\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6e17\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6e17\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b0\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5PercIS\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "PercIS\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u503c\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "PercIS\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6e17\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper\npresents a systematic literature review of 74 primary studies published between\n2023 and 2024, examining how LLMs are being applied in RE. The study\ncategorizes the literature according to several dimensions, including\npublication trends, RE activities, prompting strategies, and evaluation\nmethods. Our findings indicate notable patterns, among which we observe\nsubstantial differences compared to previous works leveraging standard Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) techniques. Most of the studies focus on using LLMs\nfor requirements elicitation and validation, rather than defect detection and\nclassification, which were dominant in the past. Researchers have also\nbroadened their focus and addressed novel tasks, e.g., test generation,\nexploring the integration of RE with other software engineering (SE)\ndisciplines. Although requirements specifications remain the primary focus,\nother artifacts are increasingly considered, including issues from issue\ntracking systems, regulations, and technical manuals. The studies mostly rely\non GPT-based models, and often use Zero-shot or Few-shot prompting.

Optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.DM", "cs.DS"], "comment": null, "summary": "Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks\ndue to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal\ndecision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization\ntask. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is\nNP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper\ndecision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four\nformal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four\ngeneric algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees\nsatisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties\nof hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial\nhypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed.\n  In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the\nalgorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the\nfirst hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our\nknowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to\nhyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on\ngeneral-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general\nhypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers.\n  Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision\ntrees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature\nnoise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more\naccurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise.\nWe also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets,\nshowing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the\nstate-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree\ncomplexity is properly controlled.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u5217\u8bba\u6587Part I\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff08HODT\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6bd4\u8f74\u5e73\u884c\u6811\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u6297\u566a\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65f6\u6bd4\u6700\u4f18\u8f74\u5e73\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7b97\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff08ODT\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u6709\u6311\u6218\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u88c2\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e00\u822c\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePart I\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHODT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f74\u5e73\u884c\u6811\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u6297\u566a\uff1b\u572830\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65f6\u6bd4\u6700\u4f18\u8f74\u5e73\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7b97\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad830%\u3002", "conclusion": "HODT\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u822c\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8f74\u5e73\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The use of Artificial\nintelligence (AI) in medical decision support systems is promising due to the\ntime- and expertise-intensive interpretation, however, due to the poor quality\nof existing data used for training AI models, their usability for real-world\napplications remains unclear. In a prospective study, we analyze data from 63\nCOVID-19 suspects (33 positive) collected at Maastricht University Medical\nCentre. Ultrasound recordings at six body locations were acquired following the\nBLUE protocol and manually labeled for severity of lung involvement. Several AI\nmodels were applied and trained for detection and severity of pulmonary\ninfection. The severity of the lung infection, as assigned by human annotators\nbased on the LUS videos, is not significantly different between COVID-19\npositive and negative patients (p = 0.89). Nevertheless, the predictions of\nimage-based AI models identify a COVID-19 infection with 65% accuracy when\napplied zero-shot (i.e., trained on other datasets), and up to 79% with\ntargeted training, whereas the accuracy based on human annotations is at most\n65%.

Recent\nexplosive growth in the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and their\nability to generate and translate code offers a potential alternative approach.\nToward that end, we first need to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs\nto translate between parallel languages.\n  In this work, we introduce UniPar, a systematic evaluation framework for\nLLM-based parallel code translation.

However, due to the high cost or privacy concerns,\nhigh-quality labeled data are scarce in real world scenarios. While few-shot\nlearning has shown promise in addressing data scarcity, existing methods still\nface significant limitations in this domain. Traditional data augmentation\ntechniques often suffer from mode collapse and generate low-quality samples\nthat fail to capture the diversity of bearing fault patterns. Moreover,\nconventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with local receptive fields\nmakes them inadequate for extracting global features from complex vibration\nsignals. Additionally, existing methods fail to model the intricate\nrelationships between limited training samples. To solve these problems, we\npropose an advanced data augmentation and contrastive fourier convolution\nframework (DAC-FCF) for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data. Firstly, a\nnovel conditional consistent latent representation and reconstruction\ngenerative adversarial network (CCLR-GAN) is proposed to generate more diverse\ndata. Secondly, a contrastive learning based joint optimization mechanism is\nutilized to better model the relations between the available training data.\nFinally, we propose a 1D fourier convolution neural network (1D-FCNN) to\nachieve a global-aware of the input data. Experiments demonstrate that DAC-FCF\nachieves significant improvements, outperforming baselines by up to 32\\% on\ncase western reserve university (CWRU) dataset and 10\\% on a self-collected\ntest bench.

Federated Learning\n(FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but its performance under\nnon-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) and imbalanced conditions\nrequires rigorous investigation. The study presents a comparative benchmark of\nfive federated learning strategies: FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad, FedAdam, and\nFedCluster for mortality prediction. Using the large-scale MIMIC-IV dataset, we\nsimulate a realistic non-IID environment by partitioning data by clinical care\nunit. To address the inherent class imbalance of the task, the SMOTE-Tomek\ntechnique is applied to each client's local training data. Our experiments,\nconducted over 50 communication rounds, reveal that the regularization-based\nstrategy, FedProx, consistently outperformed other methods, achieving the\nhighest F1-Score of 0.8831 while maintaining stable convergence.

However, recent research has revealed\ncritical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and\nunderstand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant\nchallenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code\nLLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning\nabout program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs\nactually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented\nrepresentation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across\nexisting methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason\neffectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic\napproaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these\nissues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic\ninformation~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct\na comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing\nthe reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on\ninvestigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting\nsupervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The\nexperimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate\nthat semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling\nof Code LLM.", "AI": {"tldr": "Code LLMs\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5bf9SFT\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "Code LLMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fd0\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u529f\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9Code LLMs\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u540e\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9Code LLMs\u7684SFT\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u63d0\u5347Code LLMs\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u50cf\u9884\u671f\u7684\u90a3\u4e48\u5927\u3002"}}

We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines\nthe mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the\nflexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the\nconcept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear\nfunctions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is\nmodeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation\nof the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based\nformalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which\nextends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the\nmathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC,\nwhich represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which\nuses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results\nshow that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple\npolynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator. In contrast,\nNN-CC demonstrates superior performance in modeling systems with complex\nnonlinearities and discontinuities, such as those observed in stick-slip\nsystems. The key contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the CC-based\nframework, particularly the NN-CC approach, can capture complex nonlinearities\nwhile maintaining interpretability through the explicit representation of the\nCCs.

However,\nAppMults introduce arithmetic errors into deep learning models, necessitating a\nretraining process to recover accuracy.

Traditional pruning approaches often depend on\nhand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to\nsuboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework\ntransforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the\ntarget neural network that captures complete topological relationships between\nlayers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a\nglobal view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph\nrepresentation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action\nspace we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary\naction spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance\ncriteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions.\nThese contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process\n(CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while\nadhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we\ndesign a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform\nits previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on\nbenchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The experiments\nshow that our method consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques,\nshowing state-of-the-art results while learning task-specific pruning\nstrategies that identify functionally redundant connections beyond simple\nweight magnitude considerations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u7a7a\u95f4\u96c6\u6210\u5230AutoML\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6b20\u4f73\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528GAT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u884c\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ece\u8fde\u7eed\u526a\u679d\u7387\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u884c\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5728CMDP\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u6211\u7ade\u4e89\u5956\u52b1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR - 10\u3001CIFAR - 100\u548cImageNet\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u6743\u91cd\u5927\u5c0f\u8003\u91cf\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5197\u4f59\u8fde\u63a5\u3002"}}

Drawing inspiration from\nthe theory of revealed preference, we formulate alignment as a two-stage\nproblem: constructing diverse agent personas called endowments that simulate\nplausible respondent profiles, and selecting a representative subset to\napproximate a ground-truth population based on observed data. To implement the\nparadigm, we introduce P2P, a system that steers LLM agents toward\nrepresentative behavioral patterns using structured prompt engineering,\nentropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection. Unlike\npersonalization-heavy approaches, our alignment approach is\ndemographic-agnostic and relies only on aggregate survey results, offering\nbetter generalizability and parsimony.

Traditional approaches to sensor\nselection often rely on linearized observability indices or statistical\ncorrelations that fail to capture the temporal evolution of complex systems. We\naddress this gap by leveraging liquid-time constant (LTC) networks,\ncontinuous-time neural architectures with input-dependent time constants, to\nsystematically identify and prune sensor inputs with minimal causal influence\non state estimation. Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training\nan LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact\nthrough controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible\neffect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate\nthis approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical\ndomains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear\ncontinuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the\nstructure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added\ncomplexity.

Our concentration guarantees hold universally for a broad class of\ndesign matrices and remain valid over long time horizons until algorithmic\nconvergence or divergence occurs. Moreover, our approach reveals that gradient\ndescent iterates are in general approximately independent of the data and\nstrongly incoherent with the feature vectors, a phenomenon previously known as\nthe `implicit regularization' effect of gradient descent in specific models\nunder Gaussian data.\n  As an illustration of the utility of our general theory, we present two\napplications of different natures in the regression setting.

Yet, most these\nsystems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of\nmanaging multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating\ncomplicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on\nadministration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large\nlanguage model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding\nand computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with\noperating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing\nagents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an\nabstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language\ninto machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a\nmore domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical\nguidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and\ncompliance. To address this need, we present \\textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified\nagent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract\nlayer for healthcare.

We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22\nspecialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically\nsound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and\nmedication recommendations.

In this paper, to support the\nhypothesis by Yarbus, we are decoding tasks categories while generating\nsynthetic data samples using well-known Synthetic Data Generators CTGAN and its\nvariations such as CopulaGAN and Gretel AI Synthetic Data generators on\navailable data from an in-person user study. Our results show that augmenting\nmore eye movement data combined with additional synthetically generated\nimproves classification accuracy even with traditional machine learning\nalgorithms. We see a significant improvement in task decoding accuracy from\n28.1% using Random Forest to 82% using Inception Time when five times more data\nis added in addition to the 320 real eye movement dataset sample. Our proposed\nframework outperforms all the available studies on this dataset because of the\nuse of additional synthetic datasets. We validated our claim with various\nalgorithms and combinations of real and synthetic data to show how decoding\naccuracy increases with the increase in the augmentation of generated data to\nreal data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u652f\u6301Yarbus\u5173\u4e8e\u53ef\u4ece\u773c\u52a8\u89e3\u7801\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CTGAN\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u7b49\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u589e\u52a0\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5982\u4f7f\u7528Inception Time\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece28.1%\u63d0\u5347\u523082%\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6269\u5145\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f1a\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u679c\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002"}}

Existing methods,\nhowever, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics,\nparticularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse\nbehaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling\nheterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global\ncontext, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each\nagent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and\ncomplex group-wise interactions (\\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or\npedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of\nagent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme\nand type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced,\ntype-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a\nprincipled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and\nexpressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset,\nHeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for\nkey metrics including Soft mAP and minADE.

Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured\ninformation (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and\nunstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this\nheterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine\nlearning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate\naccuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but\nstruggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data.

However, they often produce inaccurate or\nunreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly\nlimits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing\nneed for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this\nwork, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for\nhallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and\nthermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response\nto a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood\ntoken paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By\nanalyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under\nchanges in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic\nstability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying\nunstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is\ncomputationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the\nmodel's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural\nnetworks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical\ninterpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics.\nRemarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField\nachieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and\ndatasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684HalluField\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u8bba\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165HalluField\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u539f\u7406\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u4f3c\u7136\u6807\u8bb0\u8def\u5f84\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u71b5\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "HalluField\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u8f85\u52a9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6709\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u5efa\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0cHalluField\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, prior AI\nevaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted\nreasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.\n  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),\nwe conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create\nCPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and\nmultimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models\n(LLMs). Then, we developed \"Dr. CaBot,\" an AI discussant designed to produce\nwritten and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,\nmodeling the role of the human expert in these cases.\n  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the\nfinal diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,\noutperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached\n98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per\nunit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image\ntasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image\nchallenges.

A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to\nre-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic\nconstructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away\nfrom the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall\nfunctionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic\napproach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a\nframework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level\nstructure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing\nlower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to\nthe target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different\nways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in\nconjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,\nskeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual\nfragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically\ntranslated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a\nwhole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of\nskeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show\npromising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python\nprograms, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code\nfragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual\neffort.

A critical yet often\noverlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the\ntrust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few\nstudies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across\ngenerated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for\nevaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach\ngrounded in this metric.

This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online\nstore) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model\nupdates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby\npreserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing\nFL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data,\ndespite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to\nenrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this\nend, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform\ncollaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender\nsystem. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item\nlists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or\nlocally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of\nsparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional\nchallenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and\nirrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational\ncosts. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively\naugments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the\nglobal dataset.

Many existing Class\nIncremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually\nadapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial\ncomputational resources and complex, iterative training procedures.

CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several\nexisting, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature\nextractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer\nneural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor\neliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This,\ncombined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to\nperform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization\nprocess on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time\nwithout requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets\nconfirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the\nclassifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing\nstate-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and\nsustainability.

The 360{\\deg} video is encoded into\ndependent layers and segmented tiles, allowing a user to schedule downloads of\neach layer's segments. Furthermore, each user utilizes multiple buffers to\nstore the corresponding video layer's segments.

This paper focuses\non comparing different distributed adversarial training algorithms--including\ncentralized and decentralized strategies--within multi-agent learning\nenvironments. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of model\nflatness in determining robustness. To this end, we develop a general\ntheoretical framework to study the escaping efficiency of these algorithms from\nlocal minima, which is closely related to the flatness of the resulting models.\nWe show that when the perturbation bound is sufficiently small (i.e., when the\nattack strength is relatively mild) and a large batch size is used,\ndecentralized adversarial training algorithms--including consensus and\ndiffusion--are guaranteed to escape faster from local minima than the\ncentralized strategy, thereby favoring flatter minima. However, as the\nperturbation bound increases, this trend may no longer hold. In the simulation\nresults, we illustrate our theoretical findings and systematically compare the\nperformance of models obtained through decentralized and centralized\nadversarial training algorithms.

This is achieved by introducing a coding abstraction,\nwhich we call messageless secret-key codes, that formalizes sufficient and\nnecessary requirements of robust watermarking: soundness, tamper detection, and\npseudorandomness. Thus, we establish that robustness has a precise limit: For\nbinary outputs no scheme can survive if more than half of the encoded bits are\nmodified, and for an alphabet of size q the corresponding threshold is\n$(1-1/q)$ of the symbols.\n  Complementing this impossibility, we give explicit constructions that meet\nthe bound up to a constant slack. For every ${\\delta} > 0$, assuming\npseudorandom functions and access to a public counter, we build linear-time\ncodes that tolerate up to $(1/2)(1-{\\delta})$ errors in the binary case and\n$(1-1/q)(1-{\\delta})$ errors in the $q$-ary case.

Using\neligibility criteria from public real-world CTs, experienced annotators are\nhired to annotate TRIALQA to indicate (1) whether a social media user meets a\ngiven eligibility criterion and (2) the user's stated reasons for interest in\nparticipating in CT. We benchmark seven widely used LLMs on these two\nprediction tasks, employing six distinct training and inference strategies. Our\nextensive experiments reveal that, while LLMs show considerable promise, they\nstill face challenges in performing the complex, multi-hop reasoning needed to\naccurately assess eligibility criteria.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u52a9\u529b\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08CT\uff09\u62db\u52df\uff0c\u5f15\u5165TRIALQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e03\u79cdLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d44\u683c\u6807\u51c6\u65f6\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCT\u62db\u52df\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u53d7\u5730\u57df\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5927\u91cf\u5065\u5eb7\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684LLMs\u89e3\u51b3\u62db\u52df\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165TRIALQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7531\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u8005\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e03\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684LLMs\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u91c7\u7528\u516d\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d44\u683c\u6807\u51c6\u6240\u9700\u7684\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u53ef\u52a9\u529bCT\u62db\u52df\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d44\u683c\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

This paper\nintroduces the NRCD dataset, which provides insights into individual athlete\nprogressions, enabling data-driven decision-making. Analysis reveals that\nrunners' improvement per calendar day for women, racing 6,000m, and men, racing\n8,000m, is more pronounced in athletes with slower initial race times and those\nwho race more frequently. Additionally, we factor in course conditions,\nincluding weather and elevation gain, to standardize improvement. While the\nNRCD shows a gender imbalance, 3,484 men vs. 2,101 women, the racing frequency\nbetween genders is comparable.

However, their utility in image-based applications remains\nunexplored. We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks,\nspecifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their\nperformance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using\nthe BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a\ngeneral-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after\nfine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma\nclassification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and\nbalanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but\nsuffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors.\nFine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined\n(e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center\npoint, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately\nlocalized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs\nconsistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction\nof glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting\nbut failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon\nmethod yielded random, unstructured outputs.

Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their\nthought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to\nprovide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety\nAlignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason\nthrough direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety\ncapability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks.\nNotably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning\ncapabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our\nmethod equips models with the ability to perform safe completion.

Yet without transparency, black-box\ntraining cannot track noise already injected by previous clients and rounds,\nwhich forces worst-case additions and harms accuracy. We propose PrivateDFL, an\nexplainable framework that joins hyperdimensional computing with differential\nprivacy and keeps an auditable account of cumulative noise so each client adds\nonly the difference between the required noise and what has already been\naccumulated.

This study utilized 296 voyage reports from a bulk carrier vessel\nover one year (November 16, 2021 to November 21, 2022) and 28 parameters,\nintegrating hydrometeorological big data from the Copernicus Marine Environment\nMonitoring Service (CMEMS) with 19 parameters and the European Centre for\nMedium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with 61 parameters. The objective was to\nevaluate whether fusing external public data sources enhances modeling accuracy\nand to highlight the most influential parameters affecting fuel consumption.\nThe results reveal a strong potential for machine learning techniques to\npredict ship fuel consumption accurately by combining voyage reports with\nclimate and sea data. However, validation on similar classes of vessels remains\nnecessary to confirm generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u6563\u8d27\u8239\u822a\u884c\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u878d\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u8239\u8236\u71c3\u6cb9\u6d88\u8017\u5efa\u6a21\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u71c3\u6cb9\u6d88\u8017\u6f5c\u529b\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u66f4\u591a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fd\u9645\u6d77\u4e8b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63a8\u52a8\u51cf\u5c11\u8239\u8236\u71c3\u6cb9\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u9700\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u71c3\u6cb9\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u878d\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u5426\u63d0\u9ad8\u5efa\u6a21\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u6563\u8d27\u8239\u4e00\u5e74296\u4efd\u822a\u884c\u62a5\u544a\u548c28\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6574\u5408CMEMS\u548cECMWF\u7684\u6c34\u6587\u6c14\u8c61\u5927\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u822a\u884c\u62a5\u544a\u4e0e\u6c14\u5019\u3001\u6d77\u6d0b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u6f5c\u529b\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u8239\u8236\u71c3\u6cb9\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5728\u540c\u7c7b\u8239\u8236\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u786e\u8ba4\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often rely on simulated data or assumptions\nsuch as prior knowledge of fall events, limiting their real-world\napplicability. Practical deployment also requires efficient computation and\nrobust evaluation metrics tailored to continuous monitoring. This paper\npresents a real-time fall detection framework for continuous monitoring without\nprior knowledge of fall events. Using over 60 hours of inertial measurement\nunit (IMU) data from the FARSEEING real-world falls dataset, we employ recent\nefficient classifiers to compute fall probabilities in streaming mode. To\nenhance robustness, we introduce a cost-sensitive learning strategy that tunes\nthe decision threshold using a cost function reflecting the higher risk of\nmissed falls compared to false alarms.

The size of KV cache grows linearly as\nthe length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and\ndecoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize\nthe last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV\nimportance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models\nsuch as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks\nincluding LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an\nimprovement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on\nRULER.

We present an\nend-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to\nidentify broomrape-infested tomato fields in California. Regions of interest\nwere defined from farmer-reported infestations, and images with less than 10\npercent cloud cover were retained.

Recent work has introduced structural fidelity as a\ntabular-specific evaluation dimension to assess whether synthetic data complies\nwith the causal structures of real data. However, existing benchmarks often\nneglect the interplay between structural fidelity and conventional evaluation\ndimensions, thus failing to provide a holistic understanding of model\nperformance. Moreover, they are typically limited to toy datasets, as\nquantifying existing structural fidelity metrics requires access to\nground-truth causal structures, which are rarely available for real-world\ndatasets. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that jointly\nconsiders structural fidelity and conventional evaluation dimensions. We\nintroduce a new evaluation metric, $\\textbf{global utility}$, which enables the\nassessment of structural fidelity even in the absence of ground-truth causal\nstructures. In addition, we present $\\textbf{TabStruct}$, a comprehensive\nevaluation benchmark offering large-scale quantitative analysis on 13 tabular\ngenerators from nine distinct categories, across 29 datasets.

This study used electroencephalography\n(EEG) to compare how people process humor from AI versus human sources.\nBehavioral analysis revealed that participants rated AI and human humor as\ncomparably funny. However, neurophysiological data showed that AI humor\nelicited a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced cognitive effort during the\nprocessing of incongruity. This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive\nPotential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional\nresponse. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial\nexpectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities. Furthermore, a key temporal\ndynamic emerged: human humor showed habituation effects, marked by an\nincreasing N400 and a decreasing LPP over time. In contrast, AI humor\ndemonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a\ndecreasing N400 and an increasing LPP. This trajectory reveals how the brain\ncan dynamically update its predictive model of AI capabilities.

Additionally, participants' social attitudes\ntoward AI modulated these neural responses, with higher perceived AI\ntrustworthiness correlating with enhanced emotional engagement.

For example, during the dot-com bubble, innovative\ntechnologies created market disruptions through excitement for a promised\nbright future. Such technologies originated from research where scientists had\ndeveloped them for years prior to their entry into the markets. That raises a\nquestion on the possibility of analyzing scientific publishing data (e.g.\ncitation networks) leading up to a bubble for signals that may forecast the\nrise and fall of similar future bubbles. To that end, we utilized temporal SNAs\nto detect possible relationships between the publication citation networks of\nscientists and financial market data during two modern eras of rapidly shifting\ntechnology: 1) dot-com era from 1994 to 2001 and 2) AI era from 2017 to 2024.\nResults showed that the patterns from the dot-com era (which did end in a\nbubble) did not definitively predict the rise and fall of an AI bubble. While\nyearly citation networks reflected possible changes in publishing behavior of\nscientists between the two eras, there was a subset of AI era scientists whose\npublication influence patterns mirrored those during the dot-com era. Upon\nfurther analysis using multiple analysis techniques (LSTM, KNN, AR X/GARCH),\nthe data seems to suggest two possibilities for the AI era: unprecedented form\nof financial bubble unseen or that no bubble exists.

This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to\nadapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental\nconditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP)\nframework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target\ncoverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline\nmethods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then,\nvalidate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying\nMonte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under\nTest (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of\nthe VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying\nthe model's robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408GNN\u4e0eACP\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u4f7f\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGNN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u6570\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u548cCV\u503c\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5929\u6c14\u56e0\u7d20\u8c03\u6574\u8fb9\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528ACP\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff1b\u5728SUMO\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u5e73\u5747\u884c\u9a76\u65f6\u95f4\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u533a\u95f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u4ea4\u901a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Connected and automated factories face growing cybersecurity risks\nthat can potentially cause interruptions and damages to physical operations.\nAmong these attacks, data-integrity attacks often involve sophisticated\nexploitation of vulnerabilities that enable an attacker to access and\nmanipulate the operational data and are hence difficult to detect with only\nexisting intrusion detection or model-based detection. This paper addresses the\nchallenges in utilizing existing side-channels to detect data-integrity attacks\nin robotic manufacturing processes by developing an online detection framework,\nViSTR-GP, that cross-checks encoder-reported measurements against a\nvision-based estimate from an overhead camera outside the controller's\nauthority. In this framework, a one-time interactive segmentation initializes\nSAM-Track to generate per-frame masks. A low-rank tensor-regression surrogate\nmaps each mask to measurements, while a matrix-variate Gaussian process models\nnominal residuals, capturing temporal structure and cross-joint correlations. A\nframe-wise test statistic derived from the predictive distribution provides an\nonline detector with interpretable thresholds. We validate the framework on a\nreal-world robotic testbed with synchronized video frame and encoder data,\ncollecting multiple nominal cycles and constructing replay attack scenarios\nwith graded end-effector deviations. Results on the testbed indicate that the\nproposed framework recovers joint angles accurately and detects data-integrity\nattacks earlier with more frequent alarms than all baselines.

We\ninvestigate early detection using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm)\nand ensemble machine learning. In a field experiment in Woodland, California,\nwe tracked 300 tomato plants across growth stages defined by growing degree\ndays (GDD). Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and\npreprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing,\ncorrelation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near\n1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf\nwater content in infected plants at early stages.

We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves\nmonotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We\nprovide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL\nalgorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC.

However, when the target signal\nlacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies,\ntraining suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to\nreconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie\nwithin the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in\nthe context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal\nrepresentation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting\nhigh-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To\neffectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we\npropose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER -\nweight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network\ninitialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian\nnoise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral\ncentroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide\ncontrol over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the\nempirical neural tangent kernel. This method not only addresses the spectral\nbottleneck but also yields faster convergence and with improved representation\naccuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in audio fitting and\nachieving notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks.

The DCASE 2024\nChallenge Task 1 highlights this issue by requiring models to learn from small\nlabeled subsets recorded on a few devices. These models need to then generalize\nto recordings from previously unseen devices under strict complexity\nconstraints. While techniques such as data augmentation and the use of\npre-trained models are well-established for improving model generalization,\noptimizing the training strategy represents a complementary yet less-explored\npath that introduces no additional architectural complexity or inference\noverhead. Among various training strategies, curriculum learning offers a\npromising paradigm by structuring the learning process from easier to harder\nexamples. In this work, we propose an entropy-guided curriculum learning\nstrategy to address the domain shift problem in data-efficient ASC.\nSpecifically, we quantify the uncertainty of device domain predictions for each\ntraining sample by computing the Shannon entropy of the device posterior\nprobabilities estimated by an auxiliary domain classifier. Using entropy as a\nproxy for domain invariance, the curriculum begins with high-entropy samples\nand gradually incorporates low-entropy, domain-specific ones to facilitate the\nlearning of generalizable representations. Experimental results on multiple\nDCASE 2024 ASC baselines demonstrate that our strategy effectively mitigates\ndomain shift, particularly under limited labeled data conditions.

In\nthis work, we introduce MEMBOT, a modular memory-based architecture designed to\naddress intermittent partial observability in robotic control tasks.

The belief\nencoder, implemented as a state-space model (SSM) and a LSTM, integrates\ntemporal sequences of observations and actions to infer latent state\nrepresentations that persist even when observations are dropped. We train and\nevaluate MEMBOT on 10 robotic manipulation benchmark tasks from MetaWorld and\nRobomimic under varying rates of observation dropout.

The model is trained\nin two stages; pretraining on residual Helmholtz energy followed by pressure\nfine-tuning with a stability penalty; and evaluated via single-phase\ninterpolation tests, solver-free derivative-quality diagnostics, an audited VLE\ndriver, and a latency benchmark. Within its regime, the GNN interpolates\nsingle-phase properties reasonably well; however, the VLE driver accepts no GNN\nequilibria on tested binaries (all plotted VLE points are CoolProp fallback or\nthe solver fails), and diagnostic probes reveal jagged P(V|T) paths and\nthermal-stability flags concentrated in dense/cold regions, indicating\ninsufficient derivative smoothness/consistency for robust equilibrium solving.\nAn end-to-end timing comparison shows no single-phase speed advantage relative\nto CoolProp (tens of milliseconds vs sub-millisecond).

Existing frameworks lack clarity on how regulations\ntranslate into conformity mechanisms, leading to gaps in compliance and\nenforcement.

By narrowing its scope through\nprogressively focused layers, the framework provides a structured pathway to\nmeet technical, regulatory, and ethical requirements. Its applicability is\nvalidated through two case studies on AI fairness and AI incident reporting.\n  Findings: The case studies demonstrate the framework's ability to identify\ngaps in legal mandates, standardization, and implementation. It adapts to both\nglobal and region-specific AI governance needs, mapping regulatory mandates\nwith practical applications to improve compliance and risk management.\n  Practical Implications - By offering a clear and actionable roadmap, this\nwork contributes to global AI governance by equipping policymakers, regulators,\nand industry stakeholders with a model to enhance compliance and risk\nmanagement.\n  Social Implications: The framework supports the development of policies that\nbuild public trust and promote the ethical use of AI for the benefit of\nsociety.\n  Originality/Value: This study proposes a five-layer AI governance framework\nthat bridges high-level regulatory mandates and implementation guidelines.\nValidated through case studies on AI fairness and incident reporting, it\nidentifies gaps such as missing standardized assessment procedures and\nreporting mechanisms, providing a structured foundation for targeted governance\nmeasures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u5c42AI\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u5168\u7403AI\u6cbb\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u89c4\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5c06\u6cd5\u89c4\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5408\u89c4\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u5c42AI\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5e7f\u6cdb\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7AI\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548cAI\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62a5\u544a\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6388\u6743\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u5168\u7403\u548c\u5730\u533a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684AI\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5168\u7403AI\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdbAI\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u63aa\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In contrast, modern robotic control systems, like\nneural network policies trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), are highly\nspecialized for single environments. Because of this overfitting, they are\nknown to break down even under small differences like the Simulation-to-Reality\n(Sim2Real) gap and require system identification and retraining for even\nminimal changes to the system. In this work, we present RAPTOR, a method for\ntraining a highly adaptive foundation policy for quadrotor control. Our method\nenables training a single, end-to-end neural-network policy to control a wide\nvariety of quadrotors. We test 10 different real quadrotors from 32 g to 2.4 kg\nthat also differ in motor type (brushed vs. brushless), frame type (soft vs.\nrigid), propeller type (2/3/4-blade), and flight controller\n(PX4/Betaflight/Crazyflie/M5StampFly). We find that a tiny, three-layer policy\nwith only 2084 parameters is sufficient for zero-shot adaptation to a wide\nvariety of platforms. The adaptation through In-Context Learning is made\npossible by using a recurrence in the hidden layer. The policy is trained\nthrough a novel Meta-Imitation Learning algorithm, where we sample 1000\nquadrotors and train a teacher policy for each of them using Reinforcement\nLearning. Subsequently, the 1000 teachers are distilled into a single, adaptive\nstudent policy. We find that within milliseconds, the resulting foundation\npolicy adapts zero-shot to unseen quadrotors. We extensively test the\ncapabilities of the foundation policy under numerous conditions (trajectory\ntracking, indoor/outdoor, wind disturbance, poking, different propellers).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRAPTOR\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c0f\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u77e5\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0b\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRAPTOR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5143\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u68371000\u4e2a\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u5e76\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6559\u5e08\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u5176\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u751f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ec52084\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e09\u5c42\u5c0f\u7b56\u7565\u8db3\u4ee5\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5728\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u77e5\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RAPTOR\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Although existing hallucination\ndetection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with\ndisentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To\naddress these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via\nreasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP\nestablishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct\nsum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes\nlinguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these\nsubspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its\nparameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are\nobtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the\nreasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input\nfeatures for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP\nreduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original,\nfilters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness.

Classical Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is typically formulated as\nanswering one single question by actively exploring a 3D environment. Real\ndeployments, however, often demand handling multiple questions that may arrive\nasynchronously and carry different urgencies. We formalize this setting as\nEmbodied Questions Answering (EQsA) and present ParaEQsA, a framework for\nparallel, urgency-aware scheduling and answering. ParaEQsA leverages a group\nmemory module shared among questions to reduce redundant exploration, and a\npriority-planning module to dynamically schedule questions. To evaluate this\nsetting, we contribute the Parallel Asynchronous Embodied Questions (PAEQs)\nbenchmark containing 40 indoor scenes and five questions per scene (200 in\ntotal), featuring asynchronous follow-up questions and urgency labels. We\nfurther propose metrics for EQsA performance: Direct Answer Rate (DAR), and\nNormalized Urgency-Weighted Latency (NUWL), which jointly measure efficiency\nand responsiveness of this system.

We introduce a probabilistic verification\nframework that is both architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional\noutputs.

To counteract CI's limitations in\nhigh-dimensional settings, we propose novel strategies that reduce conservatism\nwithout compromising rigor. Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation\nmodels across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrates\nthat our method provides reliable safety guarantees while substantially\ntightening bounds compared to SOTA.

This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model\nfor incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal\ninformation, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing\nprocess. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and\nlocal scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene\nreconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that\nGNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g.,\nCLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for\ncomplex, real-world environments.

However, the extent to which\nthis high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from\na Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as\nLLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a\ndataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians\npursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate\nand compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the\nfine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice\nquestion-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12\nmedical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including\nmedgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific\nprompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient\nfine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it\nutilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS:\nmedgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of\ncorrect answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion\nparameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results\n<50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all\nLLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters\nacross various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and\nresearch that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those\nexhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties\nshould utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u79d8\u9c81\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u4f7f\u7528medgemma-27b-text-it\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684medgemma-4b-it\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u62c9\u4e01\u7f8e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u62c9\u4e01\u7f8e\u6d32\u9010\u6e10\u6d41\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u542b8380\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684PeruMedQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u90098\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u5fae\u8c03medgemma-4b-it\u3002", "result": "medgemma-27b-text-it\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u60c5\u51b5\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8d8590%\uff1b\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e8e100\u4ebf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e60%\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684medgemma-4b-it\u80dc\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e8e100\u4ebf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0e700\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u56fd\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u53ca\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u79d8\u9c81\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u533b\u5b66AI\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528medgemma-27b-text-it\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684medgemma-4b-it\u3002"}}

The method was tested on the\npublicly available LIDC-IDRI dataset (1,018 CT scans).\n  Results: The proposed approach demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot\nlung nodule analysis. The CADe module achieved a Dice score of 0.92 and an IoU\nof 0.85 for nodule segmentation. The CADx module attained a specificity of 0.97\nfor malignancy classification, surpassing existing fully supervised methods.\n  Conclusions: The integration of VLMs with radiomics and synthetic EMRs allows\nfor accurate and clinically relevant CAD of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. The\nproposed system shows strong potential to enhance early lung cancer detection,\nincrease diagnostic confidence, and improve patient management in routine\nclinical workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u80ba\u90e8\u7ed3\u8282\uff0c\u5728LIDC - IDRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u80ba\u764c\u65e9\u68c0\u3002", "motivation": "\u80ba\u764c\u56e0\u8bca\u65ad\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5dee\u81f4\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u80ba\u90e8\u7ed3\u8282\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aefCAD\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u4e8eSAM2\u548cCLIP\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5f97\u5206\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u7535\u5b50\u75c5\u5386\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u7ec8\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728LIDC - IDRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u8282Dice\u5206\u65700.92\u3001IoU 0.85\uff0c\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u5757\u6076\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u7279\u5f02\u60270.97\uff0c\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u548c\u5408\u6210\u7535\u5b50\u75c5\u5386\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u51c6\u786eCAD\u80ba\u90e8\u7ed3\u8282\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u80ba\u764c\u65e9\u68c0\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u5fc3\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

These publicly shared\ndiscussions offer an organic view of user expectations, frustrations, and\nsuccess stories shaped by the specific contexts of use.

The lack of structure and\nspecialized vocabulary makes it difficult for traditional data analysis\ntechniques to accurately interpret, categorize, and quantify the feedback,\nthereby limiting its potential to inform product development and support\nstrategies. To address these challenges, this paper presents the User\neXperience Perception Insights Dataset (UXPID), a collection of 7130\nartificially synthesized and anonymized user feedback branches extracted from a\npublic industrial automation forum. Each JavaScript object notation (JSON)\nrecord contains multi-post comments related to specific hardware and software\nproducts, enriched with metadata and contextual conversation data. Leveraging a\nlarge language model (LLM), each branch is systematically analyzed and\nannotated for UX insights, user expectations, severity and sentiment ratings,\nand topic classifications. The UXPID dataset is designed to facilitate research\nin user requirements, user experience (UX) analysis, and AI-driven feedback\nprocessing, particularly where privacy and licensing restrictions limit access\nto real-world data.

Our results show that PINNs can reconstruct both the system\ndynamics and the functional form of unknown noise parameters, presenting a\nsample-efficient and scalable solution for quantum device characterization.\nUltimately, our method produces a fully-differentiable digital twin of a noisy\nquantum system by learning its governing master equation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINNs\uff09\u8fdb\u884cLindblad\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u8017\u6563\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u8868\u5f81\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Lindblad\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u5d4c\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u8017\u6563\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "PINNs\u80fd\u91cd\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u53ef\u5fae\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To approach this\ndifficulty, this paper aims to develop new modeling, analysis, and synthesis\ntools for AI-based AVs. Inspired by recent developments in perception error\nmodels (PEMs), the focus is shifted from directly modeling AI-based perception\nprocesses to characterizing the perception errors they produce. Two key classes\nof AI-induced perception errors are considered: misdetection and measurement\nnoise. These error patterns are modeled using continuous-time Markov chains and\nWiener processes, respectively. By means of that, a PEM-augmented driving model\nis proposed, with which we are able to establish the closed-loop stability for\na class of AI-driven AV systems via stochastic calculus. Furthermore, a\nperformance-guaranteed output feedback control synthesis method is presented,\nwhich ensures both stability and satisfactory performance.

A cost effective\nparadigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches\noften cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful\nways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a\ntext retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called\nRAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition\nLLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting\nand introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output\n(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References\n(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation\ntasks.

Prior\nmethods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and\nstatic objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this\npaper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3\nimages or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates\n360{\\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all\nviewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that\nHoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild\ngarments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles\nchallenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and\nocclusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture\ndetails, and accurate geometry.
