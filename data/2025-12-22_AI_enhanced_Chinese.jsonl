As such allocations may not exist for arbitrary instances, we ask if they exist for \\textit{typical} or \\textit{random} instances, meaning when the utility values of agents for the resources are drawn from certain distributions. If such allocations exist with high probability for typical instances, and furthermore if they can be computed efficiently, this would imply that we could quickly resolve a real world resource allocation scenario in a fair and efficient manner with high probability. This implication has made this setting popular and well studied in fair resource allocation.\n  In this paper, we extend the previously studied formal models of this problem to non-identical items. We assume that every item is associated with a distribution $\\mathcal{U}_j$, and every agent's utility value for the item is drawn independently from $\\mathcal{U}_j$. We show that envy-free fair and maximum social welfare efficient allocations exist with high probability in the asymptotic setting, meaning when the number of agents $n$ and items $m$ are large. Further we show that when $m=O(n\\log n),$ then by only sampling $O(\\log m)$ or $O((\\log m)^2)$ utility values per item instead of all the $n,$ we can compute these allocations in $\\tilde{O}(m)$ time. Finally, we simulate our algorithms on randomly generated instances and show that even for small instances, we suffer small multiplicative losses in the fairness and efficiency guarantees even for small sized instances, and converge to fully optimal guarantees quickly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u52a0\u6027\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u8d44\u6e90\u516c\u5e73\u6709\u6548\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4e0e\u5feb\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u975e\u76f8\u540c\u7269\u54c1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6e10\u8fd1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6709\u6548\u5206\u914d\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u5c0f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e5f\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u516c\u5e73\u6709\u6548\u5206\u914d\u5728\u5178\u578b\u6216\u968f\u673a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u53ca\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u76f8\u540c\u7269\u54c1\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7269\u54c1\u5173\u8054\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u6548\u7528\u503c\u72ec\u7acb\u62bd\u53d6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u90e8\u5206\u6548\u7528\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u6e10\u8fd1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u6700\u5927\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u5f53m = O(nlog n)\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728O~(m)\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u5c0f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0a\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u4e14\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u5178\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u627e\u5230\u516c\u5e73\u6709\u6548\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c0f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e5f\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While previous research has focused mostly on chain-based scheduling with ad-hoc response time analyses, we propose a novel approach using the events executor to implement fixed-job-level-priority schedulers for arbitrary ROS2 graphs on uniprocessor systems. We demonstrate that ROS 2 applications can be abstracted as forests of trees, enabling the mapping of ROS 2 applications to traditional real-time DAG task models. Our usage of the events executor requires a special implementation of the events queue and a communication middleware that supports LIFO-ordered message delivery, features not yet standard in ROS2. We show that our implementation generates the same schedules as a conventional fixed-priority DAG task scheduler, in spite of lacking access to the precedence information that usually is required.

Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u903b\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u56fe\u8fc7\u5927\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u201c\u7ebf\u6027\u201d\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d44\u6e90\u4e2d\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u652f\u6301\u5206\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u56fe\u8fc7\u5927\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u68c0\u67e5\u56fe\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7ec4\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u53ef\u6bd4\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u6216\u76f8\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u9650\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u3002"}}

These demands restrict development to a small number of highly specialized engineers. This thesis aims to democratize cloud application development by addressing three challenges: programmability, high-performance fault-tolerant serializable transactions, and serverless semantics.\n  The thesis identifies strong parallels between cloud applications and the streaming dataflow execution model. It first explores this connection through T-Statefun, a transactional extension of Apache Flink Statefun, demonstrating that dataflow systems can support transactional cloud applications via a stateful functions-as-a-service API. However, this approach revealed significant limitations in programmability and performance.\n  To overcome these issues, the thesis introduces Stateflow, a high-level object-oriented programming model that compiles applications into stateful dataflow graphs with minimal boilerplate. Building on this model, the thesis presents Styx, a distributed streaming dataflow engine that provides deterministic, multi-partition, serializable transactions with strong fault tolerance guarantees. Styx eliminates explicit transaction failure handling and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems.\n  Finally, the thesis extends Styx with transactional state migration to support elasticity under dynamic workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u53d1\u5927\u4f17\u5316\uff0c\u5148\u63a2\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u540e\u63d0\u51faStateflow\u6a21\u578b\u548cStyx\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u8fd8\u6269\u5c55Styx\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u9650\u5236\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5bb9\u9519\u53ef\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e8b\u52a1\u548c\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8bed\u4e49\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u5927\u4f17\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u901a\u8fc7T - Statefun\u63a2\u7d22\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u540e\u63d0\u51faStateflow\u7f16\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efaStyx\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6269\u5c55Styx\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "result": "Styx\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u4e8b\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5927\u4f17\u5316\u3002"}}

However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic cost of maintaining dense item-item similarity matrices. Partitioning-based paradigms have recently emerged as an effective strategy for balancing effectiveness and efficiency, enabling models to learn local similarities within coherent subgraphs while maintaining a limited global context. In this work, we focus on the Fine-tuning Partition-aware Similarity Refinement (FPSR) framework, a prominent representative of this family, as well as its extension, FPSR+. Reproducible evaluation of partition-aware collaborative filtering remains challenging, as prior FPSR/FPSR+ reports often rely on splits of unclear provenance and omit some similarity-based baselines, thereby complicating fair comparison. We present a transparent, fully reproducible benchmark of FPSR and FPSR+. Based on our results, the family of FPSR models does not consistently perform at the highest level. Overall, it remains competitive, validates its design choices, and shows significant advantages in long-tail scenarios. This highlights the accuracy-coverage trade-offs resulting from partitioning, global components, and hub design.

Data sourced from the World Development Indicators and Penn World Table were analyzed using static panel models, including Ordinary Least Squares, Fixed Effects, Random Effects, and Generalized Least Squares regressions. The empirical findings reveal that FDI exhibits a consistently positive but statistically insignificant correlation with economic growth across all model specifications. In contrast, domestic investment and human capital development emerge as significant and robust positive determinants of growth. Control variables such as government consumption and inflation show expected negative, though generally insignificant, associations with growth. The results imply that for the sampled South Asian economies, enhancing domestic investment and fostering human capital are more critical for driving economic expansion than relying on FDI inflows. Consequently, policymakers should prioritize strategies that strengthen local investment climates and improve educational and skill-building institutions to boost productivity. While FDI's role remains complementary, its insignificant immediate impact suggests the need for further research into the conditional factors such as institutional quality, financial market development, and trade policies that might mediate its effectiveness in fostering long-term growth within the region.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u75281980 - 2017\u5e74\u5357\u4e9a\u4e94\u56fd\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790FDI\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0FDI\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u56fd\u5185\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u66f4\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u653f\u7b56\u805a\u7126\u672c\u5730\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5916\u56fd\u76f4\u63a5\u6295\u8d44\uff08FDI\uff09\u5bf9\u5357\u4e9a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75281980 - 2017\u5e74\u4e94\u4e2a\u5357\u4e9a\u533a\u57df\u5408\u4f5c\u8054\u76df\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u7684\u5e74\u5ea6\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u666e\u901a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u968f\u673a\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u56de\u5f52\u7b49\u9759\u6001\u9762\u677f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "FDI\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u56fd\u5185\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u662f\u663e\u8457\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u589e\u957f\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u653f\u5e9c\u6d88\u8d39\u548c\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u7b49\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u589e\u957f\u591a\u4e3a\u9884\u671f\u7684\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u4e14\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5357\u4e9a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u5e94\u52a0\u5f3a\u56fd\u5185\u6295\u8d44\u5e76\u57f9\u517b\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\uff0cFDI\u6709\u8865\u5145\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u6548\u679c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5c06MAPPO\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5171\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMAPPO - LCR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9eMAPPO\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ea4\u4e92\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u8026\u5408\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MAPPO\u89e3\u51b3PPO\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u4e2a\u4f53\u6536\u76ca\u8026\u5408\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMAPPO - LCR\u7814\u7a76\u90bb\u57df\u5408\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0b\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u51fa\u73b0\u5408\u4f5c\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9eMAPPO\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "MAPPO\u548cMAPPO - LCR\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5171\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Adaptive variants update this subset in time, but multiscale systems with widely separated reaction rates remain challenging, as low-probability bottleneck states can carry essential probability flux and the dynamics alternate between fast transients and slowly evolving stiff regimes. We propose a flux-based adaptive FSP method that uses probability flux to drive both state-space pruning and time-step selection. The pruning rule protects low-probability states with large outgoing flux, preserving connectivity in bottleneck systems, while the time-step rule adapts to the instantaneous total flux to handle rate constants spanning several orders of magnitude. Numerical experiments on stiff, oscillatory, and bottleneck reaction networks show that the method maintains accuracy while using substantially smaller state spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u91cf\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94FSP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u5c0f\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94FSP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u72b6\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5feb\u6162\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u91cf\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94FSP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u6982\u7387\u901a\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fee\u526a\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u521a\u6027\u3001\u632f\u8361\u548c\u74f6\u9888\u53cd\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u5f97\u591a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u91cf\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94FSP\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u90e8\u7f72Text - to - SQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u63d0\u51faStruct - SQL\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72Text - to - SQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u5728\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6b67\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStruct - SQL\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5f0f\u84dd\u56fe\u6765\u83b7\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u4eff\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u53478.1%\uff0c\u53e5\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u84dd\u56fe\u6559\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u6210SQL\u6709\u76ca\u3002"}}

The algorithm has been revised for clarity, and feedback is welcome before final submission to a suitable journal", "summary": "The score set of a tournament is defined as the set of its distinct out-degrees. In 1978, Reid proposed the conjecture that for any set of nonnegative integers $D$, there exists a tournament $T$ with a degree set $D$. In 1989, Yao presented an arithmetical proof of the conjecture, but a general polynomial-time construction algorithm is not known. This paper proposes a necessary and sufficient condition and a separate necessary condition, based on the existing Landau's theorem for the problem of reconstructing score sequences from score sets of tournament graphs. The necessary condition introduces a structured set that enables the use of group-theoretic techniques, offering not only a framework for solving the reconstruction problem but also a new perspective for approaching similar problems. In particular, the same theoretical approach can be extended to reconstruct valid score sets given constraints on the frequency of distinct scores in tournaments. Based on these conditions, we have developed three algorithms that demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: a polynomial-time algorithm and a scalable algorithm for reconstructing score sequences, and a polynomial-time network-building method that finds all possible score sequences for a given score set. Moreover, the polynomial-time algorithm for reconstructing the score sequence of a tournament for a given score set can be used to verify Reid's conjecture. These algorithms have practical applications in sports analysis, ranking prediction, and machine learning tasks such as learning-to-rank models and data imputation, where the reconstruction of partial rankings or sequences is essential for recommendation systems and anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7ade\u8d5b\u56fe\u5f97\u5206\u96c6\u91cd\u6784\u5f97\u5206\u5e8f\u5217\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5fc5\u8981\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e09\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u731c\u60f3\u4e14\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "1978\u5e74Reid\u63d0\u51fa\u731c\u60f3\uff0c1989\u5e74Yao\u7ed9\u51fa\u7b97\u672f\u8bc1\u660e\u4f46\u7f3a\u5c11\u901a\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6784\u9020\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u7ade\u8d5b\u56fe\u5f97\u5206\u96c6\u91cd\u6784\u5f97\u5206\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b58\u7684Landau\u5b9a\u7406\u63d0\u51fa\u5fc5\u8981\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u96c6\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u7fa4\u8bba\u6280\u672f\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e09\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5fc5\u8981\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u91cd\u6784\u5f97\u5206\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u627e\u5230\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5f97\u5206\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1Reid\u731c\u60f3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6392\u540d\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

The recent release of Grokipedia, a fully AI-generated encyclopedia, introduces a new alternative to traditional, well-established platforms like Wikipedia. In this context, search engine mechanisms play an important role in guiding users exploratory paths, yet their behavior across different encyclopedic systems remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by providing the first comparative analysis of search engine in Wikipedia and Grokipedia.\n  Using nearly 10,000 neutral English words and their substrings as queries, we collect over 70,000 search engine results and examine their semantic alignment, overlap, and topical structure. We find that both platforms frequently generate results that are weakly related to the original query and, in many cases, surface unexpected content starting from innocuous queries. Despite these shared properties, the two systems often produce substantially different recommendation sets for the same query. Through topical annotation and trajectory analysis, we further identify systematic differences in how content categories are surfaced and how search engine results evolve over multiple stages of exploration.\n  Overall, our findings show that unexpected search engine outcomes are a common feature of both the platforms, even though they exhibit discrepancies in terms of topical distribution and query suggestions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9Wikipedia\u548cGrokipedia\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u5e73\u53f0\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u5e38\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u6709\u610f\u5916\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u96c6\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u540c\u767e\u79d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9Wikipedia\u548cGrokipedia\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u8fd110000\u4e2a\u4e2d\u6027\u82f1\u6587\u5355\u8bcd\u53ca\u5176\u5b50\u4e32\u4f5c\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u8d8570000\u6761\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u9898\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u5e73\u53f0\u7ed3\u679c\u5e38\u4e0e\u539f\u67e5\u8be2\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u6709\u610f\u5916\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u76f8\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u4e24\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u96c6\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u5185\u5bb9\u7c7b\u522b\u5448\u73b0\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6f14\u53d8\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u610f\u5916\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u4e24\u5e73\u53f0\u5e38\u89c1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e24\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u5efa\u8bae\u4e0a\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength. This system demonstrates a feasible pathway to low-cost, biologically intuitive prosthetic control suitable for underserved and global health applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408EEG\u548cEMG\u5b9e\u73b0\u5047\u80a2\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u529f\u80fd\u539f\u578b\u5e76\u89c4\u5212\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u80a2\u5047\u80a2\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u89c2\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7528NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2\u91c7\u96c6EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f20\u81f3ESP32\u8fd0\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7528MyoWare 2.0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548cSparkFun\u65e0\u7ebf\u76fe\u724c\u91c7\u96c6EMG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f20\u81f3\u53e6\u4e00ESP32\u8fdb\u884c\u9608\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u603b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6240\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u539f\u578b\uff0cEEG\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6307\uff0cEMG\u63a7\u5236\u8098\u90e8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u751f\u7269\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u670d\u52a1\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5168\u7403\u5065\u5eb7\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios.

Yet we lack systematic evidence on how segregation varies across Europe, and what structural factors are associated with these patterns. This study addresses the gap by focusing on two questions: (i) how does immigrant-native segregation vary across urban areas in Europe, and (ii) which urban area- and country-level characteristics are consistently linked to segregation? Using harmonised 1x1 km grid-level data from the 2021/22 census, we calculate spatially weighted Dissimilarity Indices for all 717 Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) across 30 European countries. We combine these measures with rich data on demographics, the economy, housing, immigrant populations, and policy. To identify robust correlates of segregation, we apply a Specification Curve Analysis across 16,164 regression models. Segregation is higher in Western and Northern Europe compared to most of Eastern and Southern Europe. Moreover, we show that segregation is heavily driven by macro-spatial dynamics between diverse urban cores and relatively homogeneous suburban areas. At the urban area level, segregation is systematically linked to the demographic composition and spatial distribution of the local population, economic conditions, housing market characteristics, as well as the composition of the immigrant population. At the national level, established immigrant destinations are more segregated, while migration and integration policies are not consistently linked to segregation. These findings offer the most comprehensive comparative assessment of immigrant segregation across Europe to date, revealing how structural conditions relate to spatial integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u666e\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u7814\u7a76\u6b27\u6d32\u57ce\u5e02\u79fb\u6c11\u9694\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u897f\u6b27\u548c\u5317\u6b27\u9694\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b27\u6d32\u79fb\u6c11\u9694\u79bb\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282021/22\u5e74\u666e\u67e5\u76841x1\u516c\u91cc\u7f51\u683c\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u7b97717\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u57ce\u5e02\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9694\u79bb\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u89c4\u8303\u66f2\u7ebf\u5206\u679016164\u4e2a\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u897f\u6b27\u548c\u5317\u6b27\u9694\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e1c\u6b27\u548c\u5357\u6b27\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u53d7\u57ce\u5e02\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0e\u90ca\u533a\u5b8f\u89c2\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u5c42\u9762\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6b27\u6d32\u79fb\u6c11\u9694\u79bb\u6700\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

By unifying their respective evidence lower bounds, SAMI formulates a principled objective that learns representations through score-based guidance of the underlying diffusion process. The resulting representations automatically capture meaningful structure in the data: it recovers ground truth generative factors in our synthetic dataset, learns factorized, semantic latent dimensions from complex natural images, and encodes video sequences into latent trajectories that are straighter than those of alternative encoders, despite training exclusively on static images. Furthermore, SAMI can extract useful representations from pre-trained diffusion models with minimal additional training. Finally, the explicitly probabilistic formulation provides new ways to identify semantically meaningful axes in the absence of supervised labels, and its mathematical exactness allows us to make formal statements about the nature of the learned representation.

The continuum nature of the $\u03c6^4$ theory avoids the inaccuracies that occur in Ising-based models which require a discretization of the time series. We demonstrate this using the example of the 2008 global financial crisis. The $\u03c6^{4}$ quantum field theory is expressive enough to reproduce the higher-order statistics such as the market kurtosis, which can serve as an indicator of possible market shocks. Accurate reproduction of high kurtosis is absent in binarized models. Therefore Ising models, despite being widely employed in econophysics, are incapable of fully representing empirical financial data, a limitation not present in the generalization of the $\u03c6^{4}$ scalar field theory. We then investigate the scaling properties of the $\u03c6^{4}$ machine learning algorithm and extract exponents which govern the behavior of the learned couplings (or weights and biases in ML language) in relation to the number of stocks in the model. Finally, we use our model to forecast the price changes of the AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA stocks.

This study presents and validates an anticipatory, parametric framework that converts landscape vulnerability and precipitation into transparent, zone-aware threat levels at neighborhood scales. We first derive an inherent hazard likelihood (IHL) surface using pluvial flood depth, height above nearest drainage, and distance to streams. Next, we compute a hazard severity index (HSI) by normalizing 24-hour rainfall against local Atlas-14 100-year, 24-hour depths. We then integrate IHL and HSI within a localized threat severity (LTS) matrix using 20 class-specific triggers, requiring lower exceedance in high-risk terrain and higher exceedance in uplands. Applied to two Texas flood events, the LTS exhibits statistically significant spatial association with independent crowdsourced impact proxies, capturing observed disruption hotspots.

However, existing research focuses primarily on kernel-level optimizations, lacking a holistic serving framework that addresses the unique memory dynamics of diffusion processes in production. We identify a critical \"memory footprint crisis\" specific to dLLMs, driven by monolithic logit tensors and the severe resource oscillation between compute-bound \"Refresh\" phases and bandwidth-bound \"Reuse\" phases. To bridge this gap, we present dLLM-Serve, an efficient dLLM serving system that co-optimizes memory footprint, computational scheduling, and generation quality. dLLM-Serve introduces Logit-Aware Activation Budgeting to decompose transient tensor peaks, a Phase-Multiplexed Scheduler to interleave heterogeneous request phases, and Head-Centric Sparse Attention to decouple logical sparsity from physical storage. We evaluate dLLM-Serve on diverse workloads (LiveBench, Burst, OSC) and GPUs (RTX 4090, L40S).

These workflows generate rapidly expanding contexts that must be curated, transformed, and compressed to maintain fidelity, avoid attention dilution, and reduce inference cost. Prior work on summarization and query-aware compression largely ignores the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency.

By further linking the SMS to sub-sequent systems and services like PID-registration or controlled vocabularies and establishing a community of end-users, the SMS provides the central element of a digital ecosystem, that fosters a more consistent, sustainable and FAIR provision of sensor-related metadata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08SMS\uff09\u4ee5\u7ba1\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548cFAIR\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u73af\u5883\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5f97\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u7ed3\u8bba\u548c\u6df1\u5165\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6765\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u9700\u7ba1\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1SMS\uff0c\u7528\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u672f\u8bed\u63cf\u8ff0\u5404\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u540e\u7eed\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u793e\u533a\u3002", "result": "SMS\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5143\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "SMS\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548cFAIR\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u5143\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002"}}

At each step, all neighbors of burning vertices catch fire. A well-studied extension to model fire containment is to allow for fireproofing a number $B$ of non-burning vertices at each step. Interestingly, basic computational questions about this model are computationally hard even on trees. One of the most prominent such examples is Resource Minimization for Fire Containment (RMFC), which asks how small $B$ can be chosen so that a given subset of vertices will never catch fire. Despite recent progress on RMFC on trees, prior work left a significant gap in terms of its approximability. We close this gap by providing an optimal $2$-approximation and an asymptotic PTAS, resolving two open questions in the literature. Both results are obtained in a unified way, by first designing a PTAS for a smooth variant of RMFC, which is obtained through a careful LP-guided enumeration procedure.\n  Moreover, we show that our new techniques, with several additional ingredients, carry over to the non-uniform $k$-center problem (NUkC), by exploiting a link between RMFC on trees and NUkC established by Chakrabarty, Goyal, and Krishnaswamy. This leads to the first approximation algorithm for NUkC that is optimal in terms of the number of additional centers that have to be opened.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u706b\u707e\u63a7\u5236\u8d44\u6e90\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff08RMFC\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f182 - \u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1PTAS\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c06\u6280\u672f\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u5747\u5300k - \u4e2d\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff08NUkC\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8eRMFC\u5728\u6811\u4e0a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u4e3aRMFC\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1PTAS\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684LP\u5f15\u5bfc\u679a\u4e3e\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1b\u5229\u7528RMFC\u548cNUkC\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u5c06\u6280\u672f\u62d3\u5c55\u5230NUkC\u3002", "result": "\u4e3aRMFC\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f182 - \u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1PTAS\uff1b\u5f97\u5230NUkC\u5728\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u8bbe\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RMFC\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6280\u672f\u6210\u529f\u62d3\u5c55\u5230NUkC\u3002"}}

However, such separate application may lead to semantic misalignment between the expanded queries (or documents) and their relevant documents (or queries). To address this serious issue, we propose TCDE, a dual expansion strategy that leverages large language models (LLMs) for topic-centric enrichment on both queries and documents. In TCDE, we design two distinct prompt templates for processing each query and document. On the query side, an LLM is guided to identify distinct sub-topics within each query and generate a focused pseudo-document for each sub-topic. On the document side, an LLM is guided to distill each document into a set of core topic sentences. The resulting outputs are used to expand the original query and document. This topic-centric dual expansion process establishes semantic bridges between queries and their relevant documents, enabling better alignment for downstream retrieval models. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, TREC Deep Learning and BEIR, demonstrate that TCDE achieves substantial improvements over strong state-of-the-art expansion baselines. In particular, on dense retrieval tasks, it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, with a relative improvement of 2.8\\% in NDCG@10 on the SciFact dataset.

Among the prominent approaches, the Kernel Trick, widely used in support vector machines, provides efficient similarity computation, while the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM), originating from quantum state discrimination, enables classification grounded in Hilbert space geometry. Building on recent developments in kernelized PGM (KPGM) and direct PGM-based classifiers, this work presents a unified theoretical and empirical comparison of these paradigms. We analyze their performance across synthetic oversampling scenarios using Quantum SMOTE (QSMOTE) variants. Experimental results show that both PGM and KPGM classifiers consistently outperform a classical random forest baseline, particularly when multiple quantum copies are employed. Notably, PGM with stereo encoding and n_copies=2 achieves the highest overall accuracy (0.8512) and F1-score (0.8234), while KPGM demonstrates competitive and more stable behavior across QSMOTE variants, with top scores of 0.8511 (stereo) and 0.8483 (amplitude). These findings highlight that quantum-inspired classifiers not only provide tangible gains in recall and balanced performance but also offer complementary strengths: PGM benefits from encoding-specific enhancements, whereas KPGM ensures robustness across sampling strategies.

Classical optimal procedures often rely on strong structural assumptions, which can be misspecified in practice and complicate deployment. This limitation has sparked growing interest in structure-agnostic approaches -- methods that debias black-box nuisance estimates without imposing structural priors. Understanding the fundamental limits of these methods is therefore crucial. This paper provides a systematic investigation of the optimal error rates achievable by structure-agnostic estimators. We first show that, for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE), a central parameter in causal inference, doubly robust learning attains optimal structure-agnostic error rates. We then extend our analysis to a general class of functionals that depend on unknown nuisance functions and establish the structure-agnostic optimality of debiased/double machine learning (DML). We distinguish two regimes -- one where double robustness is attainable and one where it is not -- leading to different optimal rates for first-order debiasing, and show that DML is optimal in both regimes. Finally, we instantiate our general lower bounds by deriving explicit optimal rates that recover existing results and extend to additional estimands of interest. Our results provide theoretical validation for widely used first-order debiasing methods and guidance for practitioners seeking optimal approaches in the absence of structural assumptions.

The method is based on choosing a new state on a slice, i.e., a superlevel set of the given unnormalized target density (with respect to a reference measure). However, slice sampling algorithms usually require per step multiple evaluations of the target density, and thus can become computationally expensive. This is particularly the case for Bayesian inference with costly likelihoods. In this paper, we exploit deterministic approximations of the target density, which are relatively cheap to evaluate, and propose delayed acceptance versions of hybrid slice samplers.

In computational settings, most protein language models (PLMs) are not trained to favor high-affinity antibodies, and existing preference optimization approaches introduce substantial computational overhead without clear affinity gains. Therefore, this work proposes SimBinder-IF, which converts the inverse folding model ESM-IF into an antibody sequence generator by freezing its structure encoder and training only its decoder to prefer experimentally stronger binders through preference optimization.\n  Results: On the 11-assay AbBiBench benchmark, SimBinder-IF achieves a 55 percent relative improvement in mean Spearman correlation between log-likelihood scores and experimentally measured binding affinity compared to vanilla ESM-IF (from 0.264 to 0.410). In zero-shot generalization across four unseen antigen-antibody complexes, the correlation improves by 156 percent (from 0.115 to 0.294). SimBinder-IF also outperforms baselines in top-10 precision for ten-fold or greater affinity improvements. A case study redesigning antibody F045-092 for A/California/04/2009 (pdmH1N1) shows that SimBinder-IF proposes variants with substantially lower predicted binding free energy changes than ESM-IF (mean Delta Delta G -75.16 vs -46.57).

The goal is to design an adaptive query strategy that minimizes the query cost incurred in computing an optimal solution. Solving such problems generally requires that we be able to solve the associated verification problem: given the answers to all queries in advance, find a minimum-cost set of queries that certifies an optimal solution to the combinatorial optimization problem. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for verifying a minimum-weight basis of a matroid, where each weight lies in a given uncertainty area. These areas may be finite sets, real intervals, or unions of open and closed intervals, strictly generalizing previous work by Erlebach and Hoffman which only handled the special case of open intervals. Our algorithm introduces new techniques to address the resulting challenges.\n  Verification problems are of particular importance in the area of explorable uncertainty, as the structural insights and techniques used to solve the verification problem often heavily influence work on the corresponding online problem and its stochastic variant. In our case, we use structural results from the verification problem to give a best-possible algorithm for a promise variant of the corresponding adaptive online problem.

In this paper, we study the problem of improving RecSys model predictions for cold-start (CS) items, which appear infrequently in the training data. Although this problem is well-studied in academia, few studies have addressed its root causes effectively at the scale of a platform like Pinterest. By investigating live traffic data, we identified several challenges of the CS problem and developed a corresponding solution for each: First, industrial-scale RecSys models must operate under tight computational constraints. Since CS items are a minority, any related improvements must be highly cost-efficient. To address this, our solutions were designed to be lightweight, collectively increasing the total parameters by only 5%. Second, CS items are represented only by non-historical (e.g., content or attribute) features, which models often treat as less important. To elevate their significance, we introduce a residual connection for the non-historical features. Third, CS items tend to receive lower prediction scores compared to non-CS items, reducing their likelihood of being surfaced. We mitigate this by incorporating a score regularization term into the model. Fourth, the labels associated with CS items are sparse, making it difficult for the model to learn from them. We apply the manifold mixup technique to address this data sparsity. Implemented together, our methods increased fresh content engagement at Pinterest by 10% without negatively impacting overall engagement and cost, and have been deployed to serve over 570 million users on Pinterest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76Pinterest\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7269\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9879\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5185\u5bb9\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u63d0\u534710%\u4e14\u65e0\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5df2\u670d\u52a1\u8d855.7\u4ebf\u7528\u6237\u3002", "motivation": "Pinterest\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7269\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u867d\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728Pinterest\u5e73\u53f0\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u672a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6839\u6e90\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u4ec5\u589e5%\uff09\uff1b\u4e3a\u975e\u5386\u53f2\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u5165\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff1b\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u5206\u6570\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u6d41\u5f62\u6df7\u5408\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5171\u540c\u5b9e\u65bd\u540e\uff0cPinterest\u65b0\u9c9c\u5185\u5bb9\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u63d0\u534710%\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u670d\u52a1\u8d855.7\u4ebf\u7528\u6237\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7269\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e73\u53f0\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This not only increases system complexity but also often lacks interpretability when handling mixed-domain inputs.\n  Building upon the premise that ``Compression is Intelligence,'' this paper proposes a novel architectural philosophy: \\textbf{``Compression is Routing.''} We trained an 87M-parameter end-to-end Transformer Autoencoder, achieving a \\textbf{64x sequence length compression} (compressing 512 tokens into 8 latent vectors). Experimental results demonstrate that this compressor possesses extreme domain discriminative capability: it achieves a reconstruction accuracy of \\textbf{99.47\\%} on the in-domain (code) validation set; accuracy drops sharply to \\textbf{47.76\\%} on a semi-out-of-distribution domain (Wiki text); and further plummets to just \\textbf{0.57\\%} on a fully out-of-distribution domain (random sequences).\n  This extreme and systematic performance discrepancy establishes the validity of reconstruction error as an \\textbf{Intrinsic Distribution Fingerprint}. Based on this, we propose that expert modules can be automatically scheduled using reconstruction residuals directly, without the need for explicit gating networks. This mechanism offers excellent scalability. Furthermore, this architecture provides a new perspective on ``VRAM compression'' for handling ultra-long contexts. This report aims to verify the physical validity of this foundational architecture, offering a new research perspective for the next generation of scalable modular neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u538b\u7f29\u5373\u8def\u7531\u201d\u67b6\u6784\u54f2\u5b66\uff0c\u7528\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u538b\u7f29\u5373\u8def\u7531\u201d\u54f2\u5b66\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec387M\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefTransformer\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b064\u500d\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u6709\u6781\u5f3a\u9886\u57df\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u6307\u7eb9\uff0c\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u6b8b\u5dee\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

My identification strategy combines the quasi-exogenous allocation of refugees to Austrian regions with high seasonality in Austria's hospitality sector, where 25% of refugees find initial employment. Exploiting within region, within year variation, I find that receiving labor market access during high seasonal demand increases employment probability initially, with significant employment effects of up to 3 percentage points, or 9% of the mean, in the first months. Employment advantages diminish after the first year, indicating that such early employment opportunities do not serve as a stepping stone. Still, treated refugees have in total earned more in the first three years, with no significant differences in medium-term wages and job quality. One disadvantage of early employment in hospitality is the increased labor market segregation, as treated refugees are more likely to work in industries more typical for refugees and in firms with higher non-Austrian coworker shares.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5965\u5730\u5229\u9152\u5e97\u4e1a\u65e9\u671f\u4f4e\u95e8\u69db\u5c31\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a\u5bf9\u96be\u6c11\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u878d\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u521d\u671f\u6709\u5c31\u4e1a\u4fc3\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u57ab\u811a\u77f3\uff0c\u6709\u6536\u5165\u589e\u52a0\u4f46\u4e5f\u6709\u52b3\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u9694\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9152\u5e97\u4e1a\u65e9\u671f\u4e34\u65f6\u4f4e\u95e8\u69db\u5c31\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a\u5bf9\u96be\u6c11\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u878d\u5165\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u96be\u6c11\u51c6\u5916\u751f\u5206\u914d\u5230\u5965\u5730\u5229\u9152\u5e97\u4e1a\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u9ad8\u7684\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5730\u533a\u5185\u548c\u5e74\u5ea6\u5185\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u65fa\u5b63\u83b7\u5f97\u5c31\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a\u4f7f\u521d\u671f\u5c31\u4e1a\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\u8fbe3\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u4e00\u5e74\u540e\u5c31\u4e1a\u4f18\u52bf\u51cf\u5f31\uff1b\u524d\u4e09\u5e74\u603b\u6536\u5165\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e2d\u671f\u5de5\u8d44\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u9694\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9152\u5e97\u4e1a\u65e9\u671f\u5c31\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0d\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u96be\u6c11\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u878d\u5165\u7684\u57ab\u811a\u77f3\uff0c\u4e14\u5e26\u6765\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u9694\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

But these systems struggle to adapt to patients' complex and ever-changing behaviour, and to operate within mobile settings, such as heat and power. To aid this, we present NeuRehab: an end-to-end framework consisting of a training and inference pipeline with AI-based automation, co-designed with neuromorphic computing-based control systems that balance action performance, power consumption, and observed latency. The framework consists of 2 partitions. One is designated for the rehabilitation device based on ultra-low power spiking networks deployed on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. The other resides on stationary hardware that can accommodate computationally intensive hardware for fine-tuning on a per-patient basis. By maintaining a communication channel between both the modules and splitting the algorithm components, the power and latency requirements of the movable system have been optimised, while retaining the learning performance advantages of compute- and power-hungry hardware on the stationary machine. As part of the framework, we propose (a) the split machine learning processes for efficiency in architectural utilisation, and (b) task-specific temporal optimisations to lower edge-inference control latency. This paper evaluates the proposed methods on a reference stepper motor-based shoulder exercise.

However, real-world queries are often relational, seeking to understand how entities are associated. In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684KGQA\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u63d0\u51faUniRel - R1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfKGQA\u5173\u6ce8\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u67e5\u8be2\u591a\u4e3a\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684KGQA\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniRel - R1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5b50\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u56fe\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "UniRel - R1\u5728\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "UniRel - R1\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3KGQA\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, little is known about how developers actually use TEEs in practice. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of real-world TEE applications. We collected and analyzed 241 open-source projects from GitHub that utilize the two most widely-adopted TEEs, Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone. By combining manual inspection with customized static analysis scripts, we examined their adoption contexts, usage patterns, and development practices across three phases. First, we categorized the projects into 8 application domains and identified trends in TEE adoption over time. We found that the dominant use case is IoT device security (30%), which contrasts sharply with prior academic focus on blockchain and cryptographic systems (7%), while AI model protection (12%) is rapidly emerging as a growing domain. Second, we analyzed how TEEs are integrated into software and observed that 32.4% of the projects reimplement cryptographic functionalities instead of using official SDK APIs, suggesting that current SDKs may have limited usability and portability to meet developers' practical needs. Third, we examined security practices through manual inspection and found that 25.3% (61 of 241) of the projects exhibit insecure coding behaviors when using TEEs, such as hardcoded secrets and missing input validation, which undermine their intended security guarantees. Our findings have important implications for improving the usability of TEE SDKs and supporting developers in trusted software development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2dTEE\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790241\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347SDK\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u8f6f\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528TEE\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4eceGitHub\u6536\u96c6241\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528Intel SGX\u548cARM TrustZone\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u811a\u672c\u5206\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u9879\u76ee\u4e3b\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eIoT\u8bbe\u5907\u5b89\u5168\uff1b32.4%\u9879\u76ee\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u5bc6\u529f\u80fd\uff1b25.3%\u9879\u76ee\u6709\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7f16\u7801\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347TEE SDK\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u4fe1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, the research community lacks a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the LLMs over their limitations and boundaries in RecSys so that we can draw a confident conclusion. To investigate this, we propose a benchmark named LRWorld containing over 38K high-quality samples and 23M tokens carefully compiled and generated from widely used public recommendation datasets. LRWorld categorizes the mental world of LLMs in RecSys as three main scales (association, personalization, and knowledgeability) spanned by ten factors with 31 measures (tasks). Based on LRWorld, comprehensive experiments on dozens of LLMs show that they are still not well capturing the deep neural personalized embeddings but can achieve good results on shallow memory-based item-item similarity. They are also good at perceiving item entity relations, entity hierarchical taxonomies, and item-item association rules when inferring user interests. Furthermore, LLMs show a promising ability in multimodal knowledge reasoning (movie poster and product image) and robustness to noisy profiles.

Current operational approaches rely on computationally intensive numerical weather prediction guidance and human-issued TAF products, which often exhibit conservative biases and limited temporal resolution. This study presents a lightweight gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) trained exclusively on surface observation data (METAR) and enhanced through physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles. The framework is evaluated across 11 international airports representing distinct climatic regimes (including SCEL, KJFK, KORD, KDEN, SBGR, and VIDP) using historical data from 2000 to 2024. Results suggest that the model successfully captures underlying local physical processes without manual configuration. In a blind comparative evaluation against operational TAF forecasts, the automated model achieved substantially higher detection rates at tactical horizons (3 hours), with a 2.5 to 4.0 times improvement in recall while reducing false alarms. Furthermore, SHAP analysis reveals that the model performs an implicit reconstruction of local physical drivers (advection, radiation, and subsidence), providing actionable explainability for operational situational awareness.\n  Keywords: aviation meteorology; physics-guided machine learning; explainable artificial intelligence; lightweight machine learning; nowcasting; METAR; TAF verification; edge computing", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u9762\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6846\u67b6XGBoost\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u548c\u964d\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u673a\u573a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u548c\u964d\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u62a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u6709\u4fdd\u5b88\u504f\u5dee\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6846\u67b6XGBoost\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u9762\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff08METAR\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u572811\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6c14\u5019\u533a\u57df\u673a\u573a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u5f53\u5730\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u672a\u624b\u52a8\u914d\u7f6e\uff1b\u4e0eTAF\u9884\u62a5\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c3\u5c0f\u65f6\u6218\u672f\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u63d0\u53472.5 - 4.0\u500d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\uff1bSHAP\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u9690\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u5f53\u5730\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5XGBoost\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u548c\u964d\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Two-way Contracts for Difference (CfDs) can mitigate these risks. They stipulate payments between the government and generators of renewable electricity based on the difference of a strike and a reference price, whose definition and unit of payment differ between CfD designs. We study the effect of three different CfD designs on wind power profit and consumer price volatility under the consideration of uncertain market outcomes in a highly renewable, sector-coupled electricity market. First, we analytically derive optimal strike prices under uncertainty. Second, we numerically determine optimal strike prices based on market expectations retrieved from optimising a set of 36 market scenarios in an energy system model. Third, we study the distribution of ex post market revenues, CfD payments and consumer prices across all 36 scenarios. Compared to purely market-based consumer prices and investor profits, we find all CfDs to significantly reduce volatility. For consumer prices, results show no substantial differences between CfD designs. For investor profits, we identify the highest volatility reduction under a capacity-based CfD with a reference price similar to power plants' individual market revenues.

Starting from the 1RSB formulation of belief propagation, we derive explicit update rules of 1RSB-AMP together with the corresponding state evolution (1RSB-SE) equations. A detailed comparison shows that 1RSB-AMP and 1RSB-SE agree remarkably well at the macroscopic level, even in parameter regions where replica-symmetric (RS) AMP, termed RS-AMP, diverges and where the 1RSB description itself is not expected to be thermodynamically exact. Fixed-point analysis of 1RSB-SE reveals a phase diagram consisting of success, failure, and diverging phases, as in the RS case. However, the diverging-region boundary now depends on the Parisi parameter due to the 1RSB ansatz, and we propose a new criterion -- minimizing the size of the diverging region -- rather than the conventional zero-complexity condition, to determine its value. Combining this criterion with the nonconvexity-control (NCC) protocol proposed in a previous RS study improves the algorithmic limit of perfect reconstruction compared with RS-AMP. Numerical solutions of 1RSB-SE and experiments with 1RSB-AMP confirm that this improved limit is achieved in practice, though the gain is modest and remains slightly inferior to the Bayes-optimal threshold.

While these stages enhance capability, they introduce significant system bottlenecks. First, multimodal preprocessing-especially video decoding-often dominates Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). Most systems rely on CPU-based decoding, which severely limits throughput, while existing GPU-based approaches prioritize throughput-oriented parallelism and fail to meet the latency-sensitive requirements of MLLM inference. Second, the vision encoder is a standalone, compute-intensive stage that produces visual embeddings and cannot be co-batched with LLM prefill or decoding. This heterogeneity forces inter-stage blocking and increases token-generation latency. Even when deployed on separate GPUs, these stages underutilize available compute and memory resources, reducing overall utilization and constraining system throughput.\n  To address these challenges, we present FlashCodec and UnifiedServe, two complementary designs that jointly optimize the end-to-end MLLM pipeline. FlashCodec accelerates the multimodal preprocessing stage through collaborative multi-GPU video decoding, reducing decoding latency while preserving high throughput. UnifiedServe optimizes the vision-to-text and inference stages using a logically decoupled their execution to eliminate inter-stage blocking, yet physically sharing GPU resources to maximize GPU system utilization.

Progress is limited by weak causal control, ethical constraints, and scarce temporal data. We address these barriers using simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently varying realistic and symbolic threat while tracking actions, language, and attitudes. Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u865a\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u8c61\u5f81\u5a01\u80c1\u5982\u4f55\u5f15\u53d1\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u7269\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u8c61\u5f81\u4ef7\u503c\u5a01\u80c1\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u4f55\u8005\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\uff0c\u53d7\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u5f31\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u9650\u5236\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u865a\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u6539\u53d8\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u8c61\u5f81\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6001\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u3001\u8c61\u5f81\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u654c\u610f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u76f4\u63a5\u589e\u52a0\u654c\u610f\uff0c\u8c61\u5f81\u5a01\u80c1\u4f5c\u7528\u8f83\u5f31\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u65e0\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u654c\u610f\uff1b\u975e\u654c\u5bf9\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u63a5\u89e6\u53ef\u7f13\u51b2\u51b2\u7a81\u5347\u7ea7\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f7f\u591a\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u654c\u610f\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u9a71\u52a8\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, the computational complexity of four important problem variants has remained unresolved and was explicitly identified as an open question in prior work. In this paper, we settle the complexity of these variants.\n  More specifically, we prove that the problem of minimizing the objective of total (weighted) flow time plus energy is NP-hard for the cases of (i) unit-weight jobs with arbitrary sizes, and (ii)~arbitrary-weight jobs with unit sizes. These results extend to the objective of minimizing the total (weighted) flow time subject to an energy budget and hold even when the schedule is required to adhere to a given priority ordering.\n  In contrast, we show that when a completion-time ordering is provided, the same problem variants become polynomial-time solvable.

To overcome this, BSARec augments the Transformer encoder with a frequency layer that rescales high-frequency components using the Fourier transform. However, the overall effectiveness of BSARec and the roles of its individual components have yet to be systematically validated. We reproduce BSARec and show that it outperforms other SR methods on some datasets. To empirically assess whether BSARec improves performance on high-frequency signals, we propose a metric to quantify user history frequency and evaluate SR methods across different user groups. We compare digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and find that the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) offer only slight improvements over Fourier transforms, and DSP methods provide no clear advantage over simple residual connections.

This exposes distinct functional clusters that are otherwise sparsely connected. We find that while governments and multilateral agencies provide the primary resources, a small set of knowledge brokers provide the critical connectivity. Universities and research foundations specifically act as essential bridges between disparate islands of implementers and funders. We identify a core solar system of 25 central actors who drive this connectivity including unanticipated brokers like J-PAL and the Hewlett Foundation. These findings demonstrate that influence in the aid ecosystem flows through structural connectivity as much as financial volume. Our results provide a new framework for donors to identify strategic partners that accelerate coordination and evidence diffusion across the global network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed8\u5236\u5168\u7403\u63f4\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u85cf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5173\u952e\u8fde\u63a5\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u6350\u8d60\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u63f4\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u603b\u4f53\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d851000\u4e07\u4ea4\u6613\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8c\u5206\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u653f\u5e9c\u548c\u591a\u8fb9\u673a\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e3b\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e2d\u4ecb\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a25\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u884c\u52a8\u8005\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u8d44\u91d1\u91cf\u6709\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6350\u8d60\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u6218\u7565\u4f19\u4f34\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5168\u7403\u7f51\u7edc\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u4f20\u64ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While statistically optimal estimators exist for general heavy-tailed distributions, they often rely on computationally expensive techniques like semidefinite programming or iterative M-estimation ($O(d^3)$). In this work, we target the specific regime of \\textbf{Sub-Weibull distributions} (characterized by stretched exponential tails $\\exp(-t^\u03b1)$). We investigate a computationally efficient alternative: the \\textbf{Cross-Fitted Norm-Truncated Estimator}. Unlike element-wise truncation, our approach preserves the spectral geometry while requiring $O(Nd^2)$ operations, which represents the theoretical lower bound for constructing a full covariance matrix. Although spherical truncation is geometrically suboptimal for anisotropic data, we prove that within the Sub-Weibull class, the exponential tail decay compensates for this mismatch. Leveraging weighted Hanson-Wright inequalities, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds showing that our estimator recovers the optimal sub-Gaussian rate $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{r(\u03a3)/N})$ with high probability.

Using transaction level data from November 2024 to February 2025, enriched with mempool visibility and ZeroMEV labels, we track user outcomes after their n-th public sandwich: (i) reactivation, i.e., the resumption of on-chain activity within a 60-day window, and (ii) first-time adoption of private routing. We refer to users who do not reactivate within this window as churned, and to users experiencing multiple attacks (n>1) as undergoing repeated exposure. Our analysis reveals measurable behavioral adaptation: around 40% of victims migrate to private routing within 60 days, rising to 54% with repeated exposures. Churn peaks at 7.5% after the first sandwich but declines to 1-2%, consistent with survivor bias. In Nov-Dec 2024 we confirm 2,932 private sandwich attacks affecting 3,126 private victim transactions, producing \\$409,236 in losses and \\$293,786 in attacker profits. A single bot accounts for nearly two-thirds of private frontruns, and private sandwich activity is heavily concentrated on a small set of DEX pools.

Despite its maturity and widespread adoption, consolidated research on reusable architectural design patterns and reproducible benchmarking methodologies remains fragmented across academic and industrial publications. This paper presents a structured synthesis of forty two peer reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025, identifying nine recurring Kafka design patterns including log compaction, CQRS bus, exactly once pipelines, change data capture, stream table joins, saga orchestration, tiered storage, multi tenant topics, and event sourcing replay. The analysis examines co usage trends, domain specific deployments, and empirical benchmarking practices using standard suites such as TPCx Kafka and the Yahoo Streaming Benchmark, as well as custom workloads. The study highlights significant inconsistencies in configuration disclosure, evaluation rigor, and reproducibility that limit cross study comparison and practical replication.

Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level.

In C-PVC, we are given a hypergraph with capacities on its vertices and a partition of the hyperedge set into $\u03c9$ distinct groups. The objective is to select a minimum size subset of vertices that satisfies two main conditions: (1) in each group, the total number of covered hyperedges meets a specified threshold, and (2) the number of hyperedges assigned to any vertex respects its capacity constraint. A covered hyperedge is required to be assigned to a selected vertex that belongs to the hyperedge. This formulation generalizes classical Vertex Cover, Partial Vertex Cover, and Partition Vertex Cover.\n  We investigate two primary variants: soft capacitated (multiple copies of a vertex are allowed) and hard capacitated (each vertex can be chosen at most once). Let $f$ denote the rank of the hypergraph. Our main contributions are: $(i)$ an $(f+1)$-approximation algorithm for the weighted soft-capacitated C-PVC problem, which runs in $n^{O(\u03c9)}$ time, and $(ii)$ an $(f+\u03b5)$-approximation algorithm for the unweighted hard-capacitated C-PVC problem, which runs in $n^{O(\u03c9/\u03b5)}$ time.\n  We also study a natural generalization of the edge cover problem, the \\emph{Weighted Partition Edge Cover} (W-PEC) problem, where each edge has an associated weight, and the vertex set is partitioned into groups. For each group, the goal is to cover at least a specified number of vertices using incident edges, while minimizing the total weight of the selected edges. We present the first exact polynomial-time algorithm for the weighted case, improving runtime from $O(\u03c9n^3)$ to $O(mn+n^2 \\log n)$ and simplifying the algorithmic structure over prior unweighted approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Through a two month-long randomised controlled trial, we compare an agentic messaging approach against a business-as-usual (BAU) rule-based campaign system, focusing on two primary outcomes: unsubscribe behaviour and conversion timing. Empirical results show that agent-led messaging reduced unsubscribe events by 21\\% ($\\pm 0.01$) relative to BAU and increased early filing behaviour in the weeks preceding the national deadline.

The enormous size of chemical space and the cost of high-fidelity simulations have driven the development of machine learning-guided strategies for accelerating design with limited data. Among these, Bayesian optimization (BO) offers a principled framework for sample-efficient search, while generative models provide a mechanism to propose novel, diverse candidates beyond fixed libraries. However, existing methods that couple the two often rely on continuous latent spaces, which introduces both architectural entanglement and scalability challenges. This work introduces an alternative, modular \"generate-then-optimize\" framework for de novo multi-objective molecular design/discovery. At each iteration, a generative model is used to construct a large, diverse pool of candidate molecules, after which a novel acquisition function, qPMHI (multi-point Probability of Maximum Hypervolume Improvement), is used to optimally select a batch of candidates most likely to induce the largest Pareto front expansion. The key insight is that qPMHI decomposes additively, enabling exact, scalable batch selection via only simple ranking of probabilities that can be easily estimated with Monte Carlo sampling. We benchmark the framework against state-of-the-art latent-space and discrete molecular optimization methods, demonstrating significant improvements across synthetic benchmarks and application-driven tasks.

Although many symbolic approaches have been presented, transient probability analysis of CRNs, modeled as Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs), requires explicit state representation. For that purpose, current cutting-edge methods use hash maps, which boast constant average time complexity and linear memory complexity. However, hash maps often suffer from severe memory limitations on models with immense state spaces. To address this, we propose using prefix trees to store states for large, highly concurrent models (particularly CRNs) for memory savings. We present theoretical analyses and benchmarks demonstrating the favorability of prefix trees over hash maps for very large state spaces. Additionally, we propose using a Bounded Model Checking (BMC) pre-processing step to impose a variable ordering to further improve memory usage along with preliminary evaluations suggesting its effectiveness.

However, common methods largely rely on co-occurrence, making them prone to item popularity bias and user attributes, which degrades embedding quality and performance. Meanwhile, although diversity is acknowledged as a key aspect of recommendation quality, existing research offers limited attention to it, with a notable lack of causal perspectives and theoretical grounding. To address these challenges, we propose Cadence: Diversity Recommendation via Causal Deconfounding of Co-purchase Relations and Counterfactual Exposure - a plug-and-play framework built upon LightGCN as the backbone, primarily designed to enhance recommendation diversity while preserving accuracy. First, we compute the Unbiased Asymmetric Co-purchase Relationship (UACR) between items - excluding item popularity and user attributes - to construct a deconfounded directed item graph, with an aggregation mechanism to refine embeddings. Second, we leverage UACR to identify diverse categories of items that exhibit strong causal relevance to a user's interacted items but have not yet been engaged with. We then simulate their behavior under high-exposure scenarios, thereby significantly enhancing recommendation diversity while preserving relevance.

We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption.

This yields a practical trilemma among censorship resistance, low latency, and reasonable cost (in fees or system goodput).\n  We present Sedna, a user-facing protocol that replaces naive transaction replication with verifiable, rateless coding. Users privately deliver addressed symbol bundles to subsets of proposers; execution follows a deterministic order once enough symbols are finalized to decode. We prove Sedna guarantees liveness and \\emph{until-decode privacy}, significantly reducing MEV exposure.

One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards.

Line Cover is known to be NP-hard, and we focus on two natural generalizations. The first is \\textbf{Line Clustering}, where the goal is to find $k$ lines minimizing the sum of squared distances from the input points to their nearest line. The second is \\textbf{Hyperplane Cover}, which asks whether $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ can be covered by $k$ hyperplanes.\n  We also study the more general \\textbf{Projective Clustering} problem, which unifies both settings and has applications in machine learning, data analysis, and computational geometry. In this problem, one seeks $k$ affine subspaces of dimension $r$ that minimize the sum of squared distances from the given points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to the nearest subspace.\n  Our results reveal notable differences in the parameterized complexity of these problems. While Line Cover is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by $k$, we show that Line Clustering is W[1]-hard with respect to $k$ and does not admit an algorithm with running time $n^{o(k)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails. Hyperplane Cover is NP-hard even for $d=2$, and prior work of Langerman and Morin [Discrete & Computational Geometry, 2005] showed that it is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by both $k$ and $d$. We complement this by proving that Hyperplane Cover is W[2]-hard when parameterized by $k$ alone.\n  Finally, we present an algorithm for Projective Clustering running in $n^{O(dk(r+1))}$ time.

By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality.

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49\u539f\u59cb\u5e73\u5747\u6cd5\uff08GPA\uff09\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u5355\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005DiLoCo\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e14\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5982\u5355\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005DiLoCo\u548cSchedule - Free\u5728\u975e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026Nesterov\u539f\u59cb\u5e73\u5747\u516c\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u4f7fGPA\u80fd\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u5e73\u6ed1\u5e73\u5747\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "GPA\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005DiLoCo\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6709\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u540e\u6094\u503c\u6709O(\u221aT)\u754c\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0cGPA\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u63d2\u503c\u5e38\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u539f\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

We propose a Solomonoff-inspired method that weights LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit. Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates. Across tasks, this highlights the value of algorithmic information-theoretic priors for interpretable, reliable multi-hypothesis reasoning under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7Solomonoff\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7Solomonoff\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u62df\u5408\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751fSolomonoff\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7528\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u683c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u4fdd\u5b88\u4e14\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u4e0e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSolomonoff\u8bc4\u5206\u80fd\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u5730\u5206\u914d\u6982\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Prior research has typically examined single issues such as class imbalance or feature irrelevance in isolation, overlooking that real-world data problems frequently co-occur and interact. This study presents, to our knowledge, the first large-scale empirical analysis in SDP that simultaneously examines five co-occurring data quality issues (class imbalance, class overlap, irrelevant features, attribute noise, and outliers) across 374 datasets and five classifiers. We employ Explainable Boosting Machines together with stratified interaction analysis to quantify both direct and conditional effects under default hyperparameter settings, reflecting practical baseline usage.\n  Our results show that co-occurrence is nearly universal: even the least frequent issue (attribute noise) appears alongside others in more than 93% of datasets. Irrelevant features and imbalance are nearly ubiquitous, while class overlap is the most consistently harmful issue. We identify stable tipping points around 0.20 for class overlap, 0.65-0.70 for imbalance, and 0.94 for irrelevance, beyond which most models begin to degrade. We also uncover counterintuitive patterns, such as outliers improving performance when irrelevant features are low, underscoring the importance of context-aware evaluation. Finally, we expose a performance-robustness trade-off: no single learner dominates under all conditions.\n  By jointly analyzing prevalence, co-occurrence, thresholds, and conditional effects, our study directly addresses a persistent gap in SDP research.

However, it still struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly in accurately associating objects with their corresponding attributes, because its inherent global representation often overlooks fine-grained semantics for attribute binding. Existing methods often require additional training or extensive hard negative sampling, yet they frequently show limited generalization to novel compositional concepts and fail to fundamentally address the drawbacks of global representations. In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity.

We propose a general regression framework that addresses this gap with unfairness penalties for multiple groups.

We additionally introduce novel score functions for automatically selecting penalty weights.

However, their deployment at the edge across distributed compute nodes (cloudlets) createssubstantial communication overhead due to repeated transmission of overlapping node features between neighbouring cloudlets. To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic.

Prior work has explored the NFT ecosystem from various perspectives, including security challenges, actor behaviors, and risks from scams and wash trading, leaving a gap in understanding the semantics and interactions of smart contracts during transactions, and how the risks associated with scam tokens manifest in relation to the semantics and interactions of contracts. To bridge this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on smart contract semantics and interactions in the NFT ecosystem, using a curated dataset of nearly 100 million transactions across 20 million blocks on Ethereum. We observe a limited semantic diversity among smart contracts in the NFT ecosystem, dominated by proxy, token, and DeFi contracts. Marketplace and proxy registry contracts are the most frequently involved in smart contract interactions during transactions, engaging with a broad spectrum of contracts in the ecosystem. Token contracts exhibit bytecode-level diversity, whereas scam tokens exhibit bytecode convergence. Certain interaction patterns between smart contracts are common to both risky and non-risky transactions, while others are predominantly associated with risky transactions.

The framework proposes a dual-stream architecture: a horizontal Mining Process that systematically transforms raw data into semantically rich, machine-actionable knowledge, and a parallel Trustworthy Archiving Stream that ensures the integrity, provenance, and computational reproducibility of these assets. By defining a blueprint for this symbiotic relationship, the paper provides a foundational model for transforming static repositories into living ecosystems that facilitate the flow of actionable intelligence from producers to consumers.

We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%).

Efficient point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data movement, such as multicast, is essential for high performance. However, native multicast support is lacking in standard interconnect protocols. Existing P2MP solutions, such as multicast-capable Network-on-Chip (NoC), impose additional overhead to the network hardware and require modifications to the interconnect protocol, compromising scalability and compatibility.\n  This paper introduces Torrent, a novel distributed DMA architecture that enables efficient P2MP data transfers without modifying NoC hardware and interconnect protocol. Torrent conducts P2MP data transfers by forming logical chains over the NoC, where the data traverses through targeted destinations resembling a linked list. This Chainwrite mechanism preserves the P2P nature of every data transfer while enabling flexible data transfers to an unlimited number of destinations. To optimize the performance and energy consumption of Chainwrite, two scheduling algorithms are developed to determine the optimal chain order based on NoC topology.\n  Our RTL and FPGA prototype evaluations using both synthetic and real workloads demonstrate significant advantages in performance, flexibility, and scalability over network-layer multicast. Compared to the unicast baseline, Torrent achieves up to a 7.88x speedup. ASIC synthesis on 16nm technology confirms the architecture's minimal footprint in area (1.2%) and power (2.3%). Thanks to the Chainwrite, Torrent delivers scalable P2MP data transfers with a small cycle overhead of 82CC and area overhead of 207um2 per destination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u7247\u4e0a\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fDMA\u67b6\u6784Torrent\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u70b9\u5bf9\u591a\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7247\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7247\u4e0a\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u5dee\u8ddd\u589e\u5927\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u534f\u8bae\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Torrent\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fDMA\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7247\u4e0a\u7f51\u7edc\u5f62\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u70b9\u5bf9\u591a\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\uff08Chainwrite\u673a\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u4e2a\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u591a\u64ad\u76f8\u6bd4\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u64ad\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u9ad8\u5b9e\u73b07.88\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0cASIC\u5408\u6210\u8868\u660e\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u529f\u8017\u5360\u7528\u5c0f\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\u6709\u5c0f\u7684\u5468\u671f\u548c\u9762\u79ef\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "Torrent\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u534f\u8bae\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u70b9\u5bf9\u591a\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u3002"}}

Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction.

However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN. Inspired by the ideas of orthogonality in canonical forms and determinism in circuits enabling tractable maximization, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to overcome their marginalization overhead. Our parameterizations unlock efficient marginalization even in factorizations different from TNs, but encoded as circuits, whose structure would otherwise make marginalization computationally hard. Finally, our experiments on distribution estimation show how our proposed conditions in squared circuits come with no expressiveness loss, while enabling more efficient learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u5e73\u65b9\u7535\u8def\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u5176\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e73\u65b9\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5e73\u65b9\u7535\u8def\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u5e73\u65b9\u8fd0\u7b97\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u914d\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5176\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u8303\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u89c4\u8303\u5f62\u5f0f\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u548c\u7535\u8def\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u601d\u60f3\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e73\u65b9\u7535\u8def\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e0e\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7535\u8def\u7684\u56e0\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u7535\u8def\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Dynamo action determines their dynamical structure and strength. Simulations of combined large- and small-scale dynamos have successfully developed mean fields with strength and topology consistent with observations but with turbulent fields much weaker than observed, while simulations of small-scale dynamos with parameters relevant to the interstellar medium yield turbulent fields an order of magnitude below the values observed or expected theoretically. We use the Pencil Code accelerated on GPUs with Astaroth to perform high-resolution simulations of a supernova-driven galactic dynamo including heating and cooling in a periodic domain. Our models show that the strength of the turbulent field produced by the small-scale dynamo approaches an asymptote at only modest magnetic Prandtl numbers. This allows us to use these models to suggest the essential characteristics of this constituent of the magnetic field for inclusion in global galactic models.

To appear in Hudl Performance Insights 2025", "summary": "Transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a football club's success, yet forecasting whether a transfer will succeed remains difficult due to the strong context-dependence of on-field performance. Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision.

The resulting adaptive process leverages further MPPI exploration where value estimates are uncertain, and improves training robustness and the overall resulting policies. This results in a robust planning approach that can handle complex planning problems and easily adapts to different applications, as demonstrated over several domains, including race driving, modified Acrobot, and Lunar Lander with added obstacles. Our results in these domains show better data efficiency and overall performance in terms of both rewards and task success, with up to a 72% increase in success rate compared to existing approaches, as well as accelerated convergence (x2.1) compared to non-adaptive sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548cMPC\u89c4\u5212\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548cMPC\u89c4\u5212\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfcMPPI\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u5408MPPI\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534772%\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb2.1\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6613\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, their black-box nature limits trust and adoption, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To address this challenge, we introduce UniCoMTE, a model-agnostic framework for generating counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series classifiers. The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples. Results show that our approach produces concise, stable, and human-aligned explanations that outperform existing methods in both clarity and applicability.

While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks.

The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u80fd\u5426\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u89c6\u89d2\u5b9a\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u5173\u5224\u65ad\u6307\u6807\u548c\u8fa9\u8bc1\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u80fd\u5426\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u5df2\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e14\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u5177\u6709\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u603b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6838\u5fc3\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u591a\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8fa9\u8bc1\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4f4e\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6982\u5ff5\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6982\u5ff5\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

This paper introduces AutoDFBench 1.0, a modular benchmarking framework that supports the evaluation of both conventional DF tools and scripts, as well as AI-generated code and agentic approaches. The framework integrates five areas defined by the CFTT programme: string search, deleted file recovery, file carving, Windows registry recovery, and SQLite data recovery. AutoDFBench 1.0 includes ground truth data comprising of 63 test cases and 10,968 unique test scenarios, and execute evaluations through a RESTful API that produces structured JSON outputs with standardised metrics, including precision, recall, and F1~score for each test case, and the average of these F1~scores becomes the AutoDFBench Score. The benchmarking framework is validated against CFTT's datasets. The framework enables fair and reproducible comparison across tools and forensic scripts, establishing the first unified, automated, and extensible benchmarking framework for digital forensic tool testing and validation.

Leveraging this property, a gradient-based fault parameters identification (GFPI) method using the Adahessian optimizer is developed to efficiently quantify partial shading, short-circuit, and series-resistance degradation.

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment.

On natural language understanding benchmarks, curvature-aware parameter selection outperforms magnitude-only baselines across all sparsity levels, with multi-task merging improving over strong baselines.

Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.\n  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u6df7\u5408\u7387\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u63a2\u7a76WFR\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u51f8\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u6df7\u5408\u7387\u4f1a\u6307\u6570\u6076\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u5bf9\u6570\u51f9\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\uff0c\u5229\u7528Feynman - Kac\u8868\u793a\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eWFR\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u6b65\u4f46\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8eWFR\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories.

In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks.

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design.

In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language. Through this work, we hope to better understand the internal behavior of CLIP and improve its handling of negation using clinically relevant language for improving its reliability in medical AI devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30Stanford AIMI CheXagent\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u542b\u5426\u5b9a\u77ed\u8bed\u7684\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347CLIP\u5728\u533b\u5b66AI\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u77ed\u8bed\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u533b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30Stanford AIMI CheXagent\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u542b\u548c\u4e0d\u542b\u5426\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e4b\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7token\u5f52\u56e0\u3001t - SNE\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u80af\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u671b\u66f4\u597d\u7406\u89e3CLIP\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u533b\u5b66AI\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

How such distributed control gives rise to precise global patterns remains a central question not only in developmental biology but also in distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDiffeoMorph\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60\u5f62\u6001\u53d1\u751f\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f62\u6210\u76ee\u68073D\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u6709\u65b0\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u4ea7\u751f\u7cbe\u786e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684SE(3)\u7b49\u53d8\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66f4\u65b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e3D Zernike\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6b65\u9aa4\u5904\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc1\u660e\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6807\u51c6\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0cDiffeoMorph\u80fd\u4ec5\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u5f62\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "conclusion": "DiffeoMorph\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f62\u6210\u76ee\u68073D\u5f62\u72b6\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Our goal is to achieve a globally stable and interference-aware channel allocation. Stability is defined through a generalized Gale-Shapley multi-to-one matching, a well-established solution concept in wireless resource allocation. We consider wireless networks where L cells share S orthogonal channels and cannot simultaneously use the same channel as their neighbors. Each channel evolves as an unknown restless Markov process with cell-dependent rewards, making this the first work to establish global Gale-Shapley stability for channel allocation in a stochastic, temporally varying restless environment. To address this challenge, we develop SMILE (Stable Multi-matching with Interference-aware LEarning), a communication-efficient distributed learning algorithm that integrates restless bandit learning with graph-constrained coordination.

BumpNet is based on meshless basis function expansion, in a similar fashion to radial-basis function (RBF) networks.

This enables the efficient use of modern training techniques optimized for such networks. All parameters of the basis functions, including shape, location, and amplitude, are fully trainable. Model parsimony and h-adaptivity are effectively achieved through dynamically pruning basis functions during training. BumpNet is a general framework that can be combined with existing neural architectures for learning PDE solutions: here, we propose Bump-PINNs (BumpNet with physics-informed neural networks) for solving general PDEs; Bump-EDNN (BumpNet with evolutionary deep neural networks) to solve time-evolution PDEs; and Bump-DeepONet (BumpNet with deep operator networks) for PDE operator learning. Bump-PINNs are trained using the same collocation-based approach used by PINNs, Bump-EDNN uses a BumpNet only in the spatial domain and uses EDNNs to advance the solution in time, while Bump-DeepONets employ a BumpNet regression network as the trunk network of a DeepONet.

New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir. Particularly representations of finer branches contribute to the decisions of the models. The models consider those tree species similar to each other which a human expert would also regard as similar. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of the decision processes of tree species classification models to help reveal data set and model limitations, biases, and to build confidence in model predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fde\u63a5Finer - CAM\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0eTLS\u6295\u5f71\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6811\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe96%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6811\u51a0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e5f\u51f8\u663e\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\uff0cFiner - CAM\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u6811\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u54ea\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u9a71\u52a8\u6811\u79cd\u533a\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06Finer - CAM\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0eTLS\u6295\u5f71\u7247\u6bb5\u5173\u8054\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u75282445\u68f5\u6811\u7684TLS\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2aYOLOv8\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe96%\uff0c\u5206\u6790630\u5f20\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6811\u51a0\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6811\u79cd\u5bf9\u6811\u51a0\u548c\u6811\u5e72\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6811\u79cd\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u4e0e\u4eba\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u6811\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3001\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002"}}

Although data-driven models have shown promise, their performance often deteriorates when the geometric structures governing long-term behavior are unknown or poorly represented. We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection.

We introduce a method that approaches video generation in a filmmaker-like manner. Instead of creating a video in one step, our proposed pipeline first uses a large language model to generate a detailed production script. This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u4eff\u7535\u5f71\u5236\u4f5c\u4eba\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u89e3\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891AI\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u8fde\u8d2f\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u6545\u4e8b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u5236\u4f5c\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u7528\u811a\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u89d2\u8272\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u5f62\u8c61\uff0c\u518d\u8ba9\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u53bb\u9664\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u4f1a\u4f7f\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

While this experience learning capability enhances agentic autonomy, it introduces a critical, unexplored attack surface, i.e., the trust boundary between an agent's reasoning core and its own past. In this paper, we introduce MemoryGraft. It is a novel indirect injection attack that compromises agent behavior not through immediate jailbreaks, but by implanting malicious successful experiences into the agent's long-term memory. Unlike traditional prompt injections that are transient, or standard RAG poisoning that targets factual knowledge, MemoryGraft exploits the agent's semantic imitation heuristic which is the tendency to replicate patterns from retrieved successful tasks. We demonstrate that an attacker who can supply benign ingestion-level artifacts that the agent reads during execution can induce it to construct a poisoned RAG store where a small set of malicious procedure templates is persisted alongside benign experiences. When the agent later encounters semantically similar tasks, union retrieval over lexical and embedding similarity reliably surfaces these grafted memories, and the agent adopts the embedded unsafe patterns, leading to persistent behavioral drift across sessions. We validate MemoryGraft on MetaGPT's DataInterpreter agent with GPT-4o and find that a small number of poisoned records can account for a large fraction of retrieved experiences on benign workloads, turning experience-based self-improvement into a vector for stealthy and durable compromise.

However, real-world QoS data are extremely sparse, noisy, and shaped by hierarchical dependencies arising from QoS interactions, and geographical and network-level factors, making accurate QoS prediction challenging. Existing methods often predict each QoS parameter separately, requiring multiple similar models, which increases computational cost and leads to poor generalization. Although recent joint QoS prediction studies have explored shared architectures, they suffer from negative transfer due to loss-scaling caused by inconsistent numerical ranges across QoS parameters and further struggle with inadequate representation learning, resulting in degraded accuracy. This paper presents an unified strategy for joint QoS prediction, called SHARP-QoS, that addresses these issues using three components. First, we introduce a dual mechanism to extract the hierarchical features from both QoS and contextual structures via hyperbolic convolution formulated in the Poincar\u00e9 ball. Second, we propose an adaptive feature-sharing mechanism that allows feature exchange across informative QoS and contextual signals. A gated feature fusion module is employed to support dynamic feature selection among structural and shared representations. Third, we design an EMA-based loss balancing strategy that allows stable joint optimization, thereby mitigating the negative transfer. Evaluations on three datasets with two, three, and four QoS parameters demonstrate that SHARP-QoS outperforms both single- and multi-task baselines.

While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to state similarity between multiple MDPs remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to extend BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of well-established mathematical properties has limited further theoretical analysis between MDPs. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) for measuring state similarity between arbitrary pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with three fundamental metric properties, i.e., GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and a distance bound on identical spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyze policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation across MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than existing ones derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49\u53cc\u6a21\u62df\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08GBSM\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u4efb\u610f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDP\uff09\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u5ea6\u91cf\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8de8MDP\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8f6c\u79fb\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u754c\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u6a21\u62df\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08BSM\uff09\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMDP\u95f4\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u6269\u5c55\u7f3a\u4e4f\u826f\u597d\u6570\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u6b63\u5f0f\u5efa\u7acbGBSM\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3001MDP\u95f4\u4e09\u89d2\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u76f8\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u754c\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u5ea6\u91cf\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8de8MDP\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u805a\u5408\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6BSM\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u754c\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u660eGBSM\u5728\u591aMDP\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

This degradation can be attributed to distribution shifts, including user, character, and dialogue compositional shifts. Existing methods like LLM-as-a-judge fall short in providing a fine-grained diagnosis of how these shifts affect RPM generalization, and thus there lack formal frameworks to characterize RPM generalization behaviors. To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID.

Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs.

However, recent studies show that these DL-based systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks; small perturbations to sensor inputs can degrade model performance, trigger incorrect mitigation, and disrupt the user's immersive experience (UIX). Additionally, there is a lack of dedicated open-source testbeds that evaluate the robustness of these systems under adversarial conditions, limiting the ability to assess their real-world effectiveness. To address this gap, this paper introduces Adversarial-VR, a novel real-time VR testbed for evaluating DL-based cybersickness detection and mitigation strategies under adversarial conditions. Developed in Unity, the testbed integrates two state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL models: DeepTCN and Transformer, which are trained on the open-source MazeSick dataset, for real-time cybersickness severity detection and applies a dynamic visual tunneling mechanism that adjusts the field-of-view based on model outputs. To assess robustness, we incorporate three SOTA adversarial attacks: MI-FGSM, PGD, and C&W, which successfully prevent cybersickness mitigation by fooling DL-based cybersickness models' outcomes. We implement these attacks using a testbed with a custom-built VR Maze simulation and an HTC Vive Pro Eye headset, and we open-source our implementation for widespread adoption by VR developers and researchers. Results show that these adversarial attacks are capable of successfully fooling the system. For instance, the C&W attack results in a $5.94x decrease in accuracy for the Transformer-based cybersickness model compared to the accuracy without the attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAdversarial - VR\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6655\u52a8\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u6b3a\u9a97\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6655\u52a8\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u5b9e\u6548\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eUnity\u7684Adversarial - VR\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u96c6\u6210DeepTCN\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528MI - FGSM\u3001PGD\u548cC&W\u4e09\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49VR\u8ff7\u5bab\u6a21\u62df\u548cHTC Vive Pro Eye\u8033\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u6b3a\u9a97\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5982C&W\u653b\u51fb\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6655\u52a8\u75c7\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d5.94\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Adversarial - VR\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6655\u52a8\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce Multi view Adaptive Transport Clustering for Heterogeneous Alzheimer's Disease (MATCH-AD), a semi supervised framework that integrates deep representation learning, graph-based label propagation, and optimal transport theory to address this limitation. The framework leverages manifold structure in neuroimaging data to propagate diagnostic information from limited labeled samples to larger unlabeled populations, while using Wasserstein distances to quantify disease progression between cognitive states. Evaluated on nearly five thousand subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, encompassing structural MRI measurements from hundreds of brain regions, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical variables MATCHAD achieves near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite ground truth labels for less than one-third of subjects. The framework substantially outperforms all baseline methods, achieving kappa indicating almost perfect agreement compared to weak agreement for the best baseline, a qualitative transformation in diagnostic reliability. Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability.

However, there is not a consistent definition or test to demonstrate inherent explainability. Work to date either characterises explainability through metrics, or appeals to intuition - \"we know it when we see it\". We propose a globally applicable criterion for inherent explainability. The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \\textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation. Finally, we provide a full explanation of PREDICT -- a Cox proportional hazards model of cardiovascular disease risk, which is in active clinical use in New Zealand. It follows that PREDICT is inherently explainable.

This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u4ea4\u6613\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5fc3\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u771f\u5b9e\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u4ea4\u6613\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u79cd\u81ea\u6211\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e30\u5bcc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u6613\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002"}}

Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:\n  1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms\n  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)\n  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba\n  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e09\u8005\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3ICL\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4ee5\u5f80\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u7684\u89c2\u70b9", "method": "\u5bf99\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea7\u4e2aTransformer\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53caMamba\u8fdb\u884c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8865\u4e01\u5b9e\u9a8c", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u5148\u9a8c - \u6a21\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u74f6\u9888", "conclusion": "\u4e3aICL\u7684\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8ICL\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027"}}

Most bot-detection systems still treat behavioural features as static, implicitly assuming bots behave stationarily over time. We test that assumption for promotional Twitter bots, analysing change in both individual behavioural signals and the relationships between them. Using 2,615 promotional bot accounts and 2.8M tweets, we build yearly time series for ten content-based meta-features. Augmented Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests plus linear trends show all ten are non-stationary: nine increase over time, while language diversity declines slightly.\n  Stratifying by activation generation and account age reveals systematic differences: second-generation bots are most active and link-heavy; short-lived bots show intense, repetitive activity with heavy hashtag/URL use; long-lived bots are less active but more linguistically diverse and use emojis more variably. We then analyse co-occurrence across generations using 18 interpretable binary features spanning actions, topic similarity, URLs, hashtags, sentiment, emojis, and media (153 pairs). Chi-square tests indicate almost all pairs are dependent.

Machine learning (ML) models are widely adopted to detect such content; however, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein malicious users subtly modify text to evade detection. Enhancing adversarial robustness is therefore essential, requiring detectors that can defend against diverse attacks (generalizability) while maintaining high overall accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor. We addressed several limitations of existing adversarial robustness enhancement research and empirically evaluated ARHOCD across three datasets spanning hate speech, rumor, and extremist content.

Evaluation and methodology study on dialogue topic segmentation", "summary": "Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.\n  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.\n  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u6e90\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ee5\u4e25\u683c\u8fb9\u754c\u5339\u914d\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eF1\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4ee5\u8fb9\u754c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u7247\u6bb5\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a97\u53e3\u5bb9\u5fcdF1\uff08W - F1\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u516b\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u7531\u6807\u6ce8\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u8fb9\u754c\u6807\u7b7e\u5bfc\u81f4\uff0c\u9ad8\u7247\u6bb5\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4f1a\u4f34\u968f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4f4e\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914dF1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u5e94\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u4e00\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u79bb\u3002"}}

We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks.

In this setting, the owner of the network runs inference on the data of the client without learning anything about the data and without revealing any information about the model. It has been observed that a major computational bottleneck of PI is the calculation of the gate (i.e., ReLU), so a considerable amount of effort have been devoted to reducing the number of ReLUs in a given network.\n  We focus on the DReLU, which is the non-linear step function of the ReLU and show that one DReLU can serve many ReLU operations. We suggest a new activation module where the DReLU operation is only performed on a subset of the channels (Prototype channels), while the rest of the channels (replicate channels) replicates the DReLU of each of their neurons from the corresponding neurons in one of the prototype channels.

Traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods, which often rely on feature-based or example-based explanations, struggle to deliver dynamic, context-specific, personalized, and human-centric insights for everyday AR users. These methods typically address separate explainability dimensions (e.g., when, what, how) with different explanation techniques, resulting in unrealistic and fragmented experiences for seamless AR interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PILAR, a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate context-aware, personalized explanations, offering a more intuitive and trustworthy experience in real-time AI-powered AR systems. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on multiple techniques for different aspects of explanation, PILAR employs a unified LLM-based approach that dynamically adapts explanations to the user's needs, fostering greater trust and engagement. We implement the PILAR concept in a real-world AR application (e.g., personalized recipe recommendations), an open-source prototype that integrates real-time object detection, recipe recommendation, and LLM-based personalized explanations of the recommended recipes based on users' dietary preferences. We evaluate the effectiveness of PILAR through a user study with 16 participants performing AR-based recipe recommendation tasks, comparing an LLM-based explanation interface to a traditional template-based one. Results show that the LLM-based interface significantly enhances user performance and experience, with participants completing tasks 40% faster and reporting greater satisfaction, ease of use, and perceived transparency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPILAR\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684AR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfXAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728AR\u98df\u8c31\u63a8\u8350\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfXAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6AR\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPILAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9eAR\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "LLM-based\u754c\u9762\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb40%\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3001\u6613\u7528\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "PILAR\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684AR\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Although Inconel 625 shows excellent creep resistance, finite-element creep simulations in tools such as ANSYS remain computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run. This work proposes deep learning based surrogate models to provide fast and accurate replacements for such simulations. Creep strain data was generated in ANSYS using the Norton law under uniaxial stresses of 50 to 150 MPa and temperatures of 700 to 1000 $^\\circ$C, and this temporal dataset was used to train two architectures: a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder for uncertainty-aware and generative predictions, and a BiLSTM Transformer hybrid that employs self-attention to capture long-range temporal behavior. Both models act as surrogate predictors, with the BiLSTM-VAE offering probabilistic output and the BiLSTM-Transformer delivering high deterministic accuracy. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$. Results show that the BiLSTM-VAE provides stable and reliable creep strain forecasts, while the BiLSTM-Transformer achieves strong accuracy across the full time range. Latency tests indicate substantial speedup: while each ANSYS simulation requires 30 to 40 minutes for a given stress-temperature condition, the surrogate models produce predictions within seconds.

Accepted at ACRA 2025 (Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation)", "summary": "Interactive reinforcement learning (IRL) has shown promise in enabling autonomous agents and robots to learn complex behaviours from human teachers, yet the dynamics of teacher selection remain poorly understood. This paper reveals an unexpected phenomenon in IRL: when given a choice between teachers with different reward structures, learning agents overwhelmingly prefer conservative, low-reward teachers (93.16% selection rate) over those offering 20x higher rewards. Through 1,250 experimental runs in navigation tasks with multiple expert teachers, we discovered: (1) Conservative bias dominates teacher selection: agents systematically choose the lowest-reward teacher, prioritising consistency over optimality; (2) Critical performance thresholds exist at teacher availability rho >= 0.6 and accuracy omega >= 0.6, below which the framework fails catastrophically; (3) The framework achieves 159% improvement over baseline Q-learning under concept drift. These findings challenge fundamental assumptions about optimal teaching in RL and suggest potential implications for human-robot collaboration, where human preferences for safety and consistency may align with the observed agent selection behaviour, potentially informing training paradigms for safety-critical robotic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9009\u62e9\u6559\u5e08\u65f6\u503e\u5411\u4fdd\u5b88\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u6210\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebfQ\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u6559\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6559\u5e08\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c1250\u6b21\u6709\u591a\u4f4d\u4e13\u5bb6\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u4fdd\u5b88\u504f\u5dee\u9009\u62e9\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6559\u5e08\uff1b\u6559\u5e08\u53ef\u7528\u6027rho >= 0.6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387omega >= 0.6\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfQ\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347159%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6311\u6218\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u6559\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bf9\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

We quantify probability quality using Brier score, Expected Calibration Error (ECE; 15 bins), and reliability diagrams. Shortcut susceptibility is probed via composition-preserving residue shuffles and length-/composition-only ablations. Empirically, random splits substantially overestimate robustness relative to homology-clustered evaluation; calibrated linear models exhibit comparatively good calibration, while tree ensembles retain slightly higher Brier/ECE.

This paper introduces Collaborative Forward-Forward (CFF) learning, extending the original algorithm through inter-layer cooperation mechanisms that preserve forward-only computation while enabling global context integration. Our framework implements two collaborative paradigms: Fixed CFF (F-CFF) with constant inter-layer coupling and Adaptive CFF (A-CFF) with learnable collaboration parameters that evolve during training. The collaborative goodness function incorporates weighted contributions from all layers, enabling coordinated feature learning while maintaining memory efficiency and biological plausibility.

The development of the diffusion models (DM) and the end-to-end models (E2E model) has greatly improved the frontier of pansharping. DM takes the multi-step diffusion to obtain an accurate estimation of the residual between LRMSI and HRMSI. However, the multi-step process takes large computational power and is time-consuming. As for E2E models, their performance is still limited by the lack of prior and simple structure. In this paper, we propose a novel four-stage training strategy to obtain a lightweight network Fose, which fuses one-step DM and an E2E model. We perform one-step distillation on an enhanced SOTA DM for pansharping to compress the inference process from 50 steps to only 1 step. Then we fuse the E2E model with one-step DM with lightweight ensemble blocks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the significant improvement of the proposed Fose on three commonly used benchmarks.

We empirically benchmark these methods against existing methods and demonstrate their superiority over the state-of-the-art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u8026\u9ed1\u7bb1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u53d8\u79cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u6602\u8d35\u5168\u5c40\u9ed1\u7bb1\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u8026\u9ed1\u7bb1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u591f\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u53d8\u79cd\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5904\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u79cd\u5728\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u8026\u9ed1\u7bb1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, when faced with complex and curved pipeline scenarios, these methods often fail due to problems such as cable entanglement and insufficient equipment flexibility. To address this pain point, we designed a self-propelled pipeline robot. This robot can autonomously complete the location work of complex and curved pipelines in complex pipe networks without external dragging. In terms of pipeline mapping technology, traditional visual mapping and laser mapping methods are easily affected by lighting conditions and insufficient features in the confined space of pipelines, resulting in mapping drift and divergence problems. In contrast, the pipeline location method that integrates inertial navigation and wheel odometers is less affected by pipeline environmental factors. Based on this, this paper proposes a pipeline robot location method based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF). Firstly, the body attitude angle is initially obtained through an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Then, the extended Kalman filtering algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of attitude angle estimation. Finally, high-precision pipeline location is achieved by combining wheel odometers. During the testing phase, the roll wheels of the pipeline robot needed to fit tightly against the pipe wall to reduce slippage. However, excessive tightness would reduce the flexibility of motion control due to excessive friction. Therefore, a balance needed to be struck between the robot's motion capability and positioning accuracy. Experiments were conducted using the self-propelled pipeline robot in a rectangular loop pipeline, and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed dead reckoning algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f2f\u66f2\u7ba1\u9053\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u63a8\u8fdb\u7ba1\u9053\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u822a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f2f\u66f2\u7ba1\u9053\u573a\u666f\u6613\u56e0\u7535\u7f06\u7f20\u7ed5\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ba1\u9053\u6d4b\u7ed8\u6280\u672f\u53d7\u7ba1\u9053\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u63a8\u8fdb\u7ba1\u9053\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u5355\u5143\u83b7\u53d6\u521d\u59cb\u59ff\u6001\u89d2\uff0c\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u59ff\u6001\u89d2\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6e\u5f0f\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u77e9\u5f62\u73af\u5f62\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u63a8\u8fdb\u7ba1\u9053\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u822a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5f2f\u66f2\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

These incidents not only raise technical issues but also carry complex moral implications, rendering conventional, technologically driven, and reactive management methods inadequate to address the underlying causes of the problem, including intent, morality, and potential intangible social impacts. Based on these issues, this study aims to formulate a comprehensive Islamic ethical framework that can serve as a more comprehensive preventative tool to mitigate the risks of misuse of deepfakes. The study employed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) guided by PRISMA, selecting ten primary sources published between 2018 and 2025 to identify ethical deficiencies, regulatory needs, and appropriate normative solutions. The analysis shows that the integration of the principles of (Maqasid al-Shariah) particularly (hifz al-ird) protecting honor and (hifz al-nafs) protecting the self, provides a strong normative basis for regulating the responsible use of technology. This study yields three strategic recommendations: regulatory changes that recognize the intangible and psychological harm caused by reputational damage; improved technology management through moral scrutiny that upholds the values of justice (adl), trust, and openness; and increased public digital literacy based on the principle of (tabayyun) examination and caution. Overall, this study concludes that the application of Islamic ethics offers a shift in thinking from punitive mechanisms to preventative approaches that focus on protecting human dignity, preventing harm, and strengthening the common good in the digital age.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u5f15\u53d1\u5168\u7403\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5236\u5b9a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u6ee5\u7528\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SLR\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e09\u9879\u6218\u7565\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5e94\u7528\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u4f26\u7406\u80fd\u4ece\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u5411\u9884\u9632\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u76d7\u7528\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7b49\u6839\u6e90\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u5236\u5b9a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u6ee5\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8ePRISMA\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff08SLR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9009\u53d62018 - 2025\u5e74\u7684\u5341\u7bc7\u4e3b\u8981\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4f26\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u6559\u6cd5\u539f\u5219\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4fdd\u62a4\u8363\u8a89\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u81ea\u6211\uff09\u7684\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e09\u9879\u6218\u7565\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u7528\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u4f26\u7406\u80fd\u4ece\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u5411\u9884\u9632\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4fdd\u62a4\u4eba\u7c7b\u5c0a\u4e25\u3001\u9632\u6b62\u4f24\u5bb3\u548c\u52a0\u5f3a\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u516c\u5171\u5229\u76ca\u3002"}}

The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required.\n  The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist. The resulting synthetic mobility data reproduce dwell-travel time and visit frequency distributions with high fidelity, while deviations in OD consistency remain within the natural range of daily fluctuations.\n  The results of this study establish a practical synthesis pathway under real-world constraints, providing governments, urban planners, and industries with scalable access to high-resolution mobility data for reliable analytics without the need for sensitive personal records, and supporting practical deployments in policy and commercial domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5408\u6210\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u805a\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u65e5\u5e38\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u4e24\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2a\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u96be\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u8bb0\u5f55\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u65e5\u5e38\u79fb\u52a8\u5173\u952e\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06OD\u6d41\u4e0e\u505c\u7559 - \u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u548c\u6bcf\u65e5\u8bbf\u95ee\u5730\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u666e\u904d\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e24\u4e2a\u884c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u73b0\u505c\u7559 - \u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0cOD\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u6ce2\u52a8\u81ea\u7136\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5408\u6210\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u8ba9\u591a\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u9700\u654f\u611f\u4e2a\u4eba\u8bb0\u5f55\u5c31\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Submitted to ICRA 2026", "summary": "Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) is a prominent paradigm for autonomous driving, where agents are required to optimize performance under strict safety requirements. This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76SRPL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u5956\u52b1 - \u5b89\u5168\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76SRPL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5426\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5728Waymo Open Motion Dataset\u548cNuPlan\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "SRPL\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u5956\u52b1 - \u5b89\u5168\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u793a\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u52a0\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own.

Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers.

Firstly, we consider the case of neural networks with a single hidden layer and we derive an integral infinite width neural representation that generalizes existing continuous neural networks (CNNs) representations. Then we extend this to deep residual CNNs that have a finite number of integral hidden layers and residual connections. Secondly, we revisit the relation between neural ODEs and deep residual NNs and we formalize approximation errors via discretization techniques. Then, we merge these two approaches into a unified homogeneous representation of NNs as a Distributed Parameter neural Network (DiPaNet) and we show that most of the existing finite and infinite-dimensional NNs architectures are related via homogeneization/discretization with the DiPaNet representation.

Using a human behavioral dataset adapted from the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), we show that differences in graph-based priors can explain individual differences in human solutions.

Nevertheless, we find that both approaches exhibit notable trade-offs and inconsistent performance across PDE types. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid strategy that combines the strengths of hard and easy prioritization through an alternating training algorithm. On PDEs with steep gradients, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality, the proposed method achieves consistently high accuracy, with relative L2 errors mostly in the range of O(10^-5) to O(10^-6), significantly surpassing baseline methods.

The gold standard is user feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down) or behavioral signals (e.g., retention), but these are often scarce in prototypes and research projects, or too-slow to use for system optimization. We present AutoMetrics, a framework for synthesizing evaluation metrics under low-data constraints. AutoMetrics combines retrieval from MetricBank, a collection of 48 metrics we curate, with automatically generated LLM-as-a-Judge criteria informed by lightweight human feedback. These metrics are composed via regression to maximize correlation with human signal. AutoMetrics takes you from expensive measures to interpretable automatic metrics.

In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI.

A Wavelet-denoised High-Frequency-guided Feature (WHF) module is employed to enhance low-level representations through noise-suppressed high-frequency cues. A Dual Attention Feature Fusion (DAFF) module is also introduced to effectively merge skip-connected and semantic features, improving contextual consistency.Extensive experiments on two public BUS datasets demonstrate that WDFFU-Mamba achieves superior segmentation accuracy, significantly outperforming existing methods in terms of Dice coefficient and 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95).The combination of wavelet-domain enhancement and attention-based fusion greatly improves both the accuracy and robustness of BUS image segmentation, while maintaining computational efficiency.The proposed WDFFU-Mamba model not only delivers strong segmentation performance but also exhibits desirable generalization ability across datasets, making it a promising solution for real-world clinical applications in breast tumor ultrasound analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faWDFFU - Mamba\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u9762\u4e34\u6591\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6210\u50cf\u4f2a\u5f71\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWDFFU - Mamba\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5f15\u5bfc\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u4e8eU\u578bMamba\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528WHF\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\uff0cDAFF\u6a21\u5757\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWDFFU - Mamba\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728Dice\u7cfb\u6570\u548cHD95\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u597d\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4f73\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e73\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u8d85\u58f0\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

This research aims to improve current NLP models or make a novel one for automated subjective question generation and answer evaluation from text input.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdNLP\u6280\u672f\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e3b\u89c2\u9898\u751f\u6210\u53ca\u7b54\u6848\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6539\u8fdb\u6216\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u7684NLP\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e3b\u89c2\u9898\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u6559\u5e08\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u751f\u4f5c\u4e1a\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709NLP\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e3b\u89c2\u9898\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, most existing feature selection approaches either operate as multi-stage pipelines or rely on post hoc feature attribution, making selection and prediction weakly coupled. In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

We show that text-only LLMs can perform competitively with multimodal vision-language models on RS reasoning tasks without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between current benchmarks and the intended evaluation of visual understanding. To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning. RSHR-Bench contains 5,329 full-scene images with a long side of at least 4,000 pixels, with up to about 3 x 10^8 pixels per image, sourced from widely used RS corpora and UAV collections. We design four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification. Overall, we construct 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written or verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs.

A Benchmark for Long-Range Graph Propagation", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Effectively capturing long-range interactions remains a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in graph neural network (GNN) research, critical for applications across diverse fields of science. To systematically address this, we introduce ECHO (Evaluating Communication over long HOps), a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess the capabilities of GNNs in handling very long-range graph propagation. ECHO includes three synthetic graph tasks, namely single-source shortest paths, node eccentricity, and graph diameter, each constructed over diverse and structurally challenging topologies intentionally designed to introduce significant information bottlenecks. ECHO also includes two real-world datasets, ECHO-Charge and ECHO-Energy, which define chemically grounded benchmarks for predicting atomic partial charges and molecular total energies, respectively, with reference computations obtained at the density functional theory (DFT) level.

This misalignment often triggers driver-initiated takeovers and system disengagements during closed-loop execution. How to leverage those expert takeover data from disengagement scenarios and effectively expand the IL policy's capability presents a valuable yet unexplored challenge. In this paper, we propose TakeAD, a novel preference-based post-optimization framework that fine-tunes the pre-trained IL policy with this disengagement data to enhance the closed-loop driving performance. First, we design an efficient expert takeover data collection pipeline inspired by human takeover mechanisms in real-world autonomous driving systems. Then, this post optimization framework integrates iterative Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) for imitation learning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for preference alignment. The DAgger stage equips the policy with fundamental capabilities to handle disengagement states through direct imitation of expert interventions. Subsequently, the DPO stage refines the policy's behavior to better align with expert preferences in disengagement scenarios. Through multiple iterations, the policy progressively learns recovery strategies for disengagement states, thereby mitigating the open-loop gap.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical approach for effectively adapting LMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods face two primary challenges: (1) High resource cost. Although PEFT methods significantly reduce resource demands compared to full fine-tuning, it still requires substantial time and memory, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. (2) Parameter dependency. PEFT methods heavily rely on updating a subset of parameters associated with LMs to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Yet, due to increasing competition in the LMs landscape, many companies have adopted closed-source policies for their leading models, offering access only via Application Programming Interface (APIs). Whereas, the expense is often cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain, as the fine-tuning process of LMs is extremely slow. Even if small models perform far worse than LMs in general, they can achieve superior results on particular distributions while requiring only minimal resources. Motivated by this insight, we propose Easy Adaptation (EA), which designs Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement the underfitted data distribution for LMs. Extensive experiments show that EA matches the performance of PEFT on diverse tasks without accessing LM parameters, and requires only minimal resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u4f46\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faEasy Adaptation\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u5c11\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0ePEFT\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEasy Adaptation (EA)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1Specific Small Models (SSMs)\u6765\u8865\u5145\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "EA\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0ePEFT\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u6781\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "EA\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6781\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0ePEFT\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To do so, several works completely replace ID embeddings with modality embeddings, claiming that modality embeddings render ID embeddings unnecessary because they can match or even exceed ID embedding performance. On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other. Motivated by this, we propose a new SR method that preserves ID-text complementarity through independent model training, then harnesses it through a simple ensembling strategy.

Based on real-world evidence from democratic innovations in participatory budgeting, in Switzerland and beyond, I highlight a trilogy of key research results: Fair voting methods achieve to be (i) legitimacy incubator, (ii) novel impact accelerator and (iii) safeguard for risks of artificial intelligence (AI). Compared to majoritarian voting methods, combining expressive ballot formats (e.g. cumulative voting) with ballot aggregation methods that promote proportional representation (e.g. equal shares) results in more winners and higher (geographical) representation of citizens. Such fair voting methods are preferred and found fairer even by voters who do not win, while promoting stronger democratic values for citizens such as altruism and compromise. They also result in new resourceful ideas to put for voting, which are cost-effective and win, especially in areas of welfare, education and culture. Strikingly, fair voting methods are also more resilient to biases and inconsistencies of generative AI in emerging scenarios of AI voting assistance or AI representation of voters who would be likely to abstain. I also review the relevance of such upgrades for democracies in crisis, such as the one of Greece featured in the recent study of `Unmute Democracy'.

K-OTG trains on a dual-path corpus: authorized examples (prefixed with a role key) learn the task output, while unauthorized examples learn a visible block token. At inference, a pre-lm_head hook applies an orthonormal transform to the hidden state: with the correct key/role the inverse map restores the model's native basis; otherwise a session-ephemeral scrambler (permutation, sign flips, Householders) makes logits uninformative and the system short-circuits to BLOCK. Keys are not added as special tokens, and the method composes cleanly with LoRA on 4-bit bases. We evaluate an hour-scale protocol on 1-3B-class instruction models (Llama 3.2, Qwen2.5 1.5B) across utility (XSum ROUGE/BLEU, GSM8K accuracy, WikiText-2 perplexity), selectivity (3by3 role-key unlock matrices), nonce invariance, block suppression, and throughput. Authorized utility remains close to the base on summarization with the expected modest PPL increase from instruction tuning; unauthorized utility collapses (near-zero sequence metrics with exploding PPL), indicating practical unusability without the key.

Effective flow control can lead to, e.g., lift increase, drag reduction, mixing enhancement, and noise reduction. However, controlling a fluid faces several significant challenges, including high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale interactions in space and time. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown great success in complex domains, such as robotics and protein folding, but its application to flow control is hindered by a lack of standardized benchmark platforms and the computational demands of fluid simulations. To address these challenges, we introduce HydroGym, a solver-independent RL platform for flow control research. HydroGym integrates sophisticated flow control benchmarks, scalable runtime infrastructure, and state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Our platform includes 42 validated environments spanning from canonical laminar flows to complex three-dimensional turbulent scenarios, validated over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. We provide non-differentiable solvers for traditional RL and differentiable solvers that dramatically improve sample efficiency through gradient-enhanced optimization. Comprehensive evaluation reveals that RL agents consistently discover robust control principles across configurations, such as boundary layer manipulation, acoustic feedback disruption, and wake reorganization. Transfer learning studies demonstrate that controllers learned at one Reynolds number or geometry adapt efficiently to new conditions, requiring approximately 50% fewer training episodes.

Models including LightGBM, Random Forest, and CatBoost were trained on nutrient concentration data. LightGBM performed best, achieving 80-85% accuracy across different nutrient panels and effectively distinguishing minimally from ultra-processed foods. Exploratory analysis revealed strong associations between higher NOVA classes and lower Nutri-Scores, indicating poorer nutritional quality.

However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images. Additionally, a web application for online fashion and shopping powered by ClothHMR is developed, illustrating that ClothHMR can effectively serve real-world usage scenarios.

However, the effectiveness of these techniques cannot be taken for granted in the case of modern large-scale ASR models trained on diverse, noisy data. We present a systematic evaluation of MetricGAN-plus-voicebank denoising on four state-of-the-art ASR systems: OpenAI Whisper, NVIDIA Parakeet, Google Gemini Flash 2.0, Parrotlet-a using 500 medical speech recordings under nine noise conditions. ASR performance is measured using semantic WER (semWER), a normalized word error rate (WER) metric accounting for domain-specific normalizations. Our results reveal a counterintuitive finding: speech enhancement preprocessing degrades ASR performance across all noise conditions and models. Original noisy audio achieves lower semWER than enhanced audio in all 40 tested configurations (4 models x 10 conditions), with degradations ranging from 1.1% to 46.6% absolute semWER increase. These findings suggest that modern ASR models possess sufficient internal noise robustness and that traditional speech enhancement may remove acoustic features critical for ASR.

Depending on the brain tumor type, the FLAIR hyperintensity volume is an important measure to asses the tumor volume or surrounding edema, and an automatic segmentation of this would be useful in the clinic. In this study, around 5000 FLAIR images of various tumors types and acquisition time points from different centers were used to train a unified FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation model using an Attention U-Net architecture. The performance was compared against dataset specific models, and was validated on different tumor types, acquisition time points and against BraTS.

While reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offer a low-cost alignment solution, their reliance on sparse, outcome-based rewards inadvertently encourages models to \"overthink\" -- generating verbose, convoluted, and unverifiable Chain-of-Thought reasoning to justify answers. This focus on outcomes obscures factual errors and poses significant safety risks. To address this, we propose CheXPO-v2, a novel alignment framework that shifts from outcome to process supervision. Our core innovation is a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward mechanism driven by Entity-Relation Matching. By explicitly parsing reasoning steps into structured \"Disease, Relation, Anatomy\" triplets, we provide fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level. Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA. Crucially, CheXPO-v2 achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy using only 5k samples, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency while producing clinically sound and verifiable reasoning.

Most existing deep learning based malware detectors rely on closed world assumptions and fail to adequately model this intra class variation, resulting in degraded performance when confronted with previously unseen malware families. This paper presents MADOOD, a novel two stage, cluster driven deep learning framework for robust OOD malware detection and classification. In the first stage, malware family embeddings are modeled using class conditional spherical decision boundaries derived from Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), enabling statistically grounded separation of indistribution and OOD samples without requiring OOD data during training. Z score based distance analysis across multiple class centroids is employed to reliably identify anomalous samples in the latent space. In the second stage, a deep neural network integrates cluster based predictions, refined embeddings, and supervised classifier outputs to enhance final classification accuracy. Extensive evaluations on benchmark malware datasets comprising 25 known families and multiple novel OOD variants demonstrate that MADOOD significantly outperforms state of the art OOD detection methods, achieving an AUC of up to 0.911 on unseen malware families.

LibriVAD enables systematic control over speech-to-noise ratio, silence-to-speech ratio (SSR), and noise diversity, and is released in three sizes (15 GB, 150 GB, and 1.5 TB) with two variants (LibriVAD-NonConcat and LibriVAD-Concat) to support different experimental setups. We benchmark multiple feature-model combinations, including waveform, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and Gammatone filter bank cepstral coefficients, and introduce the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for VAD. Our experiments show that ViT with MFCC features consistently outperforms established VAD models such as boosted deep neural network and convolutional long short-term memory deep neural network across seen, unseen, and out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, including evaluation on the real-world VOiCES dataset. We further analyze the impact of dataset size and SSR on model generalization, experimentally showing that scaling up dataset size and balancing SSR noticeably and consistently enhance VAD performance under OOD conditions. All datasets, trained models, and code are publicly released to foster reproducibility and accelerate progress in VAD research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdLibriVAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u8fdb\u884cVAD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165ViT\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aViT+MFCC\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u548cSSR\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u97f3\u6d3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08VAD\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u58f0\u5b66\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165LibriVAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165ViT\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8eVAD\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548cSSR\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "ViT+MFCC\u7279\u5f81\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709VAD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5e73\u8861SSR\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347OOD\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684VAD\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdbVAD\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Camera-ready version", "summary": "Modern HTTPS mechanisms such as Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) and encrypted DNS improve privacy but remain vulnerable to website fingerprinting (WF) attacks, where adversaries infer visited sites from encrypted traffic patterns. Existing WF methods rely on supervised learning with site-specific labeled traces, which limits scalability and fails to handle previously unseen websites. We address these limitations by reformulating WF as a zero-shot cross-modal retrieval problem and introducing STAR. STAR learns a joint embedding space for encrypted traffic traces and crawl-time logic profiles using a dual-encoder architecture. Trained on 150K automatically collected traffic-logic pairs with contrastive and consistency objectives and structure-aware augmentation, STAR retrieves the most semantically aligned profile for a trace without requiring target-side traffic during training. Experiments on 1,600 unseen websites show that STAR achieves 87.9 percent top-1 accuracy and 0.963 AUC in open-world detection, outperforming supervised and few-shot baselines. Adding an adapter with only four labeled traces per site further boosts top-5 accuracy to 98.8 percent. Our analysis reveals intrinsic semantic-traffic alignment in modern web protocols, identifying semantic leakage as the dominant privacy risk in encrypted HTTPS traffic.

However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling.

A fundamental trade-off arises between the timeliness of the information maintained at the AP and the update cost incurred at the device. To address this trade-off, we propose an online algorithm that determines when to transmit updates using only available observations. The proposed algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal competitive ratio against an adversary that can simultaneously manipulate multiple sources of uncertainty, including the operation duration, the information staleness, the update cost, and the availability of update opportunities. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning (ML) advice of unknown reliability into the design, we develop an ML-augmented algorithm that asymptotically attains the optimal consistency-robustness trade-off, even when the adversary can additionally corrupt the ML advice. The optimal competitive ratio scales linearly with the range of update costs, but is unaffected by other uncertainties. Moreover, an optimal competitive online algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to the ML advice: it either fully trusts or completely ignores the ML advice, as partially trusting the advice cannot improve the consistency without severely degrading the robustness.

To meet this need, we propose the AncientBench, which aims to evaluate the comprehension of ancient characters, especially in the scenario of excavated documents.

Existing deep learning models lack flexibility to handle dynamic network configurations. Furthermore, many approaches overlook pilot contamination and suffer from high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight transformer model that overcomes these limitations by jointly predicting AP clusters and powers solely from spatial coordinates of user devices and AP.

To this end, we propose Pix2NPHM, a vision transformer (ViT) network that directly regresses NPHM parameters, given a single image as input. Compared to existing approaches, the neural parametric space allows our method to reconstruct more recognizable facial geometry and accurate facial expressions. For broad generalization, we exploit domain-specific ViTs as backbones, which are pretrained on geometric prediction tasks. We train Pix2NPHM on a mixture of 3D data, including a total of over 100K NPHM registrations that enable direct supervision in SDF space, and large-scale 2D video datasets, for which normal estimates serve as pseudo ground truth geometry. Pix2NPHM not only allows for 3D reconstructions at interactive frame rates, it is also possible to improve geometric fidelity by a subsequent inference-time optimization against estimated surface normals and canonical point maps.

However, existing efforts focus primarily on increasing dataset size and overlook the question of whether the backbone network is an effective representation learner at scale. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting ConvNeXt-based architectures for volumetric segmentation and introducing MedNeXt-v2, a compound-scaled 3D ConvNeXt that leverages improved micro-architecture and data scaling to deliver state-of-the-art performance. First, we show that routinely used backbones in large-scale pretraining pipelines are often suboptimal. Subsequently, we use comprehensive backbone benchmarking prior to scaling and demonstrate that stronger from scratch performance reliably predicts stronger downstream performance after pretraining. Guided by these findings, we incorporate a 3D Global Response Normalization module and use depth, width, and context scaling to improve our architecture for effective representation learning. We pretrain MedNeXt-v2 on 18k CT volumes and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning across six challenging CT and MR benchmarks (144 structures), showing consistent gains over seven publicly released pretrained models. Beyond improvements, our benchmarking of these models also reveals that stronger backbones yield better results on similar data, representation scaling disproportionately benefits pathological segmentation, and that modality-specific pretraining offers negligible benefit once full finetuning is applied. In conclusion, our results establish MedNeXt-v2 as a strong backbone for large-scale supervised representation learning in 3D Medical Image Segmentation.

Existing methods mainly fall into two categories: (1) static world generation models, which construct 3D environments without active agents, and (2) controllable-entity models, which allow a single entity to perform limited actions in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment.

However, deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices presents significant challenges due to computational and memory limitations. This research investigates a resource-efficient approach to medical image classification by employing model quantization techniques. Quantization reduces the precision of model parameters and activations, significantly lowering computational overhead and memory requirements without sacrificing classification accuracy. The study focuses on the optimization of quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) methods tailored for edge devices, analyzing their impact on model performance across medical imaging datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that quantized models achieve substantial reductions in model size and inference latency, enabling real-time processing on edge hardware while maintaining clinically acceptable diagnostic accuracy.

The depth and context from traditionally qualitative methods such as participant observation, in-depth interviews, and historical documents are increasingly employed alongside scalable data management, computational text analysis, and open-science practices. Machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), provide resources to aggregate and systematically index large volumes of qualitative data, identify patterns, and maintain clear links to in-depth accounts. Drawing on case studies of projects that examine later life--including examples with original data from the DISCERN study (a team-based ethnography of life with dementia) and secondary analyses of the American Voices Project (nationally representative interview)--the chapter highlights both uses and challenges of bringing CSS tools into more meaningful dialogue with qualitative aging research. The chapter argues such work has potential for (1) streamlining and augmenting existing workflows, (2) scaling up samples and projects, and (3) generating multi-method approaches to address important questions in new ways, before turning to practices useful for individuals and teams seeking to understand current possibilities or refine their workflow processes. The chapter concludes that current developments are not without peril, but offer potential for new insights into aging and the life course by broadening--rather than replacing--the methodological foundations of qualitative research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u8ba1\u7b97\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\uff08CSS\uff09\u5de5\u5177\u5982\u4f55\u6269\u5c55\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6848\u4f8b\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8ba1\u7b97\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DISCERN\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u58f0\u9879\u76ee\u7b49\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "CSS\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u7b80\u5316\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u6269\u5927\u6837\u672c\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u751f\u6210\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u53d1\u5c55\u867d\u6709\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u62d3\u5bbd\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u548c\u751f\u547d\u5386\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Adarsh Pritam", "Jeba Shiney O", "Sanyam Jain"], "title": "SkinGenBench: Generative Model and Preprocessing Effects for Synthetic Dermoscopic Augmentation in Melanoma Diagnosis", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "This work introduces SkinGenBench, a systematic biomedical imaging benchmark that investigates how preprocessing complexity interacts with generative model choice for synthetic dermoscopic image augmentation and downstream melanoma diagnosis. Using a curated dataset of 14,116 dermoscopic images from HAM10000 and MILK10K across five lesion classes, we evaluate the two representative generative paradigms: StyleGAN2-ADA and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) under basic geometric augmentation and advanced artifact removal pipelines. Synthetic melanoma images are assessed using established perceptual and distributional metrics (FID, KID, IS), feature space analysis, and their impact on diagnostic performance across five downstream classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that generative architecture choice has a stronger influence on both image fidelity and diagnostic utility than preprocessing complexity. StyleGAN2-ADA consistently produced synthetic images more closely aligned with real data distributions, achieving the lowest FID (~65.5) and KID (~0.05), while diffusion models generated higher variance samples at the cost of reduces perceptual fidelity and class anchoring. Advanced artifact removal yielded only marginal improvements in generative metrics and provided limited downstream diagnostic gains, suggesting possible suppression of clinically relevant texture cues. In contrast, synthetic data augmentation substantially improved melanoma detection with 8-15% absolute gains in melanoma F1-score, and ViT-B/16 achieving F1~0.88 and ROC-AUC~0.98, representing an improvement of approximately 14% over non-augmented baselines.

We present AnyTask, an automated framework that pairs massively parallel GPU simulation with foundation models to design diverse manipulation tasks and synthesize robot data. We introduce three AnyTask agents for generating expert demonstrations aiming to solve as many tasks as possible: 1) ViPR, a novel task and motion planning agent with VLM-in-the-loop Parallel Refinement; 2) ViPR-Eureka, a reinforcement learning agent with generated dense rewards and LLM-guided contact sampling; 3) ViPR-RL, a hybrid planning and learning approach that jointly produces high-quality demonstrations with only sparse rewards. We train behavior cloning policies on generated data, validate them in simulation, and deploy them directly on real robot hardware. The policies generalize to novel object poses, achieving 44% average success across a suite of real-world pick-and-place, drawer opening, contact-rich pushing, and long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Unlike conventional ensembles that often rely on homogeneous architectures, our approach combines architecturally diverse small transformer-based large language models (sLLMs) - BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, and ELECTRA, each fully fine-tuned for emotion classification. To preserve error diversity, we minimize parameter convergence while taking advantage of the unique biases of each model. A dual-weighted voting mechanism integrates both global credibility (validation F1 score) and local confidence (instance-level probability) to dynamically weight model contributions. Experiments on the DAIR-AI dataset demonstrate that our credibility-confidence ensemble achieves a macro F1 score of 93.5 percent, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and significantly outperforming large-scale LLMs, including Falcon, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi, even after task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). With only 595M parameters in total, our small LLMs ensemble proves more parameter-efficient and robust than models up to 7B parameters, establishing that carefully designed ensembles of small, fine-tuned models can outperform much larger LLMs in specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as emotion detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d7\u5b54\u591a\u585e\u966a\u5ba1\u56e2\u5b9a\u7406\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u5c0f\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u8d28\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u7528\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u6536\u655b\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u8bef\u5dee\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAIR - AI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe93.5%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u4ec5595M\uff0c\u6bd47B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u7279\u5b9aNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We use a fully solvable one-dimensional Ising model to show that local basis rotations leave the loss landscape unchanged while relocating the exact wavefunction in parameter space, effectively increasing its geometric distance from typical initializations. By sweeping a rotation angle, we compute quantum Fisher information and Fubini-Study distances to quantify how the rotated wavefunction moves within the loss landscape. Shallow architectures (with focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)) trained with quantum natural gradient are more likely to fall into saddle-point regions depending on the rotation angle: they achieve low energy error but fail to reproduce correct coefficient distributions. In the ferromagnetic case, near-degenerate eigenstates create high-curvature barriers that trap optimization at intermediate fidelities.

Recent video-based approaches have shown great promise in capturing and transferring the temporal and physical interactions by pre-training on Internet-scale video data. However, such methods are often not optimized for the embodiment-specific closed-loop control, typically suffering from high latency and insufficient grounding. In this paper, we present Vidarc (Video Diffusion for Action Reasoning and Closed-loop Control), a novel autoregressive embodied video diffusion approach augmented by a masked inverse dynamics model. By grounding video predictions with action-relevant masks and incorporating real-time feedback through cached autoregressive generation, Vidarc achieves fast, accurate closed-loop control. Pre-trained on one million cross-embodiment episodes, Vidarc surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving at least a 15% higher success rate in real-world deployment and a 91% reduction in latency.

Thus, an adversary could aim to modify an image by adding unseen elements, which will confuse the AI in its recognition of an entity. This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision.

We introduce Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that bridges this domain gap by fusing DA-V2 with the powerful priors of large-scale 2D diffusion models. Our method performs label-free refinement directly on the input image by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting the input. This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder.

Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary.

The goal is to develop machine learning (ML) models to predict pathologic complete response (PCR binary classification) and 5-year relapse-free survival status (RFS binary classification). Method: The proposed framework includes tumour segmentation, image registration, feature extraction, and predictive modelling. Using the image registration method, MRI image features can be extracted and compared from the original tumour site at different time points, therefore monitoring the intratumor changes during NACT process. Four feature extractors, including one radiomics and three deep learning-based (MedicalNet, Segformer3D, SAM-Med3D) were implemented and compared. In combination with three feature selection methods and four ML models, predictive models are built and compared. Results: The proposed image registration-based feature extraction consistently improves the predictive models. In the PCR and RFS classification tasks logistic regression model trained on radiomic features performed the best with an AUC of 0.88 and classification accuracy of 0.85 for PCR classification, and AUC of 0.78 and classification accuracy of 0.72 for RFS classification.

We present a Domain-Aware Quantum Circuit (DAQC) that leverages image priors to guide locality-preserving encoding and entanglement via non-overlapping DCT-style zigzag windows. The design employs interleaved encode-entangle-train cycles, where entanglement is applied among qubits hosting neighboring pixels, aligned to device connectivity. This staged, locality-preserving information flow expands the effective receptive field without deep global mixing, enabling efficient use of limited depth and qubits. The design concentrates representational capacity on short-range correlations, reduces long-range two-qubit operations, and encourages stable optimization, thereby mitigating depth-induced and globally entangled barren-plateau effects. We evaluate DAQC on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and PneumoniaMNIST datasets. On quantum hardware, DAQC achieves performance competitive with strong classical baselines (e.g., ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) and substantially outperforming Quantum Circuit Search (QCS) baselines. To the best of our knowledge, DAQC, which uses a quantum feature extractor with only a linear classical readout (no deep classical backbone), currently achieves the best reported performance on real quantum hardware for QML-based image classification tasks.

Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations. To mitigate this instability, we curate existing datasets to create VPBench, a larger visually prompted benchmark with 16 visual marker variants.

Standard formulations, such as hybrid or SLEVE coordinates, mitigate these errors by using analytic decay functions controlled by heuristic scale parameters that are typically tuned by hand and fixed a priori. In this work, we propose a framework to define a parametric vertical coordinate system as a learnable component within a differentiable dynamical core. We develop an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver for the two-dimensional non-hydrostatic Euler equations on an Arakawa C-grid, and introduce a NEUral Vertical Enhancement (NEUVE) terrain-following coordinate based on an integral transformed neural network that guarantees monotonicity. A key feature of our approach is the use of automatic differentiation to compute exact geometric metric terms, thereby eliminating truncation errors associated with finite-difference coordinate derivatives. By coupling simulation errors through the time integration to the parameterization, our formulation finds a grid structure optimized for both the underlying physics and numerics.
