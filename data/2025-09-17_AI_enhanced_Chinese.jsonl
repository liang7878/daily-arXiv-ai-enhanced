However,\nmodern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands\nsemantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given\nenormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs)\ndemonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to\nunacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \\textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel\nsystem that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline\nrepresentation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline\nphase, \\textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations\nfor each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model\non these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only\nthe ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore,\n\\textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant\nefficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy\nmodel to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade\nmechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific\naccuracy targets.

To alleviate this, Tile\nSpatial Scheduling (TSS) reduces such costs by fragmenting inter-layer data\ninto smaller tiles communicated via on-chip links.However, many emerging\napplications require concurrent execution of multiple DNNs with complex\ntopologies, where critical tasks must preempt others to meet stringent latency\nrequirements (e.g., in autonomous driving, obstacle detection must complete\nwithin tens of milliseconds). Existing TSS works lack support for preemption,\nwhile prior preemption schemes rely on LTS and thus inherit its overheads. This\nhighlights the need for preemptive and efficient TSS-based frameworks.

Despite these\nchanges, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns\nand the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations\ncall for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal\ndynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch\nattributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major\nchallenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive\ncomputational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational\nvalidity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint\ndistribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over\nfeasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,\nleveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at\neach stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for\nstructural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds\ntime-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability\nand sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow\nnot only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also\nachieves a 98.9\\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency\nresilience.

Some results are valid for\nproportional division but not for envy-free division. Here, we introduce and\nstudy a scale between the proportional division and the envy-free division. The\ngoal is to understand where is the gap between statements about proportional\ndivision and envy-free division. This scale comes from the notion introduced in\nthis article: k-proportionality. When k = n this notion corresponds to the\nproportional division and when k = 2 it corresponds to envy-free division. With\nk-proportionality we can understand where some difficulties in fair division\nlie. First, we show that there are situations in which there is no\nk-proportional and equitable division of a pie with connected pieces when k\n$\\le$ n -1.

Next,\nwe prove that there are situations in which there is no Pareto-optimal\nk-proportional division of a cake with connected pieces when k $\\le$ n -1. This\nresult was known only for k = 2.

Current management relies primarily on\naneurysm diameter and growth rate, which may not reliably predict\npatient-specific rupture risk. Computation of AAA wall stress and strain has\nthe potential to improve individualized risk assessment, but these analyses\ndepend on image-derived geometry, which is subject to segmentation uncertainty\nand lacks a definitive ground truth for the wall boundary. While the effect of\ngeometric uncertainty on wall stress has been studied, its influence on wall\nstrain remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the impact of geometric\nuncertainty on AAA wall strain computed using deformable image registration of\ntime-resolved 3D computed tomography angiography (4D-CTA). Controlled\nperturbations were applied to the wall geometry along the surface normal,\nparameterized by the standard deviation for random variation and the mean for\nsystematic inward or outward bias, both scaled relative to wall thickness.\nResults show that uncertainties in AAA wall geometry reduce the accuracy of\ncomputed strain, with inward bias (toward the blood lumen and intraluminal\nthrombus) consistently causing greater deviations than outward bias (toward\nregions external to the aortic wall). Peak strain is more sensitive but less\nrobust, whereas the 99th percentile strain remains more stable under\nperturbations.

Our scheme is\nhowever not restricted to the information retrieval setting, and we demonstrate\nits wider applicability by synthesizing the multi-task leaf-mt model. This also\nsets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its\nsize. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding\nmodel training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives,\nand training can be conducted using small batch sizes. Thus, dataset and\ntraining infrastructure requirements for our framework are modest.

It allows\nLMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential\ncollision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes\nonly the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning\nwhen the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting\n13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited\nparametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive\nphysical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal\nphysical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from\nlanguage bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the\ntrustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u672a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f52\u7eb3\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faInPhyRe\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u6d4b\u91cfLMMs\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0LMMs\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u5dee\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406\u5f31\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u8bc4\u4f30LMMs\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9LMMs\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInPhyRe\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u78b0\u649e\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30LMMs\u9884\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd513\u4e2aLMMs\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cLMMs\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u6f14\u793a\u6837\u672c\u8fdd\u53cd\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u65f6\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u5ffd\u89c6\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "LMMs\u5728\u5f52\u7eb3\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5b58\u7591\u3002"}}

This approach can\neffectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones\nfor better answer generation.

Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance\ngains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange\nstrategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%.

To\naddress these limitations, we proposed DiffHash, a novel diffusion-based\ntargeted attack for deep hashing. Unlike traditional pixel-based attacks that\ndirectly modify specific pixels and lack multimodal guidance, our approach\nfocuses on optimizing the latent representations of images, guided by text\ninformation generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) for the target image.\nFurthermore, we designed a multi-space hash alignment network to align the\nhigh-dimension image space and text space to the low-dimension binary hash\nspace.

To accomplish this,\nwe build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC).\nPARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network\narchitecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical\nfields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as\nthe formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation\nscenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a\nmicrostructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and\nreduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a\nlower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent\nrepresentation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g.\ntemperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced\ndimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the\ninitiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model.

Current spectral learning approaches provide only point\nestimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in\nsafety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential.\nParametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine\nlearning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations.\nHowever, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty\nquantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models\n(B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty\nestimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational\nefficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying\nuncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail\ndue to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical\ncontributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized\nmatrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty\npropagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using\nmanifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian\nconstraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit\ndependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning.

For this reason, in this work, we\npropose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis\nto improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within\ntransactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of\ntraditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled\ninformation that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis.\nTherefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves\n(i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage\nlarge node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying\nautomatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels.

Such deformation\noften originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence\nvary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods\nfor modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are\ncomputationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.\nNeural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently\nsolving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in\naccelerating residual stress-deformation analysis.

To address this challenge, a novel framework based on\ndiffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural\noperator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are\nexplicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural\nnetwork constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is\nthen trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of\ndeformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the\ndiffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient\nprediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The\nproposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient\nsolution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying\ngeometries.

Papillary thyroid cancer\nand follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer.\nFollicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more\ndifficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid\ncancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established.\nWe aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a\nnovel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in\npreoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on\ncase data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University\nThird Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods,\nwe improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and\nproposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between\nclinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in\ninterpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to\ncontain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were\nbenign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition\nto some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven\nthickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong\nmalignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,\nand low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of\nHashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.\nConclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular\nthyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more\naccurate diagnosis.

It has\nbeen recently shown that boundedvariables can achieve the same computational\npower at the expense of extra rounds. However, the exact relationship between\nthe bit capacity of the shared memory and the number of rounds required in\norder to implement one round of the full-information protocol remained unknown.\n  In this paper, we focus on the asymptotic round complexity of bounded\niterated shared-memory algorithms that simulate, up to isomorphism, the\nunbounded full-information protocol. We relate the round complexity to the\nnumber of processes $n$, the number of iterations of the full information\nprotocol $r$, and the bit size per shared-memory entry $b$. By analyzing the\ncorresponding protocol complex, a combinatorial structure representing\nreachable states, we derive necessary conditions and present a bounded\nfull-information algorithm tailored to the bits available $b$ per shared memory\nentry. We show that for $n>2$, the round complexity required to implement the\nfull-information protocol satisfies $\\Omega((n!)^{r-1} \\cdot 2^{n-b})$. Our\nresults apply to a range of iterated shared-memory models, from regular\nread-write registers to atomic and immediate snapshots.

Equipment languages such as the\nAlgorithmic Pattern Generator (ALPG) are critical for precise hardware control\nbut are challenging to program due to their low-level syntax and steep learning\ncurve. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating\nhigh-level code from natural language, their effectiveness on low-level\nequipment languages remains limited. To address this, we propose Progressive\nKnowledge Enhancement (PKE), a novel multi-stage prompting framework that\nprogressively extracts and activates the latent knowledge within LLMs, guiding\nthem from simple to complex examples without extensive fine-tuning.

Researchers must review and filter a large number of\nunstructured sources, which frequently contain sparse information and are\nunlikely to be included in the final study. Our experience conducting an MVLR\non Context-Aware Software Systems (CASS) Testing in the avionics domain\nexemplified this challenge, with over 8,000 highly heterogeneous documents\nrequiring review. Therefore, we developed a Large Language Model (LLM)\nassistant to support the search and filtering of documents. Aims: To develop\nand validate an LLM based tool that can support researchers in performing the\nsearch and filtering of documents for an MVLR without compromising the rigor of\nthe research protocol. Method: We applied sound engineering practices to\ndevelop an on-premises LLM-based tool incorporating Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) to process candidate sources. Progress towards the aim was\nquantified using the Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) as the primary metric to\nensure the performance of the LLM based tool. Convenience sampling, supported\nby human judgment and statistical sampling, were used to verify and validate\nthe tool's quality-in-use. Results: The tool currently demonstrates a PPA\nagreement with human researchers of 90% for sources that are not relevant to\nthe study. Development details are shared to support domain-specific adaptation\nof the tool. Conclusions: Using LLM-based tools to support academic researchers\nin rigorous MVLR is feasible.

This paper proposes a federated learning\nframework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission,\nmodel quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy\nefficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink\ntransmission power to balance energy savings and model performance.

Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this\nstudy aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one\nhour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot.

However, in\ncomputational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation\ntechniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface.\nFurthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each\nother or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to\nsystematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and\npruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead\nto information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the\npotential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high\ndimensionality of atomic descriptors.

To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced\ncontinual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers\nwhat matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential\nPrivacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the\nsemantic sensitivity of individual tokens.

In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning\nalgorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed\nalgorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness\nviolations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound\n(UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to\nage-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last\ntime an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and\nUCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and\nexploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between\nvirtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial\nLyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness\nviolation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our\nproposed algorithm.

The PINNs are trained by minimizing the\nresidual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their\nconfiguration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is\napplied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of\nsolution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.\n  Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of\nintegration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for\nPINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable\nconfigurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs\nproduced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42\ntimes longer than BEM.

Since synthetic data is sent to the server,\nleveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework\nprotects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with\nhigh-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem.

The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like\nhigh-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus\nfiltering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our\nFedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components\nusing a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain\ndistribution alignment.

Recently, time series foundation models\n(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,\nexisting methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,\ncomputing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a\ntask-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection\napproach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,\ncomputing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.\nGiven a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and\npatch-token position that yield the most informative representation.

During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score\nfor incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate\nrepresentations and those of the collection.

We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that\nreplaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically\nprincipled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis\ntesting (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a\ncandidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the\ncomplication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach\nto determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping\ncriterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold\n(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of\nthe simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned\nusing the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply\nremoving nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter\ntuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a\np-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into\nour framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical\nevaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree\nconsistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.\nCompared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing\nperformance.

Two integration strategies are commonly\nconsidered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part\nof the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the\npolicy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical\nrelevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their\ndifferences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of\nSE-RL and SP-RL.

Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on\ncomplex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these\nstudies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to\nmeasure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the\nSB to various image classification tasks.\n  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models\nand their performance across image classification tasks. First, we\ntheoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of\ncomplexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,\nwe propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We\nvalidate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation\nmethods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous\nmeasures.

Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often\nignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for\ngeometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that\nfuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass\ndermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale\napplication of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,\nsynthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets\n(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are\nregressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.\nFrom lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of\ngyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry\nsimilarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs\nsemi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.\nResults. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale\nregression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a\nthresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440\nfor the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99\nrange. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in\na population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on\nISIC-2019.

The primary\nissue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,\ncausing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon\nknown as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can\npartially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and\nover-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data\ndistributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,\nenable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face\nchallenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of\ntasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases\nthe potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical\nAdapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters\nfrom different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale\neffectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with\nimproved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that\nhierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank\nadapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on\nadapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge,\nfacilitating transfer learning between related tasks.

Emerging vision foundation\nmodels such as DINOv2, pretrained on extensive, unlabeled datasets, offer\ngeneralized representations that can potentially alleviate these limitations.\nIn this study, we propose an attention-based global aggregation framework\ntailored specifically for 3D medical image anomaly classification. Leveraging\nthe self-supervised DINOv2 model as a pretrained feature extractor, our method\nprocesses individual 2D axial slices of brain MRIs, assigning adaptive\nslice-level importance weights through a soft attention mechanism. To further\naddress data scarcity, we employ a composite loss function combining supervised\ncontrastive learning with class-variance regularization, enhancing inter-class\nseparability and intra-class consistency. We validate our framework on the ADNI\ndataset and an institutional multi-class headache cohort, demonstrating strong\nanomaly classification performance despite limited data availability and\nsignificant class imbalance.

To overcome these limitations, this paper\nproposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various\nconsistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative\nstrategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different\nconsistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their\ncomputed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution\ntrajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on\nthe proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the\nsolution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of\nsmoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and\nhigh-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the\napplicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation\nscenarios.

However, whether large language models (LLMs) can\naccurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of\nfoods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable\nsimpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate\nwhether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the\nground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber\nand total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,\nmean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean\nabsolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across\nendpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,\nwith energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC\nexceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a\nchain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed\nsolely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values\nfrom 24-hour dietary recalls.

Though existing ARD\napproaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads\nto the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this\nproblem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The\ndivergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and\nrobust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and\n2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to\nperformance deterioration of the robust teacher model.

A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment\nto resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b.

For model tuning, Genome-Factory supports three\napproaches: full-parameter, low-rank adaptation, and adapter-based fine-tuning.\nIt is compatible with a wide range of genomic models. For inference,\nGenome-Factory enables both embedding extraction and DNA sequence generation.\nFor benchmarking, we include two existing benchmarks and provide a flexible\ninterface for users to incorporate additional benchmarks.

To improve accessibility, Genome-Factory\nfeatures both a zero-code command-line interface and a user-friendly web\ninterface.

If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered\ntoward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,\nthen those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over\npublic discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can\nreliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such\nsteering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop\nmethods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt\na previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias\nauditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original\nframework, which does not require access to the internals of the language\nmodel.

While existing benchmarks\ndemonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that\npoorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically\nmaintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets\nartificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable\nanomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of\nsemantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically\npaired with semantically consistent textual descriptions.

Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites\nprovide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a\nspatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep\nlearning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution\nover the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier\nAir-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured\nby clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual\ntemperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature\nvalues at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal\nvariations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface\ntemperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key\nEarth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive\nuncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.\nThe proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature\npixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the\ncontiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping\naccuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach\nstreamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,\nand it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature\nmonitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution.

To ensure an effective and\ncomfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging\ndeformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements\nthroughout the dressing process.

In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system\ncapable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as\nrobustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy\ntrained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to\nfine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal\nfeedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's\nadaptability to arm motions and enhance safety.

Previous methods fail to\neffectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases\ncommonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their\nperformance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way\nto combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor\nsubtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and\nsimplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase\nCECT.

However,\nmedical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,\nlimiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect\nperformance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual\npretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO\nrepresenting the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M\nchest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation\nprotocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines\nand tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.\nWhile prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,\nwe include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a\nmodel's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated\nstructures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for\nfinding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.\nSurprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured\nlabels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured\nsupervision at scale.

Second, whereas LLMs\nuse a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional\nmask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less\neffective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually\ntransition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more\ncomprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard\nnegative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative\nexamples throughout the training process.

In this paper, we\nintroduce \\textit{Content Concretization} (CC), a novel jailbreaking technique\nthat iteratively transforms abstract malicious requests into concrete,\nexecutable implementations. CC is a two-stage process: first, generating\ninitial LLM responses using lower-tier, less constrained safety filters models,\nthen refining them through higher-tier models that process both the preliminary\noutput and original prompt. We evaluate our technique using 350\ncybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in\njailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\\% (no refinements) to 62\\%\nafter three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\\textcent~per\nprompt.

During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling\n(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level\nrepresentations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis\nfor subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates\na Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to\ncapture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize\ndependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance\nintra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough\ntoken refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic\nconsistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation\nPenalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that\nBATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and\nimproves the few-shot classification via transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBATR - FST\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3ViTs\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "ViTs\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7ec6\u5316token\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5efa\u7acb\u5f3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684BATR - FST\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7528MIM\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684patch\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5143\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94token\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u56fetoken\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u7c7b\u5206\u79bb\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76841 - shot\u548c5 - shot\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u8d8a\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "BATR - FST\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

SIRENs Sitzmann\net al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting\nsignals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the\nnetwork's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral\nbottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero\noutput and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its\nrepresentational capacity.

WINNER perturbs uniformly\ninitialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are\nadaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to\nrandom Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without\nintroducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape\nfitting tasks over base SIREN.

We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine\ntuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that\nare prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of\nsynthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a\nhighly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is\ninfeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small\nlanguage models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,\nsecurity operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various\nindustries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d77\u4e8b\u60c5\u62a5\u6210\u672c261\u500d\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1aAI\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u505a\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c0632\u4ebf\u6761\u8239\u8236\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bb0\u5f55\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a21,543\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03Qwen2.5 - 7B\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Qwen2.5 - 7B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d77\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe75%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5f53\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u6602\u8d35\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Recent advances\nin diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality\ntabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive\ninformation. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by\ndetermining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied\nin images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains\nunderexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited\nrecord diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference\nAttack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack\nspecifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs\nerrorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target\nrecords, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are\npredicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the\ngenerative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to\ngeneralize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate\nMIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up\nto 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST\n2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box\nMulti-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%).

Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the\nslow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient\nmodels are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission\nof redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)\nframework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis.

This paper introduces a\ncontrastive learning framework for musical instrument retrieval, enabling\ndirect querying of instrument databases using a single model for both single-\nand multi-instrument sounds. We propose techniques to generate realistic\npositive/negative pairs of sounds for virtual musical instruments, such as\nsamplers and synthesizers, addressing limitations in common audio data\naugmentation methods.\n  The first experiment focuses on instrument retrieval from a dataset of 3,884\ninstruments, using single-instrument audio as input. Contrastive approaches are\ncompetitive with previous works based on classification pre-training. The\nsecond experiment considers multi-instrument retrieval with a mixture of\ninstruments as audio input. In this case, the proposed contrastive framework\noutperforms related works, achieving 81.7\\% top-1 and 95.7\\% top-5 accuracies\nfor three-instrument mixtures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u4e50\u5668\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u5355\u4e50\u5668\u548c\u591a\u4e50\u5668\u58f0\u97f3\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u5b57\u97f3\u4e50\u5236\u4f5c\u4e2d\u4ece\u97f3\u9891\u6df7\u5408\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u7d22\u7279\u5b9a\u4e50\u5668\u97f3\u8272\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u4e50\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u8d1f\u58f0\u97f3\u5bf9\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u4e50\u5668\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e50\u5668\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e09\u4e50\u5668\u6df7\u5408\u7684top - 1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe81.7%\uff0ctop - 5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe95.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e50\u5668\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e50\u5668\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}
