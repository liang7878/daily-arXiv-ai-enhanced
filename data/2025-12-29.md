### [1] [From Visual Perception to Deep Empathy: An Automated Assessment Framework for House-Tree-Person Drawings Using Multimodal LLMs and Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21360)
*Shuide Wen,Yu Sun,Beier Ku,Zhi Gao,Lijun Ma,Yang Yang,Can Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究多模态大模型用于房树人测试的潜力，实验证明其有较高语义相似度，多智能体框架提供新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 房树人测试存在评分标准不统一、依赖主观经验和缺乏统一量化编码系统等问题，需要标准化工具。

Method: 进行定量实验计算多模态大语言模型解释与人类专家解释的语义相似度，开展定性分析评估多智能体系统效果。

Result: 定量实验显示两者平均语义相似度约0.75，结构化数据集达0.85；定性分析表明多智能体系统可纠正视觉幻觉，生成的报告生态效度和内部一致性高。

Conclusion: 多模态大模型可作为投射评估的标准化工具，多智能体框架为数字心理健康服务提供新范式。

Abstract: Background: The House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test, introduced by John Buck in 1948, remains a widely used projective technique in clinical psychology. However, it has long faced challenges such as heterogeneous scoring standards, reliance on examiners subjective experience, and a lack of a unified quantitative coding system.
  Results: Quantitative experiments showed that the mean semantic similarity between Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) interpretations and human expert interpretations was approximately 0.75 (standard deviation about 0.05). In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that the multi-agent system, by integrating social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, effectively corrected visual hallucinations and produced psychological reports with high ecological validity and internal coherence.
  Conclusions: The findings confirm the potential of multimodal large models as standardized tools for projective assessment. The proposed multi-agent framework, by dividing roles, decouples feature recognition from psychological inference and offers a new paradigm for digital mental-health services.
  Keywords: House-Tree-Person test; multimodal large language model; multi-agent collaboration; cosine similarity; computational psychology; artificial intelligence

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析计算机围棋求解器解决围棋死活问题的行为。

Method: 使用相关区域搜索（RZS）和相关区域模式表，对《死活字典》中7个死活问题的求解结果进行研究。

Result: 求解器能识别关键区域、发现系列模式（含罕见模式），对两个问题给出不同答案；求解器存在误判罕见模式价值、倾向直接活棋而非最大化地盘两个问题。

Conclusion: 指出求解器存在的问题，并表示未来工作中会探讨解决方法。

Abstract: This paper analyzes the behavior of solving Life-and-Death (L&D) problems in the game of Go using current state-of-the-art computer Go solvers with two techniques: the Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) and the relevance-zone pattern table. We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book "Life and Death Dictionary" written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work. Our code and data are available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/study-LD-RZ.

### [3] [Three-way conflict analysis based on alliance and conflict functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21419)
*Junfang Luo,Mengjun Hu,Guangming Lang,Xin Yang,Keyun Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究三向冲突分析中的三分问题，将辅助函数分离为联盟和冲突函数并应用于冲突分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于评级或辅助函数的研究在解释聚合结果时存在挑战，为澄清语义开展研究。

Method: 将辅助函数中的两个相反方面分离为一对联盟和冲突函数，对主体、问题和主体对进行三分。

Result: 对主体、问题和主体对进行了三分，并探索了联盟集和策略等概念，给出了实际应用案例。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型有助于解决冲突分析中的关键问题。

Abstract: Trisecting agents, issues, and agent pairs are essential topics of three-way conflict analysis. They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function. A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues. An auxiliary function defines the alliance, conflict, and neutrality relations between agents. These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents. For example, when studying agent relations regarding a set of issues, a standard aggregation takes the average of an auxiliary function concerning single issues. Therefore, a pair of alliance +1 and conflict -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions. Accordingly, we trisect the agents, issues, and agent pairs and investigate their applications in solving a few crucial questions in conflict analysis. Particularly, we explore the concepts of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application is given to illustrate the proposed models.

Conclusion: 所提冲突解决模型将加权代理 - 问题评估与一致性和非一致性度量相结合，能系统地识别可行策略和最优解。

Abstract: Most existing work on three-way conflict analysis has focused on trisecting agent pairs, agents, or issues, which contributes to understanding the nature of conflicts but falls short in addressing their resolution. Specifically, the formulation of feasible strategies, as an essential component of conflict resolution and mitigation, has received insufficient scholarly attention. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate feasible strategies from two perspectives of consistency and non-consistency. Particularly, we begin with computing the overall rating of a clique of agents based on positive and negative similarity degrees. Afterwards, considering the weights of both agents and issues, we propose weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, which are respectively used to identify the feasible strategies for a clique of agents. Algorithms are developed to identify feasible strategies, $L$-order feasible strategies, and the corresponding optimal ones. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed models, we apply them to two commonly used case studies on NBA labor negotiations and development plans for Gansu Province and conduct a sensitivity analysis on parameters and a comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art conflict analysis approaches. The comparison results demonstrate that our conflict resolution models outperform the conventional approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency and non-consistency measures to enable the systematic identification of not only feasible strategies but also optimal solutions.

*Junfang Luo,Mengjun Hu,Keyun Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文回顾两种完备信息三元决策方法，将其推广至不完备信息场景，提出新度量及方法，指出新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中不完备信息更常见，已有的完备信息三元决策方法需拓展。

Method: 计算形式：提出对象相似度度量，讨论两种三元决策方法；概念形式：提出公式可满足度度量，研究两种三元决策方法。

Result: 成功将两种完备信息三元决策方法推广到不完备信息场景。

Conclusion: 所提近似度概念和概念形式中的两种方法指出了新的有前景的方向。

Abstract: Three-way decision is widely applied with rough set theory to learn classification or decision rules. The approaches dealing with complete information are well established in the literature, including the two complementary computational and conceptual formulations. The computational formulation uses equivalence relations, and the conceptual formulation uses satisfiability of logic formulas. In this paper, based on a briefly review of these two formulations, we generalize both formulations into three-way decision with incomplete information that is more practical in real-world applications. For the computational formulation, we propose a new measure of similarity degree of objects as a generalization of equivalence relations. Based on it, we discuss two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-similarity classes and approximability of objects, respectively. For the conceptual formulation, we propose a measure of satisfiability degree of formulas as a quantitative generalization of satisfiability with complete information. Based on it, we study two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-meaning sets of formulas and confidence of formulas, respectively. While using similarity classes is a common method of analyzing incomplete information in the literature, the proposed concept of approximability and the two approaches in conceptual formulation point out new promising directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对文本伪造分析现存问题，提出LogicLens框架，结合CCT机制和加权多任务奖励函数，设计PR$^2$ 管道与构建RealText数据集，实验证明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本伪造分析方法多为粗粒度视觉分析，缺乏复杂推理能力，且将检测、定位和解释视为离散子任务，忽视内在联系，AIGC推动下的复杂文本伪造对社会安全和信息真实性构成威胁。

Method: 引入LogicLens统一框架，用Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) 机制进行深度推理，提出加权多任务奖励函数优化。设计PR$^2$ 管道与构建RealText数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明LogicLens在多个基准测试中表现优越，在T - IC13的零样本评估中宏观平均F1分数超过专业框架41.4%、GPT - 4o 23.4%；在T - SROIE数据集上，在mF1、CSS和宏观平均F1方面领先其他基于MLLM的方法。

Conclusion: LogicLens框架能有效解决现有文本伪造分析方法的问题，数据集、模型和代码将公开。

Abstract: Sophisticated text-centric forgeries, fueled by rapid AIGC advancements, pose a significant threat to societal security and information authenticity. Current methods for text-centric forgery analysis are often limited to coarse-grained visual analysis and lack the capacity for sophisticated reasoning. Moreover, they typically treat detection, grounding, and explanation as discrete sub-tasks, overlooking their intrinsic relationships for holistic performance enhancement. To address these challenges, we introduce LogicLens, a unified framework for Visual-Textual Co-reasoning that reformulates these objectives into a joint task. The deep reasoning of LogicLens is powered by our novel Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism, which iteratively cross-validates visual cues against textual logic. To ensure robust alignment across all tasks, we further propose a weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization. Complementing this framework, we first designed the PR$^2$ (Perceiver, Reasoner, Reviewer) pipeline, a hierarchical and iterative multi-agent system that generates high-quality, cognitively-aligned annotations. Then, we constructed RealText, a diverse dataset comprising 5,397 images with fine-grained annotations, including textual explanations, pixel-level segmentation, and authenticity labels for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LogicLens across multiple benchmarks. In a zero-shot evaluation on T-IC13, it surpasses the specialized framework by 41.4% and GPT-4o by 23.4% in macro-average F1 score. Moreover, on the challenging dense-text T-SROIE dataset, it establishes a significant lead over other MLLM-based methods in mF1, CSS, and the macro-average F1. Our dataset, model, and code will be made publicly available.

### [7] [Leash: Adaptive Length Penalty and Reward Shaping for Efficient Large Reasoning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21540)
*Yanhao Li,Lu Ma,Jiaran Zhang,Lexiang Tang,Wentao Zhang,Guibo Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Leash框架解决大语言模型推理长度控制问题，减少平均推理长度且保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定长度惩罚方法难调整，无法适应大语言模型推理能力变化，导致准确性和简洁性权衡不佳。

Method: 将长度控制表述为约束优化问题，采用拉格朗日原始 - 对偶方法动态调整惩罚系数。

Result: 在Deepseek - R1 - Distill - Qwen - 1.5B和Qwen3 - 4B - Thinking - 2507上实验，Leash使不同任务平均推理长度减少60%，且保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出了一个平衡推理能力和计算预算，开发可控高效大语言模型的实用有效范式。

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on fixed length penalties, but such penalties are hard to tune and fail to adapt to the evolving reasoning abilities of LLMs, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and conciseness. To address this challenge, we propose Leash (adaptive LEngth penAlty and reward SHaping), a reinforcement learning framework for efficient reasoning in LLMs. We formulate length control as a constrained optimization problem and employ a Lagrangian primal-dual method to dynamically adjust the penalty coefficient. When generations exceed the target length, the penalty is intensified; when they are shorter, it is relaxed. This adaptive mechanism guides models toward producing concise reasoning without sacrificing task performance. Experiments on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 show that Leash reduces the average reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks - including in-distribution mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution domains such as coding and instruction following - while maintaining competitive performance. Our work thus presents a practical and effective paradigm for developing controllable and efficient LLMs that balance reasoning capabilities with computational budgets.

Abstract: We present the development and optimization of PayPal's Commerce Agent, powered by NEMO-4-PAYPAL, a multi-agent system designed to revolutionize agentic commerce on the PayPal platform. Through our strategic partnership with NVIDIA, we leveraged the NeMo Framework for LLM model fine-tuning to enhance agent performance. Specifically, we optimized the Search and Discovery agent by replacing our base model with a fine-tuned Nemotron small language model (SLM).
  We conducted comprehensive experiments using the llama3.1-nemotron-nano-8B-v1 architecture, training LoRA-based models through systematic hyperparameter sweeps across learning rates, optimizers (Adam, AdamW), cosine annealing schedules, and LoRA ranks. Our contributions include: (1) the first application of NVIDIA's NeMo Framework to commerce-specific agent optimization, (2) LLM powered fine-tuning strategy for retrieval-focused commerce tasks, (3) demonstration of significant improvements in latency and cost while maintaining agent quality, and (4) a scalable framework for multi-agent system optimization in production e-commerce environments. Our results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Nemotron SLM effectively resolves the key performance issue in the retrieval component, which represents over 50\% of total agent response time, while maintaining or enhancing overall system performance.

<details>

Motivation: 现有多模态模型在医学应用中简单整合临床文本和医学影像不能保证可靠推理，且常产生幻觉或思维链不一致问题，限制临床信任。

Method: 提出基于LLaVA的诊断框架，系统包含输入编码器、投影模块、推理控制器和逻辑树生成器。

Result: 在MedXpertQA等基准测试中，该方法提升了多模态任务的诊断准确性，产生更具可解释性的推理痕迹，在仅文本设置中也有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法是迈向可信多模态医学AI的有前景一步。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine, simply integrating clinical text and medical imaging does not guarantee reliable reasoning. Existing multimodal models often produce hallucinations or inconsistent chains of thought, limiting clinical trust. We propose a diagnostic framework built upon LLaVA that combines vision-language alignment with logic-regularized reasoning. The system includes an input encoder for text and images, a projection module for cross-modal alignment, a reasoning controller that decomposes diagnostic tasks into steps, and a logic tree generator that assembles stepwise premises into verifiable conclusions. Evaluations on MedXpertQA and other benchmarks show that our method improves diagnostic accuracy and yields more interpretable reasoning traces on multimodal tasks, while remaining competitive on text-only settings. These results suggest a promising step toward trustworthy multimodal medical AI.

Conclusion: 这是首次报道的大语言模型代理完成非平凡子任务且输出直接用于芯片的人机协作模拟和混合信号集成电路设计。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AMS-IO-Agent, a domain-specialized LLM-based agent for structure-aware input/output (I/O) subsystem generation in analog and mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs). The central contribution of this work is a framework that connects natural language design intent with industrial-level AMS IC design deliverables. AMS-IO-Agent integrates two key capabilities: (1) a structured domain knowledge base that captures reusable constraints and design conventions; (2) design intent structuring, which converts ambiguous user intent into verifiable logic steps using JSON and Python as intermediate formats. We further introduce AMS-IO-Bench, a benchmark for wirebond-packaged AMS I/O ring automation. On this benchmark, AMS-IO-Agent achieves over 70\% DRC+LVS pass rate and reduces design turnaround time from hours to minutes, outperforming the baseline LLM. Furthermore, an agent-generated I/O ring was fabricated and validated in a 28 nm CMOS tape-out, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of the approach in real AMS IC design flows. To our knowledge, this is the first reported human-agent collaborative AMS IC design in which an LLM-based agent completes a nontrivial subtask with outputs directly used in silicon.

Conclusion: OrchestRA将自主执行与人类指导无缝结合，实现了治疗设计的民主化，将药物发现变成可编程的基于证据的工程学科

Abstract: Therapeutic discovery remains a formidable challenge, impeded by the fragmentation of specialized domains and the execution gap between computational design and physiological validation. Although generative AI offers promise, current models often function as passive assistants rather than as autonomous executors. Here, we introduce OrchestRA, a human-in-the-loop multi-agent platform that unifies biology, chemistry, and pharmacology into an autonomous discovery engine. Unlike static code generators, our agents actively execute simulations and reason the results to drive iterative optimization. Governed by an Orchestrator, a Biologist Agent leverages deep reasoning over a massive knowledge graph (>10 million associations) to pinpoint high-confidence targets; a Chemist Agent autonomously detects structural pockets for de novo design or drug repositioning; and a Pharmacologist Agent evaluates candidates via rigorous physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations. This architecture establishes a dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles directly trigger structural reoptimization. By seamlessly integrating autonomous execution with human guidance, OrchestRA democratizes therapeutic design, transforming drug discovery from a stochastic search to a programmable evidence-based engineering discipline.

Result: 证明了实例无关和实例相关的后悔下界，设计的算法有匹配下界的后悔上界。

Conclusion: 解决了优先资源共享机制下非线性组合效用函数优化和学习的技术挑战。

Abstract: This paper proposes a variant of multiple-play stochastic bandits tailored to resource allocation problems arising from LLM applications, edge intelligence, etc. The model is composed of $M$ arms and $K$ plays. Each arm has a stochastic number of capacities, and each unit of capacity is associated with a reward function. Each play is associated with a priority weight. When multiple plays compete for the arm capacity, the arm capacity is allocated in a larger priority weight first manner. Instance independent and instance dependent regret lower bounds of $Ω( α_1 σ\sqrt{KM T} )$ and $Ω(α_1 σ^2 \frac{M}Δ \ln T)$ are proved, where $α_1$ is the largest priority weight and $σ$ characterizes the reward tail. When model parameters are given, we design an algorithm named \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} to locate the optimal play allocation policy with a computational complexity of $O(MK^3)$. Utilizing \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} as a subroutine, an approximate upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm is designed, which has instance independent and instance dependent regret upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bound up to factors of $ \sqrt{K \ln KT }$ and $α_1 K^2$ respectively. To this end, we address nontrivial technical challenges arising from optimizing and learning under a special nonlinear combinatorial utility function induced by the prioritized resource sharing mechanism.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks through the coordination of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), tools, and external services. While these systems enable powerful new capabilities, increasing autonomy introduces critical challenges related to explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence downstream actions or decisions. Existing agentic AI implementations often emphasize functionality and scalability, yet provide limited mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions. This paper presents a Responsible(RAI) and Explainable(XAI) AI Agent Architecture for production-grade agentic workflows based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. In the proposed design, a consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generates candidate outputs from a shared input context, explicitly exposing uncertainty, disagreement, and alternative interpretations. A dedicated reasoning agent then performs structured consolidation across these outputs, enforcing safety and policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations and bias, and producing auditable, evidence-backed decisions. Explainability is achieved through explicit cross-model comparison and preserved intermediate outputs, while responsibility is enforced through centralized reasoning-layer control and agent-level constraints. We evaluate the architecture across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows, demonstrating that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains. This work provides practical guidance for designing agentic AI systems that are autonomous and scalable, yet responsible and explainable by construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI数据集数据收集方式缺乏透明和规范，现有文献多关注模型开发应用，忽略数据集创建的伦理与法律问题，且数据集分享过程中信息易丢失。

Method: 引入合规评级方案（CRS）框架，并基于数据来源技术开发开源Python库，以评估数据集合规性并集成到现有管道中。

Result: 开发出可同时评估现有数据集及指导新数据集构建的开源Python库。

Conclusion: 该库既能评估现有数据集合规性，也能指导新数据集的负责任抓取与构建。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has experienced exponential growth in recent years, partly facilitated by the abundance of large-scale open-source datasets. These datasets are often built using unrestricted and opaque data collection practices. While most literature focuses on the development and applications of GAI models, the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the creation of these datasets are often neglected. In addition, as datasets are shared, edited, and further reproduced online, information about their origin, legitimacy, and safety often gets lost. To address this gap, we introduce the Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS), a framework designed to evaluate dataset compliance with critical transparency, accountability, and security principles. We also release an open-source Python library built around data provenance technology to implement this framework, allowing for seamless integration into existing dataset-processing and AI training pipelines. The library is simultaneously reactive and proactive, as in addition to evaluating the CRS of existing datasets, it equally informs responsible scraping and construction of new datasets.

Result: 在抗生素设计、无机材料设计等多种应用中展示了该框架，证明自动制定目标可显著提高科学发现代理的有效性。

Conclusion: 自动设计目标函数对科学发现代理至关重要，SAGA能有效解决这一挑战。

Abstract: There has been unprecedented interest in developing agents that expand the boundary of scientific discovery, primarily by optimizing quantitative objective functions specified by scientists. However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.

Method: 引入SpatialBench基准，包含146个来自实际空间分析工作流程的可验证问题、实验数据快照和评估关键生物学结果恢复情况的评估器。

Conclusion: SpatialBench可作为测量和诊断工具，用于开发能忠实、透明、可重现地处理真实空间数据集的智能体。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics assays are rapidly increasing in scale and complexity, making computational analysis a major bottleneck in biological discovery. Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world spatial datasets. We introduce SpatialBench, a benchmark of 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows spanning five spatial technologies and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects. SpatialBench serves both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.

Conclusion: 提出的将剪枝视为均衡现象的方法是一种可解释、有理论依据的替代现有剪枝方法的方案。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is widely used to reduce model size and computational cost. Yet, most existing methods treat sparsity as an externally imposed constraint, enforced through heuristic importance scores or training-time regularization. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different perspective: pruning as an equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components. We model parameter groups such as weights, neurons, or filters as players in a continuous non-cooperative game, where each player selects its level of participation in the network to balance contribution against redundancy and competition. Within this formulation, sparsity emerges naturally when continued participation becomes a dominated strategy at equilibrium. We analyze the resulting game and show that dominated players collapse to zero participation under mild conditions, providing a principled explanation for pruning behavior. Building on this insight, we derive a simple equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm that jointly updates network parameters and participation variables without relying on explicit importance scores. This work focuses on establishing a principled formulation and empirical validation of pruning as an equilibrium phenomenon, rather than exhaustive architectural or large-scale benchmarking. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs while offering an interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to existing pruning methods.

Conclusion: UniLabOS为支持智能体、可重复且可溯源的自主实验建立了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Autonomous laboratories promise to accelerate discovery by coupling learning algorithms with robotic experimentation, yet adoption remains limited by fragmented software that separates high-level planning from low-level execution. Here we present UniLabOS, an AI-native operating system for autonomous laboratories that bridges digital decision-making and embodied experimentation through typed, stateful abstractions and transactional safeguards. UniLabOS unifies laboratory elements via an Action/Resource/Action&Resource (A/R/A&R) model, represents laboratory structure with a dual-topology of logical ownership and physical connectivity, and reconciles digital state with material motion using a transactional CRUTD protocol. Built on a distributed edge-cloud architecture with decentralized discovery, UniLabOS enables protocol mobility across reconfigurable topologies while supporting human-in-the-loop governance. We demonstrate the system in four real-world settings -- a liquid-handling workstation, a modular organic synthesis platform, a distributed electrolyte foundry, and a decentralized computation-intensive closed-loop system -- showing robust orchestration across heterogeneous instruments and multi-node coordination. UniLabOS establishes a scalable foundation for agent-ready, reproducible, and provenance-aware autonomous experimentation.

Motivation: 传统ETF选股方法和A3C模型存在高维特征空间和过拟合问题，静态聚类算法无法捕捉市场变化，需要改进。

Method: 提出集成时间序列动态聚类的量子增强A3C框架Q - A3C2，在策略网络中嵌入变分量子电路。

Result: 在标普500成分股实验中，Q - A3C2累积回报率达17.09%，高于基准的7.09%。

Conclusion: Q - A3C2在动态金融环境中有更好的适应性和探索能力。

Abstract: Traditional ETF stock selection methods and reinforcement learning models such as the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) often suffer from high-dimensional feature spaces and overfitting when applied to complex financial markets. Moreover, static clustering algorithms fail to capture evolving market regimes, as the cluster with higher returns in one period may not remain optimal in the next. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Q-A3C2, a quantum-enhanced A3C framework that integrates time-series dynamic clustering. By embedding Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) into the policy network, Q-A3C2 enhances nonlinear feature representation and enables adaptive decision-making at the cluster level. Experimental results on the S and P 500 constituents show that Q-A3C2 achieves a cumulative return of 17.09%, outperforming the benchmark's 7.09%, demonstrating superior adaptability and exploration in dynamic financial environments.

Motivation: 在等参数计数和伴随微分设置下，对量子序列模型QLSTM和QFWP在一维时间序列预测中的性能进行比较研究。

Method: 在10个随机种子和4到64的批量大小下，测量训练前向、反向、全训练和推理的运行时间，以及RMSE和方向准确率等指标。

Result: 批量前向扩展约2.2 - 2.4倍，反向扩展有限；QFWP在各批量大小下RMSE更低、方向准确率更高，QLSTM在批量大小64时吞吐量最高。

Conclusion: 提供了等参数计数对齐、数值检查的基准管道和批量大小选择的实用指导，未来可研究更广泛的数据集、硬件和噪声设置。

Abstract: We compare two quantum sequence models, QLSTM and QFWP, under an Equal Parameter Count (EPC) and adjoint differentiation setup on daily EUR USD forecasting as a controlled one dimensional time series case study. Across 10 random seeds and batch sizes from 4 to 64, we measure component wise runtimes including train forward, backward, full train, and inference, as well as accuracy including RMSE and directional accuracy. Batched forward scales well by about 2.2 to 2.4 times, but backward scales modestly, with QLSTM about 1.01 to 1.05 times and QFWP about 1.18 to 1.22 times, which caps end to end training speedups near 2 times. QFWP achieves lower RMSE and higher directional accuracy at all batch sizes, supported by a Wilcoxon test with p less than or equal to 0.004 and a large Cliff delta, while QLSTM reaches the highest throughput at batch size 64, revealing a clear speed accuracy Pareto frontier. We provide an EPC aligned, numerically checked benchmarking pipeline and practical guidance on batch size choices, while broader datasets and hardware and noise settings are left for future work.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出Query Carefully管线结合LLM生成SQL与处理不可回答输入，构建OncoMX - NAQ评估集，评估多种指标，在不同数据集有不同表现，有轻量级界面助力生物医学文本转SQL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本转SQL系统对模糊、越界或不可回答查询生成可执行SQL有被误判风险，生物医学领域对精度要求高，需解决该问题。

Method: 构建OncoMX - NAQ评估集，用llama3.3:70b结合模式感知提示、无答案规则和少量样本示例，评估多个指标。

Result: 在OncoMX开发集，少量可回答样本提示提高结果准确率，添加不可回答样本不降低性能；OncoMX - NAQ上平衡提示不可回答检测准确率最高，不同类型查询表现有差异。

Conclusion: 轻量级界面支持生物医学应用中透明可靠的文本转SQL。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems allow non-SQL experts to interact with relational databases using natural language. However, their tendency to generate executable SQL for ambiguous, out-of-scope, or unanswerable queries introduces a hidden risk, as outputs may be misinterpreted as correct. This risk is especially serious in biomedical contexts, where precision is critical. We therefore present Query Carefully, a pipeline that integrates LLM-based SQL generation with explicit detection and handling of unanswerable inputs. Building on the OncoMX component of ScienceBenchmark, we construct OncoMX-NAQ (No-Answer Questions), a set of 80 no-answer questions spanning 8 categories (non-SQL, out-of-schema/domain, and multiple ambiguity types). Our approach employs llama3.3:70b with schema-aware prompts, explicit No-Answer Rules (NAR), and few-shot examples drawn from both answerable and unanswerable questions. We evaluate SQL exact match, result accuracy, and unanswerable-detection accuracy. On the OncoMX dev split, few-shot prompting with answerable examples increases result accuracy, and adding unanswerable examples does not degrade performance. On OncoMX-NAQ, balanced prompting achieves the highest unanswerable-detection accuracy (0.8), with near-perfect results for structurally defined categories (non-SQL, missing columns, out-of-domain) but persistent challenges for missing-value queries (0.5) and column ambiguity (0.3). A lightweight user interface surfaces interim SQL, execution results, and abstentions, supporting transparent and reliable text-to-SQL in biomedical applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出开源库MpGEMM利用ARM SME架构特性优化多精度GEMM，在Apple M4 Pro上测试有速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代架构如ARM SME虽有矩阵运算硬件，但现有线性代数库未充分挖掘其对大矩阵的运算潜力。

Method: 系统分析SME架构得出优化准则；采用缓存感知分区、实时转置的数据打包方法和利用多向量加载及所有可用Tile寄存器的微内核。

Result: 在Apple M4 Pro上对DeepSeek和LLaMA实际工作负载测试，MpGEMM较苹果优化的Apple Accelerate库平均加速1.23倍，远超其他开源库。

Conclusion: MpGEMM能有效利用SME架构特性优化GEMM运算。

Abstract: General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is a critical kernel in high-performance computing and deep learning. While modern architectures like ARM's Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) introduce dedicated hardware for matrix operations, existing linear algebra libraries fail to fully exploit its potential, particularly for large matrices. This paper presents MpGEMM, an open-source library that leverages key architectural features of SME to optimize GEMM across multiple precisions. Through a systematic characterization of SME, we derive optimization guidelines that inform our design. MpGEMM employs cache-aware partitioning, efficient data packing with on-the-fly transposition, and specialized micro-kernels that utilize multi-vector loads and all available tile registers. Evaluated on an Apple M4 Pro with real-world workloads from DeepSeek and LLaMA, MpGEMM achieves an average speedup of 1.23x over the vendor-optimized Apple Accelerate library and significantly outperforms other open-source alternatives.

TL;DR: 提出FinDEP优化混合专家架构推理吞吐量，在多GPU系统实验中效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合专家（MoE）架构推理耗内存，现有分离式专家并行（DEP）缺共享专家支持和高效任务调度。

Method: 提出FinDEP算法，包括将计算/通信分小任务、制定调度优化方案和开发搜索空间高效求解器。

Result: 在四个GPU系统用DeepSeek - V2和Qwen3 - MoE实验，FinDEP比先前方法提升吞吐量达1.61倍，在32 - GPU系统加速达1.24倍。

Conclusion: FinDEP能提高MoE推理吞吐量，有较好性能提升。

Abstract: The mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture scales model size with sublinear computational increase but suffers from memory-intensive inference due to KV caches and sparse expert activation. Recent disaggregated expert parallelism (DEP) distributes attention and experts to dedicated GPU groups but lacks support for shared experts and efficient task scheduling, limiting performance.
  We propose FinDEP, a fine-grained task scheduling algorithm for DEP that maximizes task overlap to improve MoE inference throughput. FinDEP introduces three innovations: 1) partitioning computation/communication into smaller tasks for fine-grained pipelining, 2) formulating a scheduling optimization supporting variable granularity and ordering, and 3) developing an efficient solver for this large search space.
  Experiments on four GPU systems with DeepSeek-V2 and Qwen3-MoE show FinDEP improves throughput by up to 1.61x over prior methods, achieving up to 1.24x speedup on a 32-GPU system.

TL;DR: 提出TC加速框架BLEST用于BFS，通过多种策略优化，实验显示比其他方法有显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU的MMA单元针对密集操作，难以用于不规则图计算，需要高效映射BFS边缘操作到TC并避免冗余、负载不平衡和同步问题。

Method: 围绕位图结构和执行布局重新设计拉式BFS管道，引入BVSS实现负载均衡，应用两种图重排序策略，开发批量SpMSpV乘法模式，结合内核融合和懒顶点更新方案。

Result: 在大量真实图上，BLEST比BerryBees、Gunrock和GSWITCH分别平均提速3.58倍、4.64倍和4.9倍。

Conclusion: BLEST能有效利用GPU的TC单元加速BFS，在实际图计算中表现出色。

Abstract: Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph kernel that underpins a wide range of applications. While modern GPUs provide specialised Matrix-Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) units, e.g., Tensor Cores (TC), with extremely high throughput, they target dense operations, making it non-trivial to exploit them for irregular, unstructured graph computations. In particular, fully utilising them for a BFS requires an efficient mapping of the edge operations onto TCs while avoiding redundancy, load imbalance, and synchronisation. We present BLEST, a TC-accelerated framework that reformulates the pull-based BFS pipeline around a bitmap-oriented structure and a carefully engineered execution layout. BLEST introduces Binarised Virtual Slice Sets (BVSS) to enforce warp-level load balancing and to eliminate frontier-oblivious work assignment. To improve both memory efficiency and update locality across diverse graphs, we apply two complementary graph reordering strategies: a compression-oriented ordering for social-like graphs and a bandwidth-reducing ordering for non-social graphs. At the compute level, we develop a batched SpMSpV multiplication pattern that uses the bitwise TC tiles to handle dot products without wasting output entries, thereby reducing the number of required MMA calls. Finally, BLEST combines kernel fusion with a lazy vertex update scheme to reduce host-side synchronisation, mitigate atomic overheads, and improve cache locality. Experiments show that BLEST delivers, on average, $3.58\times$, $4.64\times$ and $4.9\times$ speedup over BerryBees, Gunrock, and GSWITCH, respectively, across a broad set of real-world graphs.

Result: nncase在Qwen3系列模型上优于MLC LLM和Intel IPEX，在CPU上性能与手工优化的llama.cpp相当。

Conclusion: 自动化编译用于高性能大语言模型部署是可行的。

Abstract: The efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by memory architecture heterogeneity, where traditional compilers suffer from fragmented workflows and high adaptation costs. We present nncase, an open-source, end-to-end compilation framework designed to unify optimization across diverse targets. Central to nncase is an e-graph-based term rewriting engine that mitigates the phase ordering problem, enabling global exploration of computation and data movement strategies. The framework integrates three key modules: Auto Vectorize for adapting to heterogeneous computing units, Auto Distribution for searching parallel strategies with cost-aware communication optimization, and Auto Schedule for maximizing on-chip cache locality. Furthermore, a buffer-aware Codegen phase ensures efficient kernel instantiation. Evaluations show that nncase outperforms mainstream frameworks like MLC LLM and Intel IPEX on Qwen3 series models and achieves performance comparable to the hand-optimized llama.cpp on CPUs, demonstrating the viability of automated compilation for high-performance LLM deployment.

Motivation: 现有DLRM训练框架中，工人与参数服务器间的嵌入传输成本高，影响训练周期，且要应对边缘网络异构和资源有限的挑战。

Method: 开发ESD机制，基于预期嵌入传输成本优化输入嵌入样本调度；在ESD中提出HybridDis调度决策方法，结合最优算法和启发式算法。

Result: 实现ESD原型并与现有机制对比，ESD最多降低36.76%的嵌入传输成本，端到端DLRM训练速度最多提升1.74倍。

Conclusion: ESD能有效减少边缘设备上DLRM训练的嵌入传输成本，提升训练速度。

Abstract: Training deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) on edge workers brings several benefits, particularly in terms of data privacy protection, low latency and personalization. However, due to the huge size of embedding tables, typical DLRM training frameworks adopt one or more parameter servers to maintain global embedding tables, while leveraging the edge workers cache part of them. This incurs significant transmission cost for embedding transmissions between workers and parameter servers, which can dominate the training cycle. In this paper, we investigate how to dispatch input embedding samples to appropriate edge workers to minimize the total embedding transmission cost when facing edge-specific challenges such as heterogeneous networks and limited resources. We develop ESD, a novel mechanism that optimizes the dispatch of input embedding samples to edge workers based on expected embedding transmission cost. We propose HybridDis as the dispatch decision method within ESD, which combines a resource-intensive optimal algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to balance decision quality and resource consumption. We implement a prototype of ESD and compare it with state-of-the-art mechanisms on real-world workloads. Extensive experimental results show that ESD reduces the embedding transmission cost by up to 36.76% and achieves up to 1.74 times speedup in end-to-end DLRM training.

Conclusion: Hyperion能在动态网络上使用现成视觉Transformer对超高清视觉数据进行低延迟推理，有效解决计算和传输瓶颈。

Abstract: Recent advancements in array-camera videography enable real-time capturing of ultra-high-definition (Ultra-HD) videos, providing rich visual information in a large field of view. However, promptly processing such data using state-of-the-art transformer-based vision foundation models faces significant computational overhead in on-device computing or transmission overhead in cloud computing. In this paper, we present Hyperion, the first cloud-device collaborative framework that enables low-latency inference on Ultra-HD vision data using off-the-shelf vision transformers over dynamic networks. Hyperion addresses the computational and transmission bottleneck of Ultra-HD vision transformers by exploiting the intrinsic property in vision Transformer models. Specifically, Hyperion integrates a collaboration-aware importance scorer that identifies critical regions at the patch level, a dynamic scheduler that adaptively adjusts patch transmission quality to balance latency and accuracy under dynamic network conditions, and a weighted ensembler that fuses edge and cloud results to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyperion enhances frame processing rate by up to 1.61 times and improves the accuracy by up to 20.2% when compared with state-of-the-art baselines under various network environments.

These devices are inherently constrained by limited computational power and memory capacity, while bandwidth bottlenecks at the network edge further restrict distributed deployment and real-time responsiveness. Although existing research has explored lightweight optimization techniques to mitigate memory limitations, such approaches often incur significant degradation in model accuracy and performance. To address these challenges, we propose LIME, a collaborative system that enables lossless inference for large models across multiple memory-constrained edge devices under limited network bandwidth. LIME employs an interleaved pipeline parallelism in conjunction with model offloading to dynamically balance computation and communication. Furthermore, a fine-grained offline allocation scheduler and online memory adaptation strategy are introduced to enhance the device's computing and storage resources while minimizing inference latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIME, deployed on four heterogeneous Nvidia Jetson edge devices for LLaMA3.3-70B-Instruct model inference, achieves 1.7$\times$ and 3.7$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art baselines under sporadic and bursty request patterns respectively, without compromising model accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated extraordinary performance in many AI tasks but are expensive to use, even after training, due to their requirement of high-end GPUs. Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access.

Result: 实验表明FedAuto在多种连接故障场景下优于现有基线方法，甚至超过复杂通信资源优化策略。

Conclusion: FedAuto无需网络条件先验知识和修改现有基础设施，能无缝部署，有更强理论保证。

Abstract: Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT) has attracted growing interest as it leverages both server- and client-side data to enhance global model generalization while preserving privacy, and significantly reduces the computational burden on edge devices by avoiding training from scratch. Despite these advantages, FFT performance is often degraded by unreliable server-client connections and heterogeneous client data distributions. Most existing methods assume homogeneous network conditions or require prior knowledge of connection failures. However, these assumptions are impractical in real-world networks characterized by diverse communication standards (e.g., wired, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G) and heterogeneous failure patterns. To address these limitations, we propose FedAuto, a novel FFT framework that mitigates the combined effects of connection failures and data heterogeneity via adaptive aggregation. FedAuto operates without prior knowledge of network conditions or modifications to existing infrastructure, enabling seamless plug-and-play deployment. Moreover, we establish a rigorous convergence guarantee for FedAuto. By adopting a novel per-round aggregation perspective, our analysis removes the need for assumptions on connection failures probabilities or client selection strategies commonly imposed in prior work, and guarantees convergence of FedAuto for each individual realization, providing a stronger theoretical assurance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedAuto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under diverse connection failure scenarios for both full-parameter and partial-parameter fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA), and even surpasses strategies that rely on complex communication resource optimization.

Motivation: 现有通信库处理大规模Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)模型的数据混洗效果差，开销大。

Method: 基于MoE专家主数据布局与通信操作设备主布局冲突的观察，捕获细粒度数据布局，由流水线通信引擎执行混洗，辅以轻量级规划和负载均衡机制。

Result: 在代表性基准测试中，FUSCO比NCCL和DeepEP分别实现了高达3.84倍和2.01倍的加速；在端到端MoE任务中，降低了训练延迟和推理时首令牌生成延迟。

Conclusion: FUSCO能有效解决MoE模型数据混洗问题，提升训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models rely on \emph{expert parallelism} for efficient training and inference, which splits experts across devices and necessitates distributed data shuffling to route each token to its assigned experts. However, existing communication libraries handle this shuffling poorly; its overhead can account for over half of end-to-end runtime. We present FUSCO, an MoE-friendly communication library that achieves efficient and lightweight data shuffling through fused data transformation and communication, based on the key observation that MoE's expert-major data layout conflicts with the device-major layout expected by communication operations. FUSCO captures the fine-grained data layout, which is then interpreted by a pipelined communication engine that performs the required shuffling efficiently along the communication path. Lightweight planning and load-balancing mechanisms complement the engine by eliminating redundant communication and dispersing traffic. Evaluations on representative benchmarks illustrate that FUSCO achieves up to 3.84$\times$ and 2.01$\times$ speedups over NCCL and DeepEP (the state-of-the-art MoE communication library), respectively. In end-to-end MoE tasks, compared to NCCL and DeepEP, FUSCO reduces the training latency by 1.17-1.39$\times$ and 1.10-1.19$\times$, and lowers the first-token generation latency in inference by 1.09-1.25$\times$ and 1.06-1.16$\times$.

Conclusion: PRAXIS在诊断代码和配置导致的云事件方面表现出色，有较高的应用价值。

Abstract: Cloud incidents pose major operational challenges in production, with unresolved production cloud incidents cost on average over $2M per hour. Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration-caused cloud incidents. PRAXIS employs an LLM-driven structured traversal over two types of graph: (1) a service dependency graph (SDG) that captures microservice-level dependencies; and (2) a hammock-block program dependence graph (PDG) that captures code-level dependencies for each microservice. Together, these graphs encode microservice- and code-level dependencies and the LLM acts as a traversal policy over these graphs, moving between services and code dependencies to localize and explain failures. Compared to state-of-the-art ReAct baselines, PRAXIS improves RCA accuracy by up to 3.1x while reducing token consumption by 3.8x. PRAXIS is demonstrated on a set of 30 comprehensive real-world incidents that is being compiled into an RCA benchmark.

Abstract: We revisit the task of releasing marginal queries under differential privacy with additive (correlated) Gaussian noise. We first give a construction for answering arbitrary workloads of weighted marginal queries, over arbitrary domains. Our technique is based on releasing queries in the Fourier basis with independent noise with carefully calibrated variances, and reconstructing the marginal query answers using the inverse Fourier transform. We show that our algorithm, which is a factorization mechanism, is exactly optimal among all factorization mechanisms, both for minimizing the sum of weighted noise variances, and for minimizing the maximum noise variance. Unlike algorithms based on optimizing over all factorization mechanisms via semidefinite programming, our mechanism runs in time polynomial in the dataset and the output size. This construction recovers results of Xiao et al. [Neurips 2023] with a simpler algorithm and optimality proof, and a better running time.
  We then extend our approach to a generalization of marginals which we refer to as product queries. We show that our algorithm is still exactly optimal for this more general class of queries. Finally, we show how to embed extended marginal queries, which allow using a threshold predicate on numerical attributes, into product queries. We show that our mechanism is almost optimal among all factorization mechanisms for extended marginals, in the sense that it achieves the optimal (maximum or average) noise variance up to lower order terms.

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in spectral hypergraph sparsification, a natural generalization of spectral sparsification for graphs. In this paper, we present a simple fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining spectral hypergraph sparsifiers of \textit{directed} hypergraphs. Our algorithm achieves a near-optimal size of $O(n^2 / \varepsilon ^2 \log ^7 m)$ and amortized update time of $O(r^2 \log ^3 m)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices, and $m$ and $r$ respectively upper bound the number of hyperedges and the rank of the hypergraph at any time.
  We also extend our approach to the parallel batch-dynamic setting, where a batch of any $k$ hyperedge insertions or deletions can be processed with $O(kr^2 \log ^3 m)$ amortized work and $O(\log ^2 m)$ depth. This constitutes the first spectral-based sparsification algorithm in this setting.

This improves the previous best additive complexity of 60 additions without a change of basis. The result was discovered through an automated search combining ternary-restricted flip-graph exploration with greedy intersection reduction for common subexpression elimination.

Abstract: In search engine advertising (SEA) market, where competition among retailers is intense and multifaceted, channel coordination between retailers and manufacturers emerges as a critical factor, which significantly influences the effectiveness of advertising strategies. This research attempts to provide managerial guidelines for cooperative advertising in the SEA context by modeling two cooperative advertising decision scenarios. Scenario I defines a simple cooperative channel consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. In Scenario II, we consider a more general setting where there is an independent retailer who competes with the Manufacturer-Retailer alliance in Scenario I. We propose a novel cooperative advertising optimization model, wherein a manufacturer can advertise product directly through SEA campaigns and indirectly by subsidizing its retailer. To highlight the distinctive features of SEA, our model incorporates dynamic quality scores and focuses on a finite time horizon. In each scenario, we provide a feasible equilibrium solution of optimal policies for all members. Subsequently, we conduct numerical experiments to perform sensitivity analysis for both the quality score and gross margin. Additionally, we explore the impact of the initial market share of the competing retailer in Scenario II. Finally, we investigate how retail competition affects the cooperative alliance's optimal strategy and channel performance. Our identified properties derived from the equilibrium and numerical analyses offer crucial insights for participants engaged in cooperative advertising within the SEA market.

Result: 证明多图中无长度为3的环时EFX分配总是存在，在特定估值下算法有不同时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 本文结果是任意数量代理下EFX分配存在的少数案例之一。

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods among agents, with a focus on limiting envy. A central open question in this area is the existence of EFX allocations-allocations in which any envy of any agent i towards any agent j vanishes upon the removal of any single good from j's bundle. Establishing the existence of such allocations has proven notoriously difficult in general, but progress has been made for restricted valuation classes. Christodoulou et al. [2023] proved existence for graphical valuations, where goods correspond to edges in a graph, agents to nodes, and each agent values only incident edges. The graph was required to be simple, i.e., for any pair of agents, there could be at most one good that both agents value. The problem remained open, however, for multi-graph valuations, where for a pair of agents several goods may have value to both. In this setting, Sgouritsa and Sotiriou [2025] established existence whenever the shortest cycle with non-parallel edges has length at least six, while Afshinmehr et al. [2025] proved existence when the graph contains no odd cycles. In this paper, we strengthen these results by proving that EFX allocations always exist in multi-graphs that contain no cycle of length three. Assuming monotone valuations, we further provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for computing such an allocation, which runs in polynomial time when agents have cancelable valuations, a strict superclass of additive valuation functions. Accordingly, our results stand as one of the only cases where EFX allocations exist for an arbitrary number of agents.

Conclusion: 建立了有利于稀疏松弛法的严格概率任意时间分离，尽管精确方法最终仍是最优的。

Abstract: We study the classical coalition structure generation (CSG) problem and compare the anytime behavior of three algorithmic paradigms: dynamic programming (DP), MILP branch-and-bound, and sparse relaxations based on greedy or $l_1$-type methods. Under a simple random "sparse synergy" model for coalition values, we prove that sparse relaxations recover coalition structures whose welfare is arbitrarily close to optimal in polynomial time with high probability. In contrast, broad classes of DP and MILP algorithms require exponential time before attaining comparable solution quality. This establishes a rigorous probabilistic anytime separation in favor of sparse relaxations, even though exact methods remain ultimately optimal.

Abstract: We study a sequential mechanism design problem in which a principal seeks to elicit truthful reports from multiple rational agents while starting with no prior knowledge of agents' beliefs. We introduce Distributionally Robust Adaptive Mechanism (DRAM), a general framework combining insights from both mechanism design and online learning to jointly address truthfulness and cost-optimality. Throughout the sequential game, the mechanism estimates agents' beliefs and iteratively updates a distributionally robust linear program with shrinking ambiguity sets to reduce payments while preserving truthfulness. Our mechanism guarantees truthful reporting with high probability while achieving $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret, and we establish a matching lower bound showing that no truthful adaptive mechanism can asymptotically do better. The framework generalizes to plug-in estimators, supporting structured priors and delayed feedback. To our knowledge, this is the first adaptive mechanism under general settings that maintains truthfulness and achieves optimal regret when incentive constraints are unknown and must be learned.

Conclusion: 理论和模拟表明，策略用户费用低于最低包含费用时应立即提费。

Abstract: Transaction fee plays an important role in determining the priority of transaction processing in public blockchain systems. Owing to the observability of unconfirmed transactions, a strategic user can postpone his transaction broadcasting time and set a fee as low as possible by prying into his mempool that stores them. However, the stochastic mining interval may cause the delayed transaction to miss the next valid block. Meanwhile, a new feature (i.e. fee bumping) emerges that allows each user to increase his transaction fee before confirmation, making the fee setting more challenging. In this paper, we investigate a novel transaction policy from the perspective of a single strategic user that determines the broadcasting time and the transaction fee simultaneously. Two representative scenarios are considered, in which a number of coexisting ordinary users are mempool-oblivious that set their fees according to certain distribution, and are semi-strategic that check their mempools at a Poisson rate and update their fees. In the former, we compute the optimal broadcasting time and transaction fee that adapts to the arbitrary distribution of mining interval. When the block interval is exponentially distributed in Bitcoin-like PoW systems, the strategic user needs to broadcast his transaction immediately after its creation. And when the block interval is fixed in Ethereum-like PoS systems, he finds it profitable to wait until the last moment before block generation. In the latter, we formulate a continuous-time Markov chain to characterize the dynamics of mempool states, and derive the optimal fee adjusting frequency of the strategic user when the block interval is exponentially distributed. In both theory and simulations, we show that this strategic user should immediately increase his fee whenever it falls behind the minimum fee of being included.

Conclusion: VDA - SAP拍卖机制在理论和实际应用中都具有优势，适合农产品销售场景。

Abstract: This paper is motivated by the need to design a robust market mechanism to benefit farmers (producers of agricultural produce) as well as buyers of agricultural produce (consumers). Our proposal is a volume discount auction with a Farmer Collective (FC) as the selling agent and high volume or retail consumers as buying agents. An FC is a cooperative of farmers coming together to harness the power of aggregation and economies of scale. Our auction mechanism seeks to satisfy fundamental properties such as incentive compatibility and individual rationality, and an extremely relevant property for the agriculture setting, namely, Nash social welfare maximization. Besides satisfying these properties, our proposed auction mechanism also ensures that certain practical business constraints are met. Since an auction satisfying all of these properties exactly is a theoretical impossibility, we invoke the idea of designing deep learning networks that learn such an auction with minimal violation of the desired properties. The proposed auction, which we call VDA-SAP (Volume Discount Auction for Selling Agricultural Produce), is superior in many ways to the classical VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism in terms of richness of properties satisfied and further outperforms other baseline auctions as well. We demonstrate our results for a realistic setting of an FC selling perishable vegetables to potential buyers.

Conclusion: 选择性LLM引导正则化框架有效，可提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Large language models provide rich semantic priors and strong reasoning capabilities, making them promising auxiliary signals for recommendation. However, prevailing approaches either deploy LLMs as standalone recommender or apply global knowledge distillation, both of which suffer from inherent drawbacks. Standalone LLM recommender are costly, biased, and unreliable across large regions of the user item space, while global distillation forces the downstream model to imitate LLM predictions even when such guidance is inaccurate. Meanwhile, recent studies show that LLMs excel particularly in re-ranking and challenging scenarios, rather than uniformly across all contexts.We introduce Selective LLM Guided Regularization, a model-agnostic and computation efficient framework that activates LLM based pairwise ranking supervision only when a trainable gating mechanism informing by user history length, item popularity, and model uncertainty predicts the LLM to be reliable. All LLM scoring is performed offline, transferring knowledge without increasing inference cost. Experiments across multiple datasets show that this selective strategy consistently improves overall accuracy and yields substantial gains in cold start and long tail regimes, outperforming global distillation baselines.

Conclusion: CEMG能有效解决生成推荐模型的问题。

Abstract: Generative recommendation models often struggle with two key challenges: (1) the superficial integration of collaborative signals, and (2) the decoupled fusion of multimodal features. These limitations hinder the creation of a truly holistic item representation. To overcome this, we propose CEMG, a novel Collaborative-Enhaned Multimodal Generative Recommendation framework. Our approach features a Multimodal Fusion Layer that dynamically integrates visual and textual features under the guidance of collaborative signals. Subsequently, a Unified Modality Tokenization stage employs a Residual Quantization VAE (RQ-VAE) to convert this fused representation into discrete semantic codes. Finally, in the End-to-End Generative Recommendation stage, a large language model is fine-tuned to autoregressively generate these item codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CEMG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 提出LLM - I2I框架，包含基于LLM的生成器合成用户 - 物品交互数据，基于LLM的判别器过滤噪声交互，融合数据训练I2I模型。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可在不修改模型架构的情况下提升数据驱动推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Item-to-Item (I2I) recommendation models are widely used in real-world systems due to their scalability, real-time capabilities, and high recommendation quality. Research to enhance I2I performance focuses on two directions: 1) model-centric approaches, which adopt deeper architectures but risk increased computational costs and deployment complexity, and 2) data-centric methods, which refine training data without altering models, offering cost-effectiveness but struggling with data sparsity and noise. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-I2I, a data-centric framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate data quality issues. LLM-I2I includes (1) an LLM-based generator that synthesizes user-item interactions for long-tail items, alleviating data sparsity, and (2) an LLM-based discriminator that filters noisy interactions from real and synthetic data. The refined data is then fused to train I2I models. Evaluated on industry (AEDS) and academic (ARD) datasets, LLM-I2I consistently improves recommendation accuracy, particularly for long-tail items. Deployed on a large-scale cross-border e-commerce platform, it boosts recall number (RN) by 6.02% and gross merchandise value (GMV) by 1.22% over existing I2I models. This work highlights the potential of LLMs in enhancing data-centric recommendation systems without modifying model architectures.

Abstract: In this paper, we present KG20C and KG20C-QA, two curated datasets for advancing question answering (QA) research on scholarly data. KG20C is a high-quality scholarly knowledge graph constructed from the Microsoft Academic Graph through targeted selection of venues, quality-based filtering, and schema definition. Although KG20C has been available online in non-peer-reviewed sources such as GitHub repository, this paper provides the first formal, peer-reviewed description of the dataset, including clear documentation of its construction and specifications. KG20C-QA is built upon KG20C to support QA tasks on scholarly data. We define a set of QA templates that convert graph triples into natural language question--answer pairs, producing a benchmark that can be used both with graph-based models such as knowledge graph embeddings and with text-based models such as large language models. We benchmark standard knowledge graph embedding methods on KG20C-QA, analyze performance across relation types, and provide reproducible evaluation protocols. By officially releasing these datasets with thorough documentation, we aim to contribute a reusable, extensible resource for the research community, enabling future work in QA, reasoning, and knowledge-driven applications in the scholarly domain. The full datasets will be released at https://github.com/tranhungnghiep/KG20C/ upon paper publication.

TL;DR: 对冻结的大视频语言模型(LVLMs)在微视频推荐中的集成进行系统实证研究，提出DFF框架并取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在微视频推荐中的集成缺乏系统实证评估，从业者多将其作为固定黑盒特征提取器使用，未系统比较替代表示策略。

Method: 从ID嵌入集成策略（替换与融合）和特征提取范式（LVLM生成的字幕与中间解码器隐藏状态）两个关键设计维度开展系统实证研究，在此基础上提出DFF框架。

Result: 中间隐藏状态优于基于字幕的表示；ID嵌入融合优于替换；中间解码器特征在各层的有效性差异显著；DFF框架在两个真实微视频推荐基准上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DFF框架是一种轻量级、即插即用的方法，为将现成的大视觉语言模型集成到微视频推荐系统提供了一种有原则的方法。

Abstract: Frozen Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly employed in micro-video recommendation due to their strong multimodal understanding. However, their integration lacks systematic empirical evaluation: practitioners typically deploy LVLMs as fixed black-box feature extractors without systematically comparing alternative representation strategies. To address this gap, we present the first systematic empirical study along two key design dimensions: (i) integration strategies with ID embeddings, specifically replacement versus fusion, and (ii) feature extraction paradigms, comparing LVLM-generated captions with intermediate decoder hidden states. Extensive experiments on representative LVLMs reveal three key principles: (1) intermediate hidden states consistently outperform caption-based representations, as natural-language summarization inevitably discards fine-grained visual semantics crucial for recommendation; (2) ID embeddings capture irreplaceable collaborative signals, rendering fusion strictly superior to replacement; and (3) the effectiveness of intermediate decoder features varies significantly across layers. Guided by these insights, we propose the Dual Feature Fusion (DFF) Framework, a lightweight and plug-and-play approach that adaptively fuses multi-layer representations from frozen LVLMs with item ID embeddings. DFF achieves state-of-the-art performance on two real-world micro-video recommendation benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines and providing a principled approach to integrating off-the-shelf large vision-language models into micro-video recommender systems.

TL;DR: 提出用于有损压缩质量预测的通用深度代理框架DeepCQ，在四个真实科学应用中验证其有效性，预测误差大多低于10%，能降低科学数据分析的I/O和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估压缩后数据质量的计算成本高，需要高效方法。

Method: 开发可泛化的代理模型，采用两阶段设计解耦特征提取和指标预测，用混合专家设计优化对时间演化数据的性能。

Result: DeepCQ预测准确性高，多数情况下预测误差低于10%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeepCQ框架能让科学用户基于数据质量做决策，降低科学数据分析的I/O和计算开销。

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression techniques have become vital for scientific data management and analytics, given the ever-increasing volume of data generated by modern scientific simulations and instruments. Nevertheless, assessing data quality post-compression remains computationally expensive due to the intensive nature of metric calculations. In this work, we present a general-purpose deep-surrogate framework for lossy compression quality prediction (DeepCQ), with the following key contributions: 1) We develop a surrogate model for compression quality prediction that is generalizable to different error-bounded lossy compressors, quality metrics, and input datasets; 2) We adopt a novel two-stage design that decouples the computationally expensive feature-extraction stage from the light-weight metrics prediction, enabling efficient training and modular inference; 3) We optimize the model performance on time-evolving data using a mixture-of-experts design. Such a design enhances the robustness when predicting across simulation timesteps, especially when the training and test data exhibit significant variation. We validate the effectiveness of DeepCQ on four real-world scientific applications. Our results highlight the framework's exceptional predictive accuracy, with prediction errors generally under 10\% across most settings, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our framework empowers scientific users to make informed decisions about data compression based on their preferred data quality, thereby significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in scientific data analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域数据稀缺和保密问题阻碍模型开发与测试，需要评估合成金融数据。

Method: 提出统一多标准评估框架，应用于统计ARIMA - GARCH基线、变分自编码器（VAEs）和时间序列生成对抗网络（TimeGAN）三种范式，用历史S&P 500数据从保真度、时间结构和下游任务实用性等方面评估。

Result: ARIMA - GARCH捕捉线性趋势和条件波动性但无法重现非线性动态；VAEs生成轨迹平滑但低估极端事件；TimeGAN在真实性和时间连贯性上取得最佳平衡，MMD最低。

Conclusion: 根据应用需求和计算约束给出选择生成模型的实用指南，统一评估协议和可复现代码库旨在规范合成金融数据研究基准。

Abstract: Data scarcity and confidentiality in finance often impede model development and robust testing. This paper presents a unified multi-criteria evaluation framework for synthetic financial data and applies it to three representative generative paradigms: the statistical ARIMA-GARCH baseline, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN). Using historical S and P 500 daily data, we evaluate fidelity (Maximum Mean Discrepancy, MMD), temporal structure (autocorrelation and volatility clustering), and practical utility in downstream tasks, specifically mean-variance portfolio optimization and volatility forecasting. Empirical results indicate that ARIMA-GARCH captures linear trends and conditional volatility but fails to reproduce nonlinear dynamics; VAEs produce smooth trajectories that underestimate extreme events; and TimeGAN achieves the best trade-off between realism and temporal coherence (e.g., TimeGAN attained the lowest MMD: 1.84e-3, average over 5 seeds). Finally, we articulate practical guidelines for selecting generative models according to application needs and computational constraints. Our unified evaluation protocol and reproducible codebase aim to standardize benchmarking in synthetic financial data research.

Motivation: 当前差分隐私联邦学习方法依赖不现实假设，且忽视实际特性，阻碍实际应用。

Method: 引入Fed-$α$-NormEC框架，集成局部更新、不同步长和部分客户端参与。

Result: 在私有深度学习任务实验中证实了理论保证。

Conclusion: Fed-$α$-NormEC能在标准假设下提供可证明的收敛性和差分隐私保证，支持实际特性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training on decentralized data. Differential privacy (DP) is crucial for FL, but current private methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients or heterogeneity), hindering practical application. Existing works that relax these assumptions typically neglect practical FL features, including multiple local updates and partial client participation. We introduce Fed-$α$-NormEC, the first differentially private FL framework providing provable convergence and DP guarantees under standard assumptions while fully supporting these practical features. Fed-$α$-NormE integrates local updates (full and incremental gradient steps), separate server and client stepsizes, and, crucially, partial client participation, which is essential for real-world deployment and vital for privacy amplification. Our theoretical guarantees are corroborated by experiments on private deep learning tasks.

Result: 分析了策略学习器，给出依赖指标类通用函数复杂度度量的有限样本策略误差界。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法对未知偏好噪声分布和规模具有鲁棒性，且可直接优化策略而无需显式拟合奖励。

Abstract: Aligning large language models to preference data is commonly implemented by assuming a known link function between the distribution of observed preferences and the unobserved rewards (e.g., a logistic link as in Bradley-Terry). If the link is wrong, however, inferred rewards can be biased and policies be misaligned. We study policy alignment to preferences under an unknown and unrestricted link. We consider an $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization problem and show that realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar-valued index determined by a policy captures the dependence on demonstrations and the rest of the preference distribution is an unrestricted function thereof. Rather than focus on estimation of identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters in the index as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning, focusing on error to the optimal policy and allowing unidentifiable and nonparametric indices. We develop a variety of policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and using link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives. We analyze these and provide finite-sample policy error bounds that depend on generic functional complexity measures of the index class. We further consider practical implementations using first-order optimization suited to neural networks and batched data. The resulting methods are robust to unknown preference noise distribution and scale, while preserving the direct optimization of policies without explicitly fitting rewards.

Abstract: This thesis presents a physics-informed machine learning framework for solving the Floquet-Bloch eigenvalue problem associated with particles in two-dimensional periodic potentials, with a focus on honeycomb lattice geometry, due to its distinctive band topology featuring Dirac points and its relevance to materials such as graphene. By leveraging neural networks to learn complex Bloch functions and their associated eigenvalues (energies) simultaneously, we develop a mesh-free solver enforcing the governing Schrödinger equation, Bloch periodicity, and normalization constraints through a composite loss function without supervision. The model is trained over the Brillouin zone to recover band structures and Bloch modes, with numerical validation against traditional plane-wave expansion methods. We further explore transfer learning techniques to adapt the solver from nearly-free electron potentials to strongly varying potentials, demonstrating its ability to capture changes in band structure topology. This work contributes to the growing field of physics-informed machine learning for quantum eigenproblems, providing insights into the interplay between symmetry, band structure, and neural architectures.

Method: 将SDG重构为强化学习问题，引入RLSyn框架，用近端策略优化和判别器奖励优化数据生成器。

Result: RLSyn在MIMIC - IV上与扩散模型表现相当且优于GANs，在较小的AI - READI数据集上优于扩散模型和GANs。

Conclusion: 强化学习为合成生物医学数据提供了原则性且有效的替代方案，尤其适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation (SDG) is a promising approach for enabling data sharing in biomedical studies while preserving patient privacy. Yet, state-of-the-art generative models often require large datasets and complex training procedures, limiting their applicability in small-sample settings. In this work, we reframe SDG as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and introduce RLSyn, a novel framework that models the data generator as a stochastic policy over patient records and optimizes it using Proximal Policy Optimization with discriminator-derived rewards, yielding more stable and data-efficient training. We evaluate RLSyn on two biomedical datasets - AI-READI and MIMIC-IV- and benchmark it against state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion-based methods across extensive privacy, utility, and fidelity evaluations. RL-Syn performs comparably to diffusion models and outperforms GANs on MIMIC-IV, while outperforming both diffusion models and GANs on the smaller AI-READI dataset. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning provides a principled and effective alternative for synthetic biomedical data generation, particularly in data-scarce regimes.

Conclusion: 为下一代无线网络基于学习的新鲜度优化建立了统一基础，指出了延迟决策、随机变化和跨层设计等方面的开放挑战。

Abstract: The age of information (AoI) has become a central measure of data freshness in modern wireless systems, yet existing surveys either focus on classical AoI formulations or provide broad discussions of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks without addressing freshness as a unified learning problem. Motivated by this gap, this survey examines RL specifically through the lens of AoI and generalized freshness optimization. We organize AoI and its variants into native, function-based, and application-oriented families, providing a clearer view of how freshness should be modeled in B5G and 6G systems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a policy-centric taxonomy that reflects the decisions most relevant to freshness, consisting of update-control RL, medium-access RL, risk-sensitive RL, and multi-agent RL. This structure provides a coherent framework for understanding how learning can support sampling, scheduling, trajectory planning, medium access, and distributed coordination. We further synthesize recent progress in RL-driven freshness control and highlight open challenges related to delayed decision processes, stochastic variability, and cross-layer design. The goal is to establish a unified foundation for learning-based freshness optimization in next-generation wireless networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MDLMs采样速度受限，蒸馏加速方法存在问题，需新方法提升效率。

Method: 提出基于GRPO的dUltra框架，引入解掩码规划头，联合优化基础扩散LLM和解掩码顺序规划器，结合多种奖励信号。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务上，dUltra在准确率与效率权衡上优于现有启发式和蒸馏基线。

Conclusion: dUltra推动MDLMs在准确率和效率上进步，朝着超越自回归模型方向发展。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) offer the potential for parallel token generation, but most open-source MDLMs decode fewer than 5 tokens per model forward pass even with sophisticated sampling strategies. As a result, their sampling speeds are often comparable to AR + speculative decoding schemes, limiting their advantage over mainstream autoregressive approaches. Existing distillation-based accelerators (dParallel, d3LLM) finetune MDLMs on trajectories generated by a base model, which can become off-policy during finetuning and restrict performance to the quality of the base model's samples. We propose \texttt{dUltra}, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that learns unmasking strategies for efficient parallel decoding. dUltra introduces an unmasking planner head that predicts per-token unmasking likelihoods under independent Bernoulli distributions. We jointly optimize the base diffusion LLM and the unmasking order planner using reward signals combining verifiable reward, distillation reward, and the number of unmasking steps. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, dUltra improves the accuracy--efficiency trade-off over state-of-the-art heuristic and distillation baselines, moving towards achieving ``diffusion supremacy'' over autoregressive models.

Result: 在符合ASHRAE 2021标准的合成数据上测试，检测准确率达96.5%，90%概率下预测准确率87%，可提前2 - 4小时预测泄漏，1分钟内识别突发事件。

Conclusion: 虽仅在合成数据验证，但结果证明该系统在可持续数据中心运营中有部署可行性。

Abstract: AI data centers which are GPU centric, have adopted liquid cooling to handle extreme heat loads, but coolant leaks result in substantial energy loss through unplanned shutdowns and extended repair periods. We present a proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection. Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware. The system employs MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards, forecasting leaks 2-4 hours ahead while identifying sudden events within 1 minute. For a typical 47-rack facility, this approach could prevent roughly 1,500 kWh annual energy waste through proactive maintenance rather than reactive emergency procedures. While validation remains synthetic-only, results establish feasibility for future operational deployment in sustainable data center operations.

Conclusion: 通过应用展现框架能恢复已知结果，并得出将变换结构与优化几何实证观察相联系的新特征。

Abstract: Many theoretical results in deep learning can be traced to symmetry or equivariance of neural networks under parameter transformations. However, existing analyses are typically problem-specific and focus on first-order consequences such as conservation laws, while the implications for second-order structure remain less understood. We develop a general equivariance toolbox that yields coupled first- and second-order constraints on learning dynamics. The framework extends classical Noether-type analyses in three directions: from gradient constraints to Hessian constraints, from symmetry to general equivariance, and from continuous to discrete transformations. At the first order, our framework unifies conservation laws and implicit-bias relations as special cases of a single identity. At the second order, it provides structural predictions about curvature: which directions are flat or sharp, how the gradient aligns with Hessian eigenspaces, and how the loss landscape geometry reflects the underlying transformation structure. We illustrate the framework through several applications, recovering known results while also deriving new characterizations that connect transformation structure to modern empirical observations about optimization geometry.

Abstract: We present an RL-central framework for Language and Vision Assistants (RLLaVA) with its formulation of Markov decision process (MDP). RLLaVA decouples RL algorithmic logic from model architecture and distributed execution, supporting researchers in implementing new RL algorithms with minimal code, and to plug in a broad family of RL methods and vision-language models (VLMs) while remaining agnostic to specific training and inference engines. RLLaVA makes resource-efficient training of 1B--7B models feasible on common GPUs; notably, 4B-scale models can be trained end-to-end with full-parameter updates on a single 24GB GPU. Experiments on multi-modal and agentic tasks demonstrate that RLLaVA has task extensibility, and the models trained with it consistently improve performance over base models, competitive with other specially engineered RL frameworks.

Conclusion: 经过验证的深度学习模型比传统方法能为公共卫生规划提供更可靠预测，高风险领域需校准技术。

Abstract: Substance overdose mortality in the United States claimed over 80,000 lives in 2023, with the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating existing trends through healthcare disruptions and behavioral changes. Estimating excess mortality, defined as deaths beyond expected levels based on pre-pandemic patterns, is essential for understanding pandemic impacts and informing intervention strategies. However, traditional statistical methods like SARIMA assume linearity, stationarity, and fixed seasonality, which may not hold under structural disruptions. We present a systematic comparison of SARIMA against three deep learning (DL) architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer) for counterfactual mortality estimation using national CDC data (2015-2019 for training/validation, 2020-2023 for projection). We contribute empirical evidence that LSTM achieves superior point estimation (17.08% MAPE vs. 23.88% for SARIMA) and better-calibrated uncertainty (68.8% vs. 47.9% prediction interval coverage) when projecting under regime change. We also demonstrate that attention-based models (Seq2Seq, Transformer) underperform due to overfitting to historical means rather than capturing emergent trends. Ourreproducible pipeline incorporates conformal prediction intervals and convergence analysis across 60+ trials per configuration, and we provide an open-source framework deployable with 15 state health departments. Our findings establish that carefully validated DL models can provide more reliable counterfactual estimates than traditional methods for public health planning, while highlighting the need for calibration techniques when deploying neural forecasting in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Functional tensor decomposition can analyze multi-dimensional data with real-valued indices, paving the path for applications in machine learning and signal processing. A limitation of existing approaches is the assumption that the tensor rank-a critical parameter governing model complexity-is known. However, determining the optimal rank is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) task and there is a limited understanding regarding the expressive power of functional low-rank tensor models for continuous signals. We propose a rank-revealing functional Bayesian tensor completion (RR-FBTC) method. Modeling the latent functions through carefully designed multioutput Gaussian processes, RR-FBTC handles tensors with real-valued indices while enabling automatic tensor rank determination during the inference process. We establish the universal approximation property of the model for continuous multi-dimensional signals, demonstrating its expressive power in a concise format. To learn this model, we employ the variational inference framework and derive an efficient algorithm with closed-form updates. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the RR-FBTC over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: As wearable sensing becomes increasingly pervasive, a key challenge remains: how can we generate natural language summaries from raw physiological signals such as actigraphy - minute-level movement data collected via accelerometers? In this work, we introduce MotionTeller, a generative framework that natively integrates minute-level wearable activity data with large language models (LLMs). MotionTeller combines a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that maps behavioral embeddings into the token space of a frozen decoder-only LLM, enabling free-text, autoregressive generation of daily behavioral summaries. We construct a novel dataset of 54383 (actigraphy, text) pairs derived from real-world NHANES recordings, and train the model using cross-entropy loss with supervision only on the language tokens. MotionTeller achieves high semantic fidelity (BERTScore-F1 = 0.924) and lexical accuracy (ROUGE-1 = 0.722), outperforming prompt-based baselines by 7 percent in ROUGE-1. The average training loss converges to 0.38 by epoch 15, indicating stable optimization. Qualitative analysis confirms that MotionTeller captures circadian structure and behavioral transitions, while PCA plots reveal enhanced cluster alignment in embedding space post-training. Together, these results position MotionTeller as a scalable, interpretable system for transforming wearable sensor data into fluent, human-centered descriptions, introducing new pathways for behavioral monitoring, clinical review, and personalized health interventions.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实验，TreeEIC达到了最先进的不完整多视图聚类性能。

Conclusion: TreeEIC在高度不一致缺失模式下有优异性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Real-world multi-view data usually exhibits highly inconsistent missing patterns which challenges the effectiveness of incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决持续预训练数据利用问题，提升训练效果。

Abstract: Continual Pre-training (CPT) serves as a fundamental approach for adapting foundation models to domain-specific applications. Scaling laws for pre-training define a power-law relationship between dataset size and the test loss of an LLM. However, the marginal gains from simply increasing data for CPT diminish rapidly, yielding suboptimal data utilization and inefficient training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel perplexity-aware data scaling law to establish a predictive relationship between the perplexity landscape of domain-specific data and the test loss. Our approach leverages the perplexity derived from the pre-trained model on domain data as a proxy for estimating the knowledge gap, effectively quantifying the informational perplexity landscape of candidate training samples. By fitting this scaling law across diverse perplexity regimes, we enable adaptive selection of high-utility data subsets, prioritizing content that maximizes knowledge absorption while minimizing redundancy and noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently identifies near-optimal training subsets and achieves superior performance on both medical and general-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL) plays an important role in exploring complementary information for multi-view clustering (MVC) and has attracted increasing attention. Nevertheless, real-world multi-view data suffer from data incompleteness or noise, resulting in rare-paired samples or mis-paired samples which significantly challenges the effectiveness of CL-based MVC. That is, rare-paired issue prevents MVC from extracting sufficient multi-view complementary information, and mis-paired issue causes contrastive learning to optimize the model in the wrong direction. To address these issues, we propose a unified CL-based MVC framework for enhancing clustering effectiveness on incomplete and noise multi-view data. First, to overcome the rare-paired issue, we design a global-graph guided contrastive learning, where all view samples construct a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for fully exploring complementary information. Second, to mitigate the mis-paired issue, we propose a local-graph weighted contrastive learning, which leverages local neighbors to generate pair-wise weights to adaptively strength or weaken the pair-wise contrastive learning. Our method is imputation-free and can be integrated into a unified global-local graph-guided contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments on both incomplete and noise settings of multi-view data demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, typically focused on estimating or maximizing expected returns, face challenges when refining offline pretrained models with online experiences. This paper introduces Generative Actor Critic (GAC), a novel framework that decouples sequential decision-making by reframing \textit{policy evaluation} as learning a generative model of the joint distribution over trajectories and returns, $p(τ, y)$, and \textit{policy improvement} as performing versatile inference on this learned model. To operationalize GAC, we introduce a specific instantiation based on a latent variable model that features continuous latent plan vectors. We develop novel inference strategies for both \textit{exploitation}, by optimizing latent plans to maximize expected returns, and \textit{exploration}, by sampling latent plans conditioned on dynamically adjusted target returns. Experiments on Gym-MuJoCo and Maze2D benchmarks demonstrate GAC's strong offline performance and significantly enhanced offline-to-online improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods, even in absence of step-wise rewards.

Abstract: Accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is critical for accelerating novel drug development. However, current computational methods struggle to capture intricate sequence dependencies and effectively handle ambiguous, hard-to-classify samples. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Fusion, a novel two-stage deep learning framework integrating adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. Unlike traditional static feature concatenation, we construct a panoramic feature space using 10 distinct descriptors and introduce an Adaptive Gating Mechanism.This mechanism dynamically regulates the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Furthermore, to address data distribution challenges, we employ a contrastive learning strategy driven by Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) and BLOSUM62-based data augmentation, which significantly sharpens the model's decision boundaries. Experimental results on the benchmark Set 1 dataset demonstrate that AVP-Fusion achieves an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. In the second stage, leveraging transfer learning, the model enables precise subclass prediction for six viral families and eight specific viruses, even under limited sample sizes. In summary, AVP-Fusion serves as a robust and interpretable tool for high-throughput antiviral drug screening.

Conclusion: AnchorGK能有效解决时空克里金问题，提升预测准确性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal kriging is a fundamental problem in sensor networks, driven by the sparsity of deployed sensors and the resulting missing observations. Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging.

Result: 在多个金融基准上的模拟表明，RefineBridge能持续提升不同预测时间范围内最先进TSFMs的性能。

Conclusion: RefineBridge可有效提升TSFMs在金融时间序列预测中的性能。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is particularly challenging for transformer-based time series foundation models (TSFMs) due to non-stationarity, heavy-tailed distributions, and high-frequency noise present in data. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained TSFMs to downstream data domains. However, it still underperforms in financial data, as it preserves the network architecture and training objective of TSFMs rather than complementing the foundation model. To further enhance TSFMs, we propose a novel refinement module, RefineBridge, built upon a tractable Schrödinger Bridge (SB) generative framework. Given the forecasts of TSFM as generative prior and the observed ground truths as targets, RefineBridge learns context-conditioned stochastic transport maps to improve TSFM predictions, iteratively approaching the ground-truth target from even a low-quality prior. Simulations on multiple financial benchmarks demonstrate that RefineBridge consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs across different prediction horizons.

Conclusion: 首次证明视频可支持极高效视觉策略学习，无需其他专家监督。

Abstract: Humans can efficiently extract knowledge and learn skills from the videos within only a few trials and errors. However, it poses a big challenge to replicate this learning process for autonomous agents, due to the complexity of visual input, the absence of action or reward signals, and the limitations of interaction steps. In this paper, we propose a novel, unsupervised, and sample-efficient framework to achieve imitation learning from videos (ILV), named Behavior Cloning from Videos via Latent Representations (BCV-LR). BCV-LR extracts action-related latent features from high-dimensional video inputs through self-supervised tasks, and then leverages a dynamics-based unsupervised objective to predict latent actions between consecutive frames. The pre-trained latent actions are fine-tuned and efficiently aligned to the real action space online (with collected interactions) for policy behavior cloning. The cloned policy in turn enriches the agent experience for further latent action finetuning, resulting in an iterative policy improvement that is highly sample-efficient.
  We conduct extensive experiments on a set of challenging visual tasks, including both discrete control and continuous control. BCV-LR enables effective (even expert-level on some tasks) policy performance with only a few interactions, surpassing state-of-the-art ILV baselines and reinforcement learning methods (provided with environmental rewards) in terms of sample efficiency across 24/28 tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work for the first time demonstrates that videos can support extremely sample-efficient visual policy learning, without the need to access any other expert supervision.

Abstract: Emergency and intensive care environments require predictive models that are both accurate and computationally efficient, yet clinical data in these settings are often severely imbalanced. Such skewness undermines model reliability, particularly for rare but clinically crucial outcomes, making robustness and scalability essential for real-world usage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the robustness and scalability of classical machine learning models on imbalanced tabular data from MIMIC-IV-ED and eICU. Class imbalance was quantified using complementary metrics, and we compared the performance of tree-based methods, the state-of-the-art TabNet deep learning model, and a custom lightweight residual network. TabResNet was designed as a computationally efficient alternative to TabNet, replacing its complex attention mechanisms with a streamlined residual architecture to maintain representational capacity for real-time clinical use. All models were optimized via a Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed on predictive performance, robustness to increasing imbalance, and computational scalability. Our results, on seven clinically vital predictive tasks, show that tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and incurred higher computational costs, while TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks. These findings indicate that in emergency and critical care, robustness to imbalance and computational scalability could outweigh architectural complexity. Tree-based ensemble methods currently offer the most practical and clinically feasible choice, equipping practitioners with a framework for selecting models suited to high-stakes, time-sensitive environments.

Abstract: This study presents a data-driven, multi-objective approach to predict the mechanical performance, flow ability, and porosity of Ultra-High-Performance Concrete (UHPC). Out of 21 machine learning algorithms tested, five high-performing models are selected, with XGBoost showing the best accuracy after hyperparameter tuning using Random Search and K-Fold Cross-Validation. The framework follows a two-stage process: the initial XGBoost model is built using raw data, and once selected as the final model, the dataset is cleaned by (1) removing multicollinear features, (2) identifying outliers with Isolation Forest, and (3) selecting important features using SHAP analysis. The refined dataset as model 2 is then used to retrain XGBoost, which achieves high prediction accuracy across all outputs. A graphical user interface (GUI) is also developed to support material designers. Overall, the proposed framework significantly improves the prediction accuracy and minimizes the need for extensive experimental testing in UHPC mix design.

Abstract: Parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling a wide range of physical and engineering systems influenced by uncertain or varying parameters. Traditional neural network-based solvers, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Deep Galerkin Methods, often face challenges in generalization and long-time prediction efficiency due to their dependence on full space-time approximations. To address these issues, we propose a novel and scalable framework that significantly enhances the Neural Galerkin Method (NGM) by incorporating the Meta-Auto-Decoder (MAD) paradigm. Our approach leverages space-time decoupling to enable more stable and efficient time integration, while meta-learning-driven adaptation allows rapid generalization to unseen parameter configurations with minimal retraining. Furthermore, randomized sparse updates effectively reduce computational costs without compromising accuracy. Together, these advancements enable our method to achieve physically consistent, long-horizon predictions for complex parameterized evolution equations with significantly lower computational overhead. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that our methods performs comparatively well in terms of accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.

Abstract: This research develops and evaluates machine learning models to predict the mechanical properties of steel-polypropylene fiber-reinforced high-performance concrete (HPC). Three model families were investigated: Extra Trees with XGBoost (ET-XGB), Random Forest with LightGBM (RF-LGBM), and Transformer with XGBoost (Transformer-XGB). The target properties included compressive strength (CS), flexural strength (FS), and tensile strength (TS), based on an extensive dataset compiled from published experimental studies. Model training involved k-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), and uncertainty analysis to ensure both robustness and interpretability. Among the tested approaches, the ET-XGB model achieved the highest overall accuracy, with testing R^2 values of 0.994 for CS, 0.944 for FS, and 0.978 for TS and exhibited lowest uncertainty for CS and TS (approximately 13-16% and 30.4%, respectively). The RF-LGBM model provided the most stable and reliable predictions for FS (R^2 0.977), yielding the lowest uncertainty for FS (approximately 5-33%). The Transformer-XGB model demonstrated strong predictive capability (R^2 0.978 for TS and 0.967 for FS) but consistently showed the highest uncertainty, indicating reduced generalization reliability. SHAP analysis further indicated that fiber aspect ratios (AR1 and AR2), silica fume (Sfu), and steel fiber content (SF) were the most influential predictors of strength, whereas water content (W) and the water-binder ratio (w/b) consistently had negative effects. The findings confirm that machine learning models can provide accurate, interpretable, and generalizable predictions of HPC mechanical properties. These models offer valuable tools for optimizing concrete mix design and enhancing structural performance evaluation in engineering applications.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has profoundly influenced reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating planning and learning in tasks requiring long-horizon reasoning, exemplified by the AlphaZero family of algorithms. Central to MCTS is the search strategy, governed by a tree policy based on an upper confidence bound (UCB) applied to trees (UCT). A key factor in the success of AlphaZero is the introduction of a prior term in the UCB1-based tree policy PUCT, which improves exploration efficiency and thus accelerates training. While many alternative UCBs with stronger theoretical guarantees than UCB1 exist, extending them to prior-based UCTs has been challenging, since PUCT was derived empirically rather than from first principles. Recent work retrospectively justified PUCT by framing MCTS as a regularized policy optimization (RPO) problem. Building on this perspective, we introduce Inverse-RPO, a general methodology that systematically derives prior-based UCTs from any prior-free UCB. Applying this method to the variance-aware UCB-V, we obtain two new prior-based tree policies that incorporate variance estimates into the search. Experiments indicate that these variance-aware prior-based UCTs outperform PUCT across multiple benchmarks without incurring additional computational cost. We also provide an extension of the mctx library supporting variance-aware UCTs, showing that the required code changes are minimal and intended to facilitate further research on principled prior-based UCTs.

Abstract: Multimodal Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) is critical for quality assurance in smart manufacturing, particularly in complex processes like robotic welding. However, existing methods often suffer from causal blindness, treating process modalities (e.g., real-time video, audio, and sensors) and result modalities (e.g., post-weld images) as equal feature sources, thereby ignoring the inherent physical generative logic. Furthermore, the heterogeneity gap between high-dimensional visual data and low-dimensional sensor signals frequently leads to critical process context being drowned out. In this paper, we propose Causal-HM, a unified multimodal UAD framework that explicitly models the physical Process to Result dependency. Specifically, our framework incorporates two key innovations: a Sensor-Guided CHM Modulation mechanism that utilizes low-dimensional sensor signals as context to guide high-dimensional audio-visual feature extraction , and a Causal-Hierarchical Architecture that enforces a unidirectional generative mapping to identify anomalies that violate physical consistency. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed Weld-4M benchmark across four modalities demonstrate that Causal-HM achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) I-AUROC of 90.7%. Code will be released after the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 提出的新数据感知后训练量化方法能有效提升1位大语言模型量化性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, but their massive sizes hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. To reduce their computational and memory burden, various compression techniques have been proposed, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Among these, post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted for its efficiency, as it requires no retraining and only a small dataset for calibration, enabling low-cost deployment. Recent advances for post-training quantization have demonstrated that even sub-4-bit methods can maintain most of the original model performance. However, 1-bit quantization that converts floating-point weights to \(\pm\)1, remains particularly challenging, as existing 1-bit PTQ methods often suffer from significant performance degradation compared to the full-precision models. Specifically, most of existing 1-bit PTQ approaches focus on weight alignment, aligning the full-precision model weights with those of the quantized models, rather than directly aligning their outputs. Although the output-matching approach objective is more intuitive and aligns with the quantization goal, naively applying it in 1-bit LLMs often leads to notable performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate why and under what conditions output-matching fails, in the context of 1-bit LLM quantization. Based on our findings, we propose a novel data-aware PTQ approach for 1-bit LLMs that explicitly accounts for activation error accumulation while keeping optimization efficient. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our solution consistently outperforms existing 1-bit PTQ methods with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are widely used for distribution learning, yet their classical formulations remain theoretically fragile, with ill-posed objectives, unstable training dynamics, and limited interpretability. In this work, we introduce \emph{Dictionary-Transform Generative Adversarial Networks} (DT-GAN), a fully model-based adversarial framework in which the generator is a sparse synthesis dictionary and the discriminator is an analysis transform acting as an energy model. By restricting both players to linear operators with explicit constraints, DT-GAN departs fundamentally from neural GAN architectures and admits rigorous theoretical analysis.
  We show that the DT-GAN adversarial game is well posed and admits at least one Nash equilibrium. Under a sparse generative model, equilibrium solutions are provably identifiable up to standard permutation and sign ambiguities and exhibit a precise geometric alignment between synthesis and analysis operators. We further establish finite-sample stability and consistency of empirical equilibria, demonstrating that DT-GAN training converges reliably under standard sampling assumptions and remains robust in heavy-tailed regimes.
  Experiments on mixture-structured synthetic data validate the theoretical predictions, showing that DT-GAN consistently recovers underlying structure and exhibits stable behavior under identical optimization budgets where a standard GAN degrades. DT-GAN is not proposed as a universal replacement for neural GANs, but as a principled adversarial alternative for data distributions that admit sparse synthesis structure. The results demonstrate that adversarial learning can be made interpretable, stable, and provably correct when grounded in classical sparse modeling.

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation services such as navigation and ride-hailing. In such applications, uncertainty estimation in forecasting is important because it helps evaluate traffic risk levels, assess forecast reliability, and provide timely warnings. As a result, probabilistic traffic flow forecasting (PTFF) has gained significant attention, as it produces both point forecasts and uncertainty estimates. However, existing PTFF approaches still face two key challenges: (1) how to uncover and model the causes of traffic flow uncertainty for reliable forecasting, and (2) how to capture the spatiotemporal correlations of uncertainty for accurate prediction.
  To address these challenges, we propose RIPCN, a Road Impedance Principal Component Network that integrates domain-specific transportation theory with spatiotemporal principal component learning for PTFF. RIPCN introduces a dynamic impedance evolution network that captures directional traffic transfer patterns driven by road congestion level and flow variability, revealing the direct causes of uncertainty and enhancing both reliability and interpretability. In addition, a principal component network is designed to forecast the dominant eigenvectors of future flow covariance, enabling the model to capture spatiotemporal uncertainty correlations. This design allows for accurate and efficient uncertainty estimation while also improving point prediction performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting methods.

Abstract: Agentic language model (LM) systems power modern applications like "Deep Research" and "Claude Code," and leverage multi-LM architectures to overcome context limitations. Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller "compressor" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger "predictor" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\times$ more accurate, $4.6\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\%$ of API costs.

Conclusion: 提出的方法具有通用性，可与重放和基于正则化的方法无缝集成，能解决持续学习中过度拟合和拟合不足的问题。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to acquire new tasks while preserving performance on previously learned ones, but most methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting. Existing approaches typically treat all layers uniformly, often trading stability for plasticity or vice versa. However, different layers naturally exhibit varying levels of uncertainty (entropy) when classifying tasks. High-entropy layers tend to underfit by failing to capture task-specific patterns, while low-entropy layers risk overfitting by becoming overly confident and specialized. To address this imbalance, we propose an entropy-aware continual learning method that employs a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate each layer based on its entropy. Specifically, our approach reduces entropy in high-entropy layers to mitigate underfitting and increases entropy in overly confident layers to alleviate overfitting. This adaptive regulation encourages the model to converge to wider local minima, which have been shown to improve generalization. Our method is general and can be seamlessly integrated with both replay- and regularization-based approaches. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art continual learning baselines.

Abstract: The problem of explaining the results produced by machine learning methods continues to attract attention. Neural network (NN) models, along with gradient boosting machines, are expected to be utilized even in tabular data with high prediction accuracy. This study addresses the related issues of pseudo-correlation, causality, and combinatorial reasons for tabular data in NN predictors. We propose a causal explanation method, CENNET, and a new explanation power index using entropy for the method. CENNET provides causal explanations for predictions by NNs and uses structural causal models (SCMs) effectively combined with the NNs although SCMs are usually not used as predictive models on their own in terms of predictive accuracy. We show that CEN-NET provides such explanations through comparative experiments with existing methods on both synthetic and quasi-real data in classification tasks.

Abstract: We derive an approximation error bound that holds simultaneously for a function and all its derivatives up to any prescribed order. The bounds apply to elementary functions, including multivariate polynomials, the exponential function, and the reciprocal function, and are obtained using feedforward neural networks with the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation. In addition, we report the network size, weight magnitudes, and behavior at infinity. Our analysis begins with a constructive approximation of multiplication, where we prove the simultaneous validity of error bounds over domains of increasing size for a given approximator. Leveraging this result, we obtain approximation guarantees for division and the exponential function, ensuring that all higher-order derivatives of the resulting approximators remain globally bounded.

Abstract: Genomic prediction of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains challenging due to complex epistatic interactions and highly variable sequencing data quality. We present a novel Interpretable Variant-Aware Multi-Path Network (VAMP-Net) that addresses both challenges through complementary machine learning pathways. Path-1 employs a Set Attention Transformer processing permutation-invariant variant sets to capture epistatic interactions between genomic loci. Path-2 utilizes a 1D Convolutional Neural Network that analyzes Variant Call Format quality metrics to learn adaptive confidence scores. A fusion module combines both pathways for final resistance classification. We conduct comparative evaluations of unmasked versus padding-masked Set Attention Blocks, and demonstrate that our multi-path architecture achieves superior performance over baseline CNN and MLP models, with accuracy exceeding 95% and AUC around 97% for Rifampicin (RIF) and Rifabutin (RFB) resistance prediction. The framework provides dual-layer interpretability: Attention Weight Analysis reveals Epistatic networks, and Integrated Gradients (IG) was applied for critical resistance loci (notably rpoB), while gradient-based feature importance from the CNN pathway uncovers drug-specific dependencies on data quality metrics. This architecture advances clinical genomics by delivering state-of-the-art predictive performance alongside auditable interpretability at two distinct levels, genetic causality of mutation sets and technical confidence of sequencing evidence, establishing a new paradigm for robust, clinically-actionable resistance prediction.

Abstract: The reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved by training them with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.

Abstract: We propose an explainable, privacy-preserving dataset distillation framework for collaborative financial fraud detection. A trained random forest is converted into transparent, axis-aligned rule regions (leaf hyperrectangles), and synthetic transactions are generated by uniformly sampling within each region. This produces a compact, auditable surrogate dataset that preserves local feature interactions without exposing sensitive original records. The rule regions also support explainability: aggregated rule statistics (for example, support and lift) describe global patterns, while assigning each case to its generating region gives concise human-readable rationales and calibrated uncertainty based on tree-vote disagreement.
  On the IEEE-CIS fraud dataset (590k transactions across three institution-like clusters), distilled datasets reduce data volume by 85% to 93% (often under 15% of the original) while maintaining competitive precision and micro-F1, with only a modest AUC drop. Sharing and augmenting with synthesized data across institutions improves cross-cluster precision, recall, and AUC. Real vs. synthesized structure remains highly similar (over 93% by nearest-neighbor cosine analysis). Membership-inference attacks perform at chance level (about 0.50) when distinguishing training from hold-out records, suggesting low memorization risk. Removing high-uncertainty synthetic points using disagreement scores further boosts AUC (up to 0.687) and improves calibration. Sensitivity tests show weak dependence on the distillation ratio (AUC about 0.641 to 0.645 from 6% to 60%).
  Overall, tree-region distillation enables trustworthy, deployable fraud analytics with interpretable global rules, per-case rationales with quantified uncertainty, and strong privacy properties suitable for multi-institution settings and regulatory audit.

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of multimodal data fusion in high-dimensional biomedical informatics, we propose MMCTOP, a MultiModal Clinical-Trial Outcome Prediction framework that integrates heterogeneous biomedical signals spanning (i) molecular structure representations, (ii) protocol metadata and long-form eligibility narratives, and (iii) disease ontologies. MMCTOP couples schema-guided textualization and input-fidelity validation with modality-aware representation learning, in which domain-specific encoders generate aligned embeddings that are fused by a transformer backbone augmented with a drug-disease-conditioned sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE). This design explicitly supports specialization across therapeutic and design subspaces while maintaining scalable computation through top-k routing. MMCTOP achieves consistent improvements in precision, F1, and AUC over unimodal and multimodal baselines on benchmark datasets, and ablations show that schema-guided textualization and selective expert routing contribute materially to performance and stability. We additionally apply temperature scaling to obtain calibrated probabilities, ensuring reliable risk estimation for downstream decision support. Overall, MMCTOP advances multimodal trial modeling by combining controlled narrative normalization, context-conditioned expert fusion, and operational safeguards aimed at auditability and reproducibility in biomedical informatics.

Result: GQ - VAE在压缩和语言建模性能上优于标准VQ - VAE，接近BPE；在相同压缩率下，GQ - VAE提升下游语言模型学习效果。

Conclusion: 提出未来工作的方向，代码开源。

Abstract: While most frontier models still use deterministic frequency-based tokenization algorithms such as byte-pair encoding (BPE), there has been significant recent work to design learned neural tokenizers. However, these schemes generally add to underlying language model complexity and force large changes to architecture, making them hard to implement at large scales. To overcome these challenges, we propose the gated quantized variational autoencoder (GQ-VAE), a novel architecture that can be independently pre-trained to serve as a drop-in replacement for existing tokenizers. The key innovation of the architecture is to learn to encode variable-length discrete tokens. GQ-VAE improves compression and language modeling performance over a standard VQ-VAE tokenizer, and approaches the compression rate and language modeling performance of BPE. Interestingly, if we use BPE with a smaller vocabulary, such that the compression is equivalent between GQ-VAE and BPE, we find that GQ-VAE improves downstream language model learning. We conclude with a discussion of several exciting avenues for future work. Code can be found at https://github.com/Theo-Datta-115/gq-vae.

Motivation: 现有表格数据生成方法难以处理异质数据，且生成数据在多样性和质量上存在权衡问题。

Method: 将原始异质数据分区，用LLM探索分布生成数据，设计多臂老虎机采样算法平衡多样性和质量。

Result: DATE在表格分类和回归基准测试中始终优于现有方法，平均减少23.75%错误率，能提高DPO准确性和LLM推理能力。

Conclusion: DATE框架有效解决了表格数据生成中的异质性和多样性 - 质量权衡问题。

Abstract: Tabular data generation has become increasingly essential for enabling robust machine learning applications, which require large-scale, high-quality data. Existing solutions leverage generative models to learn original data distributions. However, real-world data are naturally heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it challenging to obtain a universally good model for diverse data generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Tabular data gEnerator (DATE), a framework that (i) prepares high-quality and distributionally distinct examples for in-context learning by effectively partitioning the original heterogeneous data into multiple diverse subsets; (ii) harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the diversity of the partitioned distribution with decision tree reasoning as feedback, generating high-quality labeled data for each subset. However, the massive generated data inherently involves a trade-off between diversity and quality. To integrate this issue, existing solutions greedily select the validation-best data. However, we prove that the selection in heterogeneous settings does not possess the greedy-choice property, and design a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm that balances the diversity and quality of generated data. Extensive experiments on tabular classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that DATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods. On average, DATE achieves a 23.75% reduction in error rate with just 100 generated data. Empirically, we demonstrate that data generated by DATE can improve the accuracy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs on the target data.

Result: 理论上证明算法遗憾，实证显示算法有一致优势。

Conclusion: 当有高质量离线数据时，混合CUCB显著优于纯在线方法；数据有限或不一致时，能有效纠正纯离线方法的偏差。

Abstract: The problem of combinatorial multi-armed bandits with probabilistically triggered arms (CMAB-T) has been extensively studied. Prior work primarily focuses on either the online setting where an agent learns about the unknown environment through iterative interactions, or the offline setting where a policy is learned solely from logged data. However, each of these paradigms has inherent limitations: online algorithms suffer from high interaction costs and slow adaptation, while offline methods are constrained by dataset quality and lack of exploration capabilities. To address these complementary weaknesses, we propose hybrid CMAB-T, a new framework that integrates offline data with online interaction in a principled manner. Our proposed hybrid CUCB algorithm leverages offline data to guide exploration and accelerate convergence, while strategically incorporating online interactions to mitigate the insufficient coverage or distributional bias of the offline dataset. We provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's regret, demonstrating that hybrid CUCB significantly outperforms purely online approaches when high-quality offline data is available, and effectively corrects the bias inherent in offline-only methods when the data is limited or misaligned. Empirical results further demonstrate the consistent advantage of our algorithm.

Conclusion: 高保真序列嵌入可捕获结合模式，该框架无需3D结构，具高可扩展性，能加速治疗发现流程。

Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity between antigens and antibodies is fundamental to drug discovery and vaccine development. Traditional computational approaches often rely on experimentally determined 3D structures, which are scarce and computationally expensive to obtain. This paper introduces DuaDeep-SeqAffinity, a novel sequence-only deep learning framework that predicts affinity scores solely from their amino acid sequences using a dual-stream hybrid architecture. Our approach leverages pre-trained ESM-2 protein language model embeddings, combining 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local motif detection with Transformer encoders for global contextual representation. A subsequent fusion module integrates these multi-faceted features, which are then passed to a fully connected network for final score regression. Experimental results demonstrate that DuaDeep-SeqAffinity significantly outperforms individual architectural components and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. DuaDeep achieved a superior Pearson correlation of 0.688, an R^2 of 0.460, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.737, surpassing single-branch variants ESM-CNN and ESM-Transformer. Notably, the model achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.890, outperforming sequence-only benchmarks and even surpassing structure-sequence hybrid models. These findings prove that high-fidelity sequence embeddings can capture essential binding patterns typically reserved for structural modeling. By eliminating the reliance on 3D structures, DuaDeep-SeqAffinity provides a highly scalable and efficient solution for high-throughput screening of vast sequence libraries, significantly accelerating the therapeutic discovery pipeline.

Abstract: Robustness in complex systems is of significant engineering and economic importance. However, conventional attack-based a posteriori robustness assessments incur prohibitive computational overhead. Recently, deep learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have been widely employed as surrogates for rapid robustness prediction. Nevertheless, these methods neglect the complex higher-order correlations prevalent in real-world systems, which are naturally modeled as hypergraphs. Although Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted for hypergraph learning, their topological expressive power has not yet reached the theoretical upper bound. To address this limitation, inspired by Graph Isomorphism Networks, this paper proposes a hypergraph-level Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework. Theoretically, this approach is proven to possess an expressive power strictly equivalent to the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test and is applied to predict hypergraph robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that while maintaining superior efficiency in training and prediction, the proposed method not only outperforms existing graph-based models but also significantly surpasses conventional HGNNs in tasks that prioritize topological structure representation.

Conclusion: VWS空间平滑框架及相关算法在DOA估计中有优势。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a variable window size (VWS) spatial smoothing framework that enhances coarray-based direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for sparse linear arrays. By compressing the smoothing aperture, the proposed VWS Coarray MUSIC (VWS-CA-MUSIC) and VWS Coarray root-MUSIC (VWS-CA-rMUSIC) algorithms replace part of the perturbed rank-one outer products in the smoothed coarray data with unperturbed low-rank additional terms, increasing the separation between signal and noise subspaces, while preserving the signal subspace span. We also derive the bounds that guarantees identifiability, by limiting the values that can be assumed by the compression parameter. Simulations with sparse geometries reveal significant performance improvements and complexity savings relative to the fixed-window coarray MUSIC method.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in Continual Learning (CL) is catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to new tasks degrades the performance on previous ones. While the field has evolved with diverse methods, this rapid surge in diverse methodologies has culminated in a fragmented research landscape. The lack of a unified framework, including inconsistent implementations, conflicting dependencies, and varying evaluation protocols, makes fair comparison and reproducible research increasingly difficult. To address this challenge, we propose LibContinual, a comprehensive and reproducible library designed to serve as a foundational platform for realistic CL. Built upon a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, LibContinual integrates 19 representative algorithms across five major methodological categories, providing a standardized execution environment. Meanwhile, leveraging this unified framework, we systematically identify and investigate three implicit assumptions prevalent in mainstream evaluation: (1) offline data accessibility, (2) unregulated memory resources, and (3) intra-task semantic homogeneity. We argue that these assumptions often overestimate the real-world applicability of CL methods. Through our comprehensive analysis using strict online CL settings, a novel unified memory budget protocol, and a proposed category-randomized setting, we reveal significant performance drops in many representative CL methods when subjected to these real-world constraints. Our study underscores the necessity of resource-aware and semantically robust CL strategies, and offers LibContinual as a foundational toolkit for future research in realistic continual learning.

Abstract: Hit identification is a critical yet resource-intensive step in the drug discovery pipeline, traditionally relying on high-throughput screening of large compound libraries. Despite advancements in virtual screening, these methods remain time-consuming and costly. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled the development of generative models capable of learning complex molecular representations and generating novel compounds de novo. However, using ML to replace the entire drug-discovery pipeline is highly challenging. In this work, we rather investigate whether generative models can replace one step of the pipeline: hit-like molecule generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly frame hit-like molecule generation as a standalone task and empirically test whether generative models can directly support this stage of the drug discovery pipeline. Specifically, we investigate if such models can be trained to generate hit-like molecules, enabling direct incorporation into, or even substitution of, traditional hit identification workflows. We propose an evaluation framework tailored to this task, integrating physicochemical, structural, and bioactivity-related criteria within a multi-stage filtering pipeline that defines the hit-like chemical space. Two autoregressive and one diffusion-based generative models were benchmarked across various datasets and training settings, with outputs assessed using standard metrics and target-specific docking scores. Our results show that these models can generate valid, diverse, and biologically relevant compounds across multiple targets, with a few selected GSK-3$β$ hits synthesized and confirmed active in vitro. We also identify key limitations in current evaluation metrics and available training data.

Motivation: 现代学习系统稳定性分析的平滑性假设被ReLU型非线性违反，需研究其稳定性问题。

Method: 通过给出具体反例证明经典稳定性界限的失效，确定最小广义导数条件。

Result: 表明ReLU网络即使在训练轨迹经验上稳定的简单设置下，也不存在基于全局平滑性的稳定性代理。

Conclusion: 明确了ReLU平滑近似可能产生误导，应构建非平滑感知稳定性框架。

Abstract: Stability analyses of modern learning systems are frequently derived under smoothness assumptions that are violated by ReLU-type nonlinearities. In this note, we isolate a minimal obstruction by showing that no uniform smoothness-based stability proxy such as gradient Lipschitzness or Hessian control can hold globally for ReLU networks, even in simple settings where training trajectories appear empirically stable. We give a concrete counterexample demonstrating the failure of classical stability bounds and identify a minimal generalized derivative condition under which stability statements can be meaningfully restored. The result clarifies why smooth approximations of ReLU can be misleading and motivates nonsmooth-aware stability frameworks.

Conclusion: 有针对性的样本选择足以实现可扩展的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) is a strong and widely used first-order adversarial attack, yet its computational cost scales poorly, as all training samples undergo identical iterative inner-loop optimization despite contributing unequally to robustness. Motivated by this inefficiency, we propose \emph{Selective Adversarial Training}, which perturbs only a subset of critical samples in each minibatch. Specifically, we introduce two principled selection criteria: (1) margin-based sampling, which prioritizes samples near the decision boundary, and (2) gradient-matching sampling, which selects samples whose gradients align with the dominant batch optimization direction. Adversarial examples are generated only for the selected subset, while the remaining samples are trained cleanly using a mixed objective. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that the proposed methods achieve robustness comparable to, or even exceeding, full PGD adversarial training, while reducing adversarial computation by up to $50\%$, demonstrating that informed sample selection is sufficient for scalable adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: 通过理论分析，深入理解了大语言模型缩放定律，明确各变量对泛化上界的影响。

Abstract: The scaling law, a cornerstone of Large Language Model (LLM) development, predicts improvements in model performance with increasing computational resources. Yet, while empirically validated, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates this process to kernel behaviors. Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.
  We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $Θ(\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$. Beyond this unified framework, our theory derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size, elucidating how each variable independently governs the upper bounds of generalization.

Abstract: Automating end-to-end data science pipeline with AI agents still stalls on two gaps: generating insightful, diverse visual evidence and assembling it into a coherent, professional report. We present A2P-Vis, a two-part, multi-agent pipeline that turns raw datasets into a high-quality data-visualization report. The Data Analyzer orchestrates profiling, proposes diverse visualization directions, generates and executes plotting code, filters low-quality figures with a legibility checker, and elicits candidate insights that are automatically scored for depth, correctness, specificity, depth and actionability. The Presenter then orders topics, composes chart-grounded narratives from the top-ranked insights, writes justified transitions, and revises the document for clarity and consistency, yielding a coherent, publication-ready report. Together, these agents convert raw data into curated materials (charts + vetted insights) and into a readable narrative without manual glue work. We claim that by coupling a quality-assured Analyzer with a narrative Presenter, A2P-Vis operationalizes co-analysis end-to-end, improving the real-world usefulness of automated data analysis for practitioners.

Abstract: Multimodal regression aims to predict a continuous target from heterogeneous input sources and typically relies on fusion strategies such as early or late fusion. However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference. Implementation is available at https://github.com/zhaozhaoma/PIDReg.

Abstract: We introduce conserved active information $I^\oplus$, a symmetric extension of active information that quantifies net information gain/loss across the entire search space, respecting No-Free-Lunch conservation. Through Bernoulli and uniform-baseline examples, we show $I^\oplus$ reveals regimes hidden from KL divergence, such as when strong knowledge reduces global disorder. Such regimes are proven formally under uniform baseline, distinguishing disorder (increasing mild knowledge from order-imposing strong knowledge. We further illustrate these regimes with examples from Markov chains and cosmological fine-tuning. This resolves a longstanding critique of active information while enabling applications in search, optimization, and beyond.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping software engineering by profoundly influencing coding, documentation, and system maintenance practices. As these tools become deeply embedded in developers' daily workflows, understanding how they are used has become essential. This paper reports an empirical study of LLM adoption in software engineering, based on a survey of 46 industry professionals with diverse educational backgrounds and levels of experience. The results reveal positive perceptions of LLMs, particularly regarding faster resolution of technical questions, improved documentation support, and enhanced source code standardization. However, respondents also expressed concerns about cognitive dependence, security risks, and the potential erosion of technical autonomy. These findings underscore the need for critical and supervised use of LLM-based tools. By grounding the discussion in empirical evidence from industry practice, this study bridges the gap between academic discourse and real-world software development. The results provide actionable insights for developers and researchers seeking to adopt and evolve LLM-based technologies in a more effective, responsible, and secure manner, while also motivating future research on their cognitive, ethical, and organizational implications.

Conclusion: 消融实验证实进化组件对缩小大语言模型智能体感知差距的作用。

Abstract: Building on the affective dream-replay reinforcement learning framework of CosmoCore, we introduce CosmoCore-Evo, an extension that incorporates evolutionary algorithms to enhance adaptability and novelty in code generation tasks. Inspired by anthropological aspects of human evolution, such as natural selection and adaptation in early hominids, CosmoCore-Evo treats RL trajectories as ``genomes'' that undergo mutation and selection during the nocturnal replay phase. This mechanism allows agents to break free from trained patterns, fostering emergent behaviors and improved performance in distribution-shifted environments, such as changing APIs or novel libraries. We augment the Dream Queue with evolutionary operations, including mutation of high-fitness trajectories and enterprise-tuned fitness functions that incorporate efficiency, compliance, and scalability metrics. Evaluated on extended benchmarks including HumanEval variants with shifts, BigCodeBench, and a custom PySpark pipeline simulation, CosmoCore-Evo achieves up to 35% higher novelty in solutions and 25% faster adaptation compared to the original CosmoCore and baselines like PPO and REAMER.

TL;DR: 文章指出应将公平视为软件质量维度，现有偏差缓解方法有局限，提出 CoT 方法，实验表明其效果好并将公布结果和代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件公平性研究忽视其作为软件质量问题，且现有偏差缓解方法有困境，需新方法。

Method: 提出 Correlation Tuning (CoT) 预处理器方法，用 Phi - coefficient 量化相关性，用多目标优化解决代理偏差。

Result: CoT 使弱势群体的真阳性率平均提高 17.5%，关键偏差指标平均降低超 50%，单属性和多属性场景分别比现有方法高 3 和 10 个百分点。

Conclusion: CoT 方法有效，有助于解决软件公平性中的偏差问题，公开结果和代码利于后续研究。

Abstract: Traditional software fairness research typically emphasizes ethical and social imperatives, neglecting that fairness fundamentally represents a core software quality issue arising directly from performance disparities across sensitive user groups. Recognizing fairness explicitly as a software quality dimension yields practical benefits beyond ethical considerations, notably improved predictive performance for unprivileged groups, enhanced out-of-distribution generalization, and increased geographic transferability in real-world deployments. Nevertheless, existing bias mitigation methods face a critical dilemma: while pre-processing methods offer broad applicability across model types, they generally fall short in effectiveness compared to post-processing techniques. To overcome this challenge, we propose Correlation Tuning (CoT), a novel pre-processing approach designed to mitigate bias by adjusting data correlations. Specifically, CoT introduces the Phi-coefficient, an intuitive correlation measure, to systematically quantify correlation between sensitive attributes and labels, and employs multi-objective optimization to address the proxy biases. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CoT increases the true positive rate of unprivileged groups by an average of 17.5% and reduces three key bias metrics, including statistical parity difference (SPD), average odds difference (AOD), and equal opportunity difference (EOD), by more than 50% on average. CoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by three and ten percentage points in single attribute and multiple attributes scenarios, respectively. We will publicly release our experimental results and source code to facilitate future research.

Method: 提出多智能体委员会框架，让不同的视觉大语言模型通过三轮投票协议协作来达成测试动作共识，结合模型多样性、角色驱动的行为变化和视觉用户界面理解来系统探索 Web 应用。

Abstract: Manual software beta testing is costly and time-consuming, while single-agent large language model (LLM) approaches suffer from hallucinations and inconsistent behavior. We propose a multi-agent committee framework in which diverse vision-enabled LLMs collaborate through a three-round voting protocol to reach consensus on testing actions. The framework combines model diversity, persona-driven behavioral variation, and visual user interface understanding to systematically explore web applications. Across 84 experimental runs with 9 testing personas and 4 scenarios, multi-agent committees achieve an 89.5 percent overall task success rate. Configurations with 2 to 4 agents reach 91.7 to 100 percent success, compared to 78.0 percent for single-agent baselines, yielding improvements of 13.7 to 22.0 percentage points. At the action level, the system attains a 93.1 percent success rate with a median per-action latency of 0.71 seconds, enabling real-time and continuous integration testing. Vision-enabled agents successfully identify user interface elements, with navigation and reporting achieving 100 percent success and form filling achieving 99.2 percent success. We evaluate the framework on WebShop and OWASP benchmarks, achieving 74.7 percent success on WebShop compared to a 50.1 percent published GPT-3 baseline, and 82.0 percent success on OWASP Juice Shop security testing with coverage of 8 of the 10 OWASP Top 10 vulnerability categories. Across 20 injected regressions, the committee achieves an F1 score of 0.91 for bug detection, compared to 0.78 for single-agent baselines. The open-source implementation enables reproducible research and practical deployment of LLM-based software testing in CI/CD pipelines.

Abstract: We introduce AInsteinBench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating whether large language model (LLM) agents can operate as scientific computing development agents within real research software ecosystems. Unlike existing scientific reasoning benchmarks which focus on conceptual knowledge, or software engineering benchmarks that emphasize generic feature implementation and issue resolving, AInsteinBench evaluates models in end-to-end scientific development settings grounded in production-grade scientific repositories. The benchmark consists of tasks derived from maintainer-authored pull requests across six widely used scientific codebases, spanning quantum chemistry, quantum computing, molecular dynamics, numerical relativity, fluid dynamics, and cheminformatics. All benchmark tasks are carefully curated through multi-stage filtering and expert review to ensure scientific challenge, adequate test coverage, and well-calibrated difficulty. By leveraging evaluation in executable environments, scientifically meaningful failure modes, and test-driven verification, AInsteinBench measures a model's ability to move beyond surface-level code generation toward the core competencies required for computational scientific research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体性能依赖输入，GitHub Copilot的最佳实践建议有限且笼统，需要详细标准衡量GitHub问题质量以适配AI智能体。

Method: 构建32条详细标准，对比导致合并请求和关闭请求的GitHub问题，建立可解释的机器学习模型。

Result: 合并的请求来自简短、范围明确、有清晰指导和提示的问题；含外部引用的问题合并率低；模型AUC中位数72%。

Conclusion: 为撰写GitHub问题提供质量指标，鼓励进一步研究将撰写GitHub问题作为AI时代软件工程活动。

Abstract: AI-agents help developers in different coding tasks, such as developing new features, fixing bugs, and reviewing code. Developers can write a Github issue and assign it to an AI-agent like Copilot for implementation. Based on the issue and its related discussion, the AI-agent performs a plan for the implementation, and executes it. However, the performance of AI-agents and LLMs heavily depends on the input they receive. For instance, a GitHub issue that is unclear or not well scoped might not lead to a successful implementation that will eventually be merged. GitHub Copilot provides a set of best practice recommendations that are limited and high-level. In this paper, we build a set of 32 detailed criteria that we leverage to measure the quality of GitHub issues to make them suitable for AI-agents. We compare the GitHub issues that lead to a merged pull request versus closed pull request. Then, we build an interpretable machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a GitHub issue resulting in a merged pull request. We observe that pull requests that end up being merged are those originating from issues that are shorter, well scoped, with clear guidance and hints about the relevant artifacts for an issue, and with guidance on how to perform the implementation. Issues with external references including configuration, context setup, dependencies or external APIs are associated with lower merge rates. We built an interpretable machine learning model to help users identify how to improve a GitHub issue to increase the chances of the issue resulting in a merged pull request by Copilot. Our model has a median AUC of 72\%. Our results shed light on quality metrics relevant for writing GitHub issues and motivate future studies further investigate the writing of GitHub issues as a first-class software engineering activity in the era of AI-teammates.

Motivation: 在软件开发场景中，期望不实际执行代码片段就能检测运行时错误和异常，如在线代码集成前的异常检测。

Method: 提出Cerberus框架，使用LLMs生成触发错误输入，进行代码覆盖预测和错误检测，采用两阶段反馈循环。

Result: Cerberus比传统和基于学习的测试框架更高效生成高覆盖率测试用例，发现更多运行时错误。

Conclusion: Cerberus在检测（不）完整代码片段的运行时错误方面表现出色。

Abstract: In several software development scenarios, it is desirable to detect runtime errors and exceptions in code snippets without actual execution. A typical example is to detect runtime exceptions in online code snippets before integrating them into a codebase. In this paper, we propose Cerberus, a novel predictive, execution-free coverage-guided testing framework. Cerberus uses LLMs to generate the inputs that trigger runtime errors and to perform code coverage prediction and error detection without code execution. With a two-phase feedback loop, Cerberus first aims to both increasing code coverage and detecting runtime errors, then shifts to focus only detecting runtime errors when the coverage reaches 100% or its maximum, enabling it to perform better than prompting the LLMs for both purposes. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Cerberus performs better than conventional and learning-based testing frameworks for (in)complete code snippets by generating high-coverage test cases more efficiently, leading to the discovery of more runtime errors.

TL;DR: 提出FuzzWise将生成和最小化初始语料库集成，利用多代理LLM框架，评估显示其生成测试用例少、覆盖率高、触发错误多且更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于变异的灰盒模糊测试中，为初始语料库生成高质量输入种子对有效模糊测试至关重要，现有方法分阶段进行效率低。

Method: 提出FuzzWise，利用基于LLM的多代理框架，一个LLM代理生成测试用例，另一个评估其对覆盖率的贡献，采用预测方法无需实际执行。

Result: FuzzWise生成的测试用例比基线方法少，能实现高代码覆盖率，触发更多运行时错误。

Conclusion: FuzzWise在生成初始语料库时更节省时间和资源，捕获更多错误，更具效率。

Abstract: In mutation-based greybox fuzzing, generating high-quality input seeds for the initial corpus is essential for effective fuzzing. Rather than conducting separate phases for generating a large corpus and subsequently minimizing it, we propose FuzzWise which integrates them into one process to generate the optimal initial corpus of seeds (ICS). FuzzWise leverages a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The first LLM agent generates test cases for the target program. The second LLM agent, which functions as a predictive code coverage module, assesses whether each generated test case will enhance the overall coverage of the current corpus. The streamlined process allows each newly generated test seed to be immediately evaluated for its contribution to the overall coverage. FuzzWise employs a predictive approach using an LLM and eliminates the need for actual execution, saving computational resources and time, particularly in scenarios where the execution is not desirable or even impossible. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FuzzWise generates significantly fewer test cases than baseline methods. Despite the lower number of test cases, FuzzWise achieves high code coverage and triggers more runtime errors compared to the baselines. Moreover, it is more time-efficient and coverage-efficient in producing an initial corpus catching more errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有“Extract Method”重构中行为参数化在其他编程语言研究少，且编程语言规范影响技术适用性，需针对C#提出合适方法。

Method: 提出C#特定技术，用lambda表达式分析和合并代码克隆，应用于NiCad检测出的克隆对并评估。

Result: 评估22个项目的2217对克隆对，35.0%适合重构，其中28.9%成功重构。

Conclusion: 不同编程语言的最优“Extract Method”方法可能不同，提出的C#特定技术有一定效果。

Abstract: "Extract Method" refactoring is a technique for consolidating code clones. Parameterization approaches are used to extract a single method from multiple code clones that contain differences. This approach parameterizes expressions and behaviors within a method. In particular, behavior parameterization has been extensively studied in Java programs, but little research has been conducted on other programming languages.
  Lambda expressions can be used to parameterize behaviors, but the specifications of each programming language significantly affect the applicability of this technique. Therefore, the optimal "Extract Method" approach may vary depending on the programming language.
  In this study, we propose a C#-specific technique that uses lambda expressions to analyze and consolidate code clones. We evaluated our proposed method by applying it to code clones detected by the NiCad clone detector and measuring how many of them could be successfully consolidated.
  In total, 2,217 clone pairs from 22 projects were included in our evaluation. For the clone pairs determined to be refactorable, we also attempted refactoring actually. The proposed approach determined that 35.0% of all clone pairs were suitable for refactoring. Among these, 28.9% were successfully refactored.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动应用复杂度和设备环境碎片化使确保在线应用稳定性面临挑战，传统方法缺乏实时上下文信息，难以应对‘幽灵漏洞’，需动态运行时可观测性。

Method: 提出XTrace，采用非侵入式代理范式，利用并优化Android ART虚拟机内置的稳定插桩机制实现高性能方法拦截。

Result: 在有亿级日活用户的应用中评估，XTrace有生产级稳定性和性能，A/B实验显示对崩溃率和ANR率无显著影响，开销小、兼容性广，诊断出多个问题，提升根因定位效率超90%。

Conclusion: XTrace提供了生产级解决方案，解决Android动态追踪中稳定性和全面覆盖之间的长期矛盾。

Abstract: As the complexity of mobile applications grows exponentially and the fragmentation of user device environments intensifies, ensuring online application stability faces unprecedented challenges. Traditional methods, such as static logging and post-crash analysis, lack real-time contextual information, rendering them ineffective against "ghost bugs" that only manifest in specific scenarios. This highlights an urgent need for dynamic runtime observability: intercepting and tracing arbitrary methods in production without requiring an app release. We propose XTrace, a novel dynamic tracing framework. XTrace introduces a new paradigm of non-invasive proxying, which avoids direct modification of the virtual machine's underlying data structures. It achieves high-performance method interception by leveraging and optimizing the highly stable, built-in instrumentation mechanism of the Android ART virtual machine. Evaluated in a ByteDance application with hundreds of millions of daily active users, XTrace demonstrated production-grade stability and performance. Large-scale online A/B experiments confirmed its stability, showing no statistically significant impact (p > 0.05) on Crash User Rate or ANR rate, while maintaining minimal overhead (<7 ms startup latency, <0.01 ms per-method call) and broad compatibility (Android 5.0-15+). Critically, XTrace diagnosed over 11 severe online crashes and multiple performance bottlenecks, improving root-cause localization efficiency by over 90%. This confirms XTrace provides a production-grade solution that reconciles the long-standing conflict between stability and comprehensive coverage in Android dynamic tracing.

Motivation: Python动态类型机制引发运行时类型错误，现有工具在仓库级类型推断存在挑战。

Method: 构建实体依赖图（EDG），迭代细化类型和依赖，采用类型检查器策略验证和纠正推断。

Result: 在12个复杂Python仓库评估中，TypeSim得分0.89，TypeExact得分0.84，相对最强基线分别提升27%和40%，减少92.7%新类型错误。

Conclusion: methodName向真实Python开发的自动化、可靠类型注解迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Python's dynamic typing mechanism, while promoting flexibility, is a significant source of runtime type errors that plague large-scale software, which inspires the automatic type inference techniques. Existing type inference tools have achieved advances in type inference within isolated code snippets. However, repository-level type inference remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the complex inter-procedural dependencies that are difficult to model and resolve. To fill this gap, we present \methodName, a novel approach based on LLMs that achieves repository-level type inference through the co-evolution of types and dependencies. \methodName~constructs an Entity Dependency Graph (EDG) to model the objects and type dependencies across the repository. During the inference process, it iteratively refines types and dependencies in EDG for accurate type inference. Our key innovations are: (1) an EDG model designed to capture repository-level type dependencies; (2) an iterative type inference approach where types and dependencies co-evolve in each iteration; and (3) a type-checker-in-the-loop strategy that validates and corrects inferences on-the-fly, thereby reducing error propagation. When evaluated on 12 complex Python repositories, \methodName~significantly outperformed prior works, achieving a \textit{TypeSim} score of 0.89 and a \textit{TypeExact} score of 0.84, representing a 27\% and 40\% relative improvement over the strongest baseline. More importantly, \methodName~removed new type errors introduced by the tool by 92.7\%. This demonstrates a significant leap towards automated, reliable type annotation for real-world Python development.

Method: 分析AIDev数据集中324个代理生成和83个人类编写的性能优化PR，从采用、可维护性、优化模式和验证实践等方面进行比较。

Result: AI编写的性能PR包含显式性能验证的可能性低于人类编写的PR（45.7% vs. 63.6%，p = 0.007），且AI编写的PR与人类使用相似的优化模式。

Conclusion: 讨论了推进代理代码优化的局限性和机会。

Abstract: Performance optimization is a critical yet challenging aspect of software development, often requiring a deep understanding of system behavior, algorithmic tradeoffs, and careful code modifications. Although recent advances in AI coding agents have accelerated code generation and bug fixing, little is known about how these agents perform on real-world performance optimization tasks. We present the first empirical study comparing agent- and human-authored performance optimization commits, analyzing 324 agent-generated and 83 human-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset across adoption, maintainability, optimization patterns, and validation practices. We find that AI-authored performance PRs are less likely to include explicit performance validation than human-authored PRs (45.7\% vs. 63.6\%, $p=0.007$). In addition, AI-authored PRs largely use the same optimization patterns as humans. We further discuss limitations and opportunities for advancing agentic code optimization.

Conclusion: 研究为开发者、贡献者和从业者提供了两种生态系统互补优势的见解，并指出了相互增强的机会。

Abstract: A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) provides transparency by documenting software component metadata and dependencies. However, SBOM adoption depends on tool ecosystems. With two dominant formats: SPDX and CycloneDX - the ecosystems vary significantly in maturity, tool support, and community engagement. We conduct a quantitative comparison of use cases for 170 publicly advertised SBOM tools, identifying enhancement areas for each format. We compare health metrics of both ecosystems (171 CycloneDX versus 470 SPDX tools) to evaluate robustness and maturity. We quantitatively compare 36,990 issue reports from open-source tools to identify challenges and development opportunities. Finally, we investigate the top 250 open-source projects using each tool ecosystem and compare their health metrics. Our findings reveal distinct characteristics: projects using CycloneDX tools demonstrate higher developer engagement and certain health indicators, while SPDX tools benefit from a more mature ecosystem with broader tool availability and established industry adoption. This research provides insights for developers, contributors, and practitioners regarding complementary strengths of these ecosystems and identifies opportunities for mutual enhancement.

Motivation: 现有评估指标依赖标注日志数据，限制研究数据集且导致结论不一致，需要新的评估指标。

Method: 提出 PMSS 指标，用中心点轮廓分析和 Levenshtein 距离评估，在标准数据集上与 FGA、FTA 对比评估结果。

Result: PMSS 与 FGA、FTA 表现相近且显著正相关，PMSS 与 FGA 平均差异 2.1%，与 FTA 差异 9.8%。

Conclusion: 当真实标签不一致或不可用时，PMSS 是有价值的评估替代方案。

Abstract: Log parsing converts log messages into structured event templates, allowing for automated log analysis and reducing manual inspection effort. To select the most compatible parser for a specific system, multiple evaluation metrics are commonly used for performance comparisons. However, existing evaluation metrics heavily rely on labeled log data, which limits prior studies to a fixed set of datasets and hinders parser evaluations and selections in the industry. Further, we discovered that different versions of ground-truth used in existing studies can lead to inconsistent performance conclusions. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel label-free template-level metric, PMSS (parser medoid silhouette score), to evaluate log parser performance. PMSS evaluates both parser grouping and template quality with medoid silhouette analysis and Levenshtein distance within a near-linear time complexity in general. To understand its relationship with label-based template-level metrics, FGA and FTA, we compared their evaluation outcomes for six log parsers on the standard corrected Loghub 2.0 dataset. Our results indicate that log parsers achieving the highest PMSS or FGA exhibit comparable performance, differing by only 2.1% on average in terms of the FGA score; the difference is 9.8% for FTA. PMSS is also significantly (p<1e-8) and positively correlated to both FGA and FTA: the Spearman's rho correlation coefficient of PMSS-FGA and PMSS-FTA are respectively 0.648 and 0.587, close to the coefficient between FGA and FTA (0.670). We further extended our discussion on how to interpret the conclusions from different metrics, identifying challenges in using PMSS, and provided guidelines on conducting parser selections with our metric. PMSS provides a valuable evaluation alternative when ground-truths are inconsistent or labels are unavailable.

Abstract: Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems are poised to dominate industry and society imminently. Powered by goal-driven autonomy, they represent a powerful form of generative AI, marking a transition from reactive content generation into proactive multitasking capabilities. As an exemplar, we propose an architecture of a multi-agent system for the implementation phase of the software engineering process. We also present a comprehensive threat model for the proposed system. We demonstrate that while such systems can generate code quite accurately, they are vulnerable to attacks, including code injection. Due to their autonomous design and lack of humans in the loop, these systems cannot identify and respond to attacks by themselves. This paper analyzes the vulnerability of multi-agent systems and concludes that the coder-reviewer-tester architecture is more resilient than both the coder and coder-tester architectures, but is less efficient at writing code. We find that by adding a security analysis agent, we mitigate the loss in efficiency while achieving even better resiliency. We conclude by demonstrating that the security analysis agent is vulnerable to advanced code injection attacks, showing that embedding poisonous few-shot examples in the injected code can increase the attack success rate from 0% to 71.95%.

Abstract: Binary program analysis is still very important in system security. There are many practical achievements in binary code analysis, but fine-grained analysis such as dynamic taint analysis, is constantly studied due to the problem of deployability, high memory usage, and performance overhead, so as to better adapt to the new analysis scenario, such as memory corruption exploits and sandbox evasion malware. This paper presents a new binary program analysis framework, in order to improve the usability and performance of fine-grained analysis. The framework mainly uses the kernel module to further expand the analysis capability of the traditional dynamic binary instrumentation. Then, based on the idea of decoupling analysis, the analysis environment is constructed in the container process through process hollowing techniques in a new way. It can reuse the functions of the existing dynamic binary instrumentation platforms and also reduce the impact on the execution of the target program. The prototype is implemented on the Windows platform. The validity and performance of the framework are verified by a large number of experiments with benchmark and actual programs. The effectiveness of the framework is also verified by the analysis of actual exploit programs and malicious code, demonstrating the value of the practical application.

Motivation: 从运筹学角度研究稀疏指数跟踪投资组合构建与再平衡，强调不确定性量化和可实施性，实现紧密跟踪参考指数、控制成分股数量和再平衡周转率的目标。

Method: 将指数跟踪转化为高维线性回归，对权重采用拉普拉斯先验，用经验贝叶斯随机近似方案校准收缩参数，用近端朗之万型马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗算法近似权重后验分布，基于后验样本提出再平衡规则。

Result: 得到跟踪误差、投资组合构成和潜在再平衡行动的后验不确定性。

Conclusion: 通过跟踪标准普尔500指数的案例展示了从投资组合构建到再平衡的决策过程。

Abstract: We study the construction and rebalancing of sparse index-tracking portfolios from an operational research perspective, with explicit emphasis on uncertainty quantification and implementability. The decision variables are portfolio weights constrained to sum to one; the aims are to track a reference index closely while controlling the number of names and the turnover induced by rebalancing. We cast index tracking as a high-dimensional linear regression of index returns on constituent returns, and employ a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior on the weights. A single global shrinkage parameter controls the trade-off between tracking error and sparsity, and is calibrated by an empirical-Bayes stochastic approximation scheme. Conditional on this calibration, we approximate the posterior distribution of the portfolio weights using proximal Langevin-type Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms tailored to the budget constraint. This yields posterior uncertainty on tracking error, portfolio composition and prospective rebalancing moves. Building on these posterior samples, we propose rules for rebalancing that gate trades through magnitude-based thresholds and posterior activation probabilities, thereby trading off expected tracking error against turnover and portfolio size. A case study on tracking the S&P~500 index is carried out to showcase how our tools shape the decision process from portfolio construction to rebalancing.

Motivation: 解决定量金融研究中真实数据的隐私和可获取性问题。

Method: 以标普500历史日回报为基准，用生成模型（TimeGAN和VAE）生成合成数据集，用统计相似度指标、时间结构测试和下游金融任务评估。

Result: TimeGAN生成的数据接近真实回报；VAE训练更稳定但会平滑极端市场波动影响风险估计。

Conclusion: 合成数据可作为真实金融数据替代品用于投资组合分析和风险模拟，是金融实验和模型开发的有效工具。

Abstract: Synthetic financial data offers a practical way to address the privacy and accessibility challenges that limit research in quantitative finance. This paper examines the use of generative models, in particular TimeGAN and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), for creating synthetic return series that support portfolio construction, trading analysis, and risk modeling. Using historical daily returns from the S and P 500 as a benchmark, we generate synthetic datasets under comparable market conditions and evaluate them using statistical similarity metrics, temporal structure tests, and downstream financial tasks. The study shows that TimeGAN produces synthetic data with distributional shapes, volatility patterns, and autocorrelation behaviour that are close to those observed in real returns. When applied to mean-variance portfolio optimization, the resulting synthetic datasets lead to portfolio weights, Sharpe ratios, and risk levels that remain close to those obtained from real data. The VAE provides more stable training but tends to smooth extreme market movements, which affects risk estimation. Finally, the analysis supports the use of synthetic datasets as substitutes for real financial data in portfolio analysis and risk simulation, particularly when models are able to capture temporal dynamics. Synthetic data therefore provides a privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and reproducible tool for financial experimentation and model development.

### [122] [An approach to Fisher-Rao metric for infinite dimensional non-parametric information geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21451)

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Being infinite dimensional, non-parametric information geometry has long faced an "intractability barrier" due to the fact that the Fisher-Rao metric is now a functional incurring difficulties in defining its inverse. This paper introduces a novel framework to resolve the intractability with an Orthogonal Decomposition of the Tangent Space ($T_fM=S \oplus S^{\perp}$), where S represents an observable covariate subspace. Through the decomposition, we derive the Covariate Fisher Information Matrix (cFIM), denoted as $G_f$, which is a finite-dimensional and computable representative of information extractable from the manifold's geometry. Indeed, by proving the Trace Theorem: $H_G(f)=\text{Tr}(G_f)$, we establish a rigorous foundation for the G-entropy previously introduced by us, thereby identifying it not merely as a gradient-based regularizer, but also as a fundamental geometric invariant representing the total explainable statistical information captured by the probability distribution associated with the model. Furthermore, we establish a link between $G_f$ and the second-order derivative (i.e. the curvature) of the KL-divergence, leading to the notion of Covariate Cramér-Rao Lower Bound(CRLB). We demonstrate that $G_f$ is congruent to the Efficient Fisher Information Matrix, thereby providing fundamental limits of variance for semi-parametric estimators. Finally, we apply our geometric framework to the Manifold Hypothesis, lifting the latter from a heuristic assumption into a testable condition of rank-deficiency within the cFIM. By defining the Information Capture Ratio, we provide a rigorous method for estimating intrinsic dimensionality in high-dimensional data. In short, our work bridges the gap between abstract information geometry and the demand of explainable AI, by providing a tractable path for revealing the statistical coverage and the efficiency of non-parametric models.

TL;DR: 提出残差先验扩散（RPD）两阶段框架解决标准扩散模型在处理尺度不匹配数据时的问题，实验显示RPD表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准扩散模型依赖单一网络和扩散时间表，在处理尺度强烈不匹配的数据时，难以同时表示分布的全局结构和精细局部变化。

Method: 提出RPD两阶段框架，先由粗先验模型捕获数据分布的大规模结构，再用扩散模型表示先验与目标数据分布的残差；将RPD公式化为具有易处理证据下界的显式概率模型；引入辅助变量并进行理论分析。

Result: 在合成数据集上，标准扩散模型无法捕捉局部细节，RPD能准确捕捉精细细节并保留分布的大规模结构；在自然图像生成任务中，RPD生成质量与或超过代表性扩散基线，且在少量推理步骤下仍保持良好性能。

Conclusion: RPD框架有效解决了标准扩散模型在处理尺度不匹配数据时的问题，具有较好的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a central tool in deep generative modeling, but standard formulations rely on a single network and a single diffusion schedule to transform a simple prior, typically a standard normal distribution, into the target data distribution. As a result, the model must simultaneously represent the global structure of the distribution and its fine-scale local variations, which becomes difficult when these scales are strongly mismatched. This issue arises both in natural images, where coarse manifold-level structure and fine textures coexist, and in low-dimensional distributions with highly concentrated local structure. To address this issue, we propose Residual Prior Diffusion (RPD), a two-stage framework in which a coarse prior model first captures the large-scale structure of the data distribution, and a diffusion model is then trained to represent the residual between the prior and the target data distribution. We formulate RPD as an explicit probabilistic model with a tractable evidence lower bound, whose optimization reduces to the familiar objectives of noise prediction or velocity prediction. We further introduce auxiliary variables that leverage information from the prior model and theoretically analyze how they reduce the difficulty of the prediction problem in RPD. Experiments on synthetic datasets with fine-grained local structure show that standard diffusion models fail to capture local details, whereas RPD accurately captures fine-scale detail while preserving the large-scale structure of the distribution. On natural image generation tasks, RPD achieved generation quality that matched or exceeded that of representative diffusion-based baselines and it maintained strong performance even with a small number of inference steps.

Motivation: 开发一种简单、可扩展的算法，用于从非归一化密度采样和微调生成模型。

Method: 提出Tilt Matching方法，基于动力学方程将流匹配速度与目标分布倾斜的奖励联系起来，更新速度场。该算法无需访问奖励梯度或通过流或扩散轨迹反向传播。

Result: 算法高效且高度可扩展，在Lennard - Jones势采样中提供了最先进的结果，在微调Stable Diffusion方面有竞争力，且无需奖励乘数，还可应用于倾斜少步流图模型。

Conclusion: Tilt Matching算法是一种有效的从非归一化密度采样和微调生成模型的方法。

Abstract: We propose a simple, scalable algorithm for using stochastic interpolants to sample from unnormalized densities and for fine-tuning generative models. The approach, Tilt Matching, arises from a dynamical equation relating the flow matching velocity to one targeting the same distribution tilted by a reward, implicitly solving a stochastic optimal control problem. The new velocity inherits the regularity of stochastic interpolant transports while also being the minimizer of an objective with strictly lower variance than flow matching itself. The update to the velocity field can be interpreted as the sum of all joint cumulants of the stochastic interpolant and copies of the reward, and to first order is their covariance. The algorithms do not require any access to gradients of the reward or backpropagating through trajectories of the flow or diffusion. We empirically verify that the approach is efficient and highly scalable, providing state-of-the-art results on sampling under Lennard-Jones potentials and is competitive on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion, without requiring reward multipliers. It can also be straightforwardly applied to tilting few-step flow map models.

Motivation: 动态环境中光照条件变化会导致无人机光谱遥感数据严重失真，降低数据可用性，为获取高质量数据并保障飞行安全，需提出解决方案。

Method: 构建动态预测模型将光影干扰区转为三维虚拟障碍；引入改进IFDS算法生成初始避障路径；采用MPC框架优化路径；设计DFAA机制调整飞行高度。

Result: 相比传统PID和单避障算法，在密集干扰场景避障成功率达98%，显著提升路径平滑度，有效观测数据量增加约27%。

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂光照环境下无人机精准水质监测提供有效工程解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) spectral remote sensing technology is widely used in water quality monitoring. However, in dynamic environments, varying illumination conditions, such as shadows and specular reflection (sun glint), can cause severe spectral distortion, thereby reducing data availability. To maximize the acquisition of high-quality data while ensuring flight safety, this paper proposes an active path planning method for dynamic light and shadow disturbance avoidance. First, a dynamic prediction model is constructed to transform the time-varying light and shadow disturbance areas into three-dimensional virtual obstacles. Second, an improved Interfered Fluid Dynamical System (IFDS) algorithm is introduced, which generates a smooth initial obstacle avoidance path by building a repulsive force field. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is employed for rolling-horizon path optimization to handle flight dynamics constraints and achieve real-time trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment (DFAA) mechanism is designed to actively reduce the flight altitude when the observable area is narrow, thereby enhancing spatial resolution. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms, the proposed method achieves an obstacle avoidance success rate of 98% in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases the volume of effective observation data by approximately 27%. This research provides an effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments.

Abstract: Multi-robot path planning is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to its combinatorial complexity and the need to balance global efficiency with fair task allocation among robots. Traditional swarm intelligence methods, although effective on small instances, often converge prematurely and struggle to scale to complex environments. In this work, we present a structure-induced exploration framework that integrates structural priors into the search process of the ant colony optimization (ACO). The approach leverages the spatial distribution of the task to induce a structural prior at initialization, thereby constraining the search space. The pheromone update rule is then designed to emphasize structurally meaningful connections and incorporates a load-aware objective to reconcile the total travel distance with individual robot workload. An explicit overlap suppression strategy further ensures that tasks remain distinct and balanced across the team. The proposed framework was validated on diverse benchmark scenarios covering a wide range of instance sizes and robot team configurations. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in route compactness, stability, and workload distribution compared to representative metaheuristic baselines. Beyond performance gains, the method also provides a scalable and interpretable framework that can be readily applied to logistics, surveillance, and search-and-rescue applications where reliable large-scale coordination is essential.

Abstract: Embodied agents tasked with complex scenarios, whether in real or simulated environments, rely heavily on robust planning capabilities. When instructions are formulated in natural language, large language models (LLMs) equipped with extensive linguistic knowledge can play this role. However, to effectively exploit the ability of such models to handle linguistic ambiguity, to retrieve information from the environment, and to be based on the available skills of an agent, an appropriate architecture must be designed. We propose a Hierarchical Embodied Language Planner, called HELP, consisting of a set of LLM-based agents, each dedicated to solving a different subtask. We evaluate the proposed approach on a household task and perform real-world experiments with an embodied agent. We also focus on the use of open source LLMs with a relatively small number of parameters, to enable autonomous deployment.

This article details the design and development of MoonBot and presents a preliminary field demonstration that validates the proof of concept through the execution of milestone tasks simulating the establishment of lunar infrastructure. These tasks include essential civil engineering operations, infrastructural component transportation and deployment, and assistive operations with inflatable modules. Furthermore, we systematically summarize the lessons learned during testing, focusing on the connector design and providing valuable insights for the advancement of modular robotic systems in future lunar missions.

Result: ANWM在长距离视觉预测上显著优于现有世界模型，提高了无人机在大规模环境中的导航成功率。

Conclusion: ANWM能有效解决现有导航策略的不足。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as powerful embodied agents. One of the core abilities is autonomous navigation in large-scale three-dimensional environments. Existing navigation policies, however, are typically optimized for low-level objectives such as obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness, lacking the ability to incorporate high-level semantics into planning. To bridge this gap, we propose ANWM, an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, thereby enabling agents to rank candidate trajectories by their semantic plausibility and navigational utility. ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors. This module mitigates representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation and captures the mapping between 3D trajectories and egocentric observations. Empirical results demonstrate that ANWM significantly outperforms existing world models in long-distance visual forecasting and improves UAV navigation success rates in large-scale environments.

Abstract: Multitask learning poses significant challenges due to the highly multimodal and diverse nature of robot action distributions. However, effectively fitting policies to these complex task distributions is often difficult, and existing monolithic models often underfit the action distribution and lack the flexibility required for efficient adaptation. We introduce a novel modular diffusion policy framework that factorizes complex action distributions into a composition of specialized diffusion models, each capturing a distinct sub-mode of the behavior space for a more effective overall policy. In addition, this modular structure enables flexible policy adaptation to new tasks by adding or fine-tuning components, which inherently mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation settings, we illustrate how our method consistently outperforms strong modular and monolithic baselines.

Conclusion: Bahar - Hausmann的回归结果不能为移民与委内瑞拉石油收入关系提供有效推断依据。

Abstract: Bahar and Hausmann (2025a) claim to find evidence against the hypothesis that oil sanctions on Venezuela lead to increased migration flows to the United States. We show that their findings derive from applying a nonstandard, misspecified Engle-Granger test to first differences. This specification is incorrect because cointegration tests are designed to evaluate relationships between the levels of variables, not their first differences. Since the residuals from regressions of I(0) variables will, under general conditions, be stationary, testing for cointegration between first differences of I(1) variables virtually ensures a spurious finding of cointegration. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the misspecified Bahar-Hausmann test on first differences exhibits a false positive rate of 100 percent. Once the Engle-Granger test is applied correctly to the logarithms of levels, the evidence of cointegration vanishes. The Bahar-Hausmann regressions therefore provide no valid basis for inference about any underlying relationship between migration and Venezuelan oil revenues.

Result: 引入现实摩擦后，参数保险对风险厌恶者福利更高，赔偿保险不实用时优势明显，无约束时优势消失。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于调和经典保险理论与高风险环境下参数风险转移的应用。

Abstract: In high-risk environments, traditional indemnity insurance is often unaffordable or ineffective, despite its well-known optimality under expected utility. This paper compares excess-of-loss indemnity insurance with parametric insurance within a common mean-variance framework, allowing for fixed costs, heterogeneous premium loadings, and binding budget constraints. We show that, once these realistic frictions are introduced, parametric insurance can yield higher welfare for risk-averse individuals, even under the same utility objective. The welfare advantage arises precisely when indemnity insurance becomes impractical, and disappears once both contracts are unconstrained. Our results help reconcile classical insurance theory with the growing use of parametric risk transfer in high-risk settings.

As an illustrative application, we analyze elite women's bobsleigh data, where performance can be separated into start and riding phases with distinct individual skill inputs. The estimates reveal heterogeneous, task-specific affinities: coordination and complementarity are stronger in the start phase but weaker and more dispersed during riding, underscoring skill-specific heterogeneity in unobserved team affinity.

Abstract: The Peter Principle posits that organizations promoting their best performers risk elevating employees to roles where their competence no longer translates, thereby degrading overall efficiency. We investigate when this dynamic emerges and how to mitigate it using a large-scale agent-based model (ABM) of a five-level hierarchy. Results show the Peter Principle is most pronounced under merit promotion when role requirements change substantially between levels; seniority and random exhibit the weakest Peter effects. Both interventions mitigate performance declines, with merit-with-training particularly effective when skill transfer is limited, and selective demotion restoring agents whose 'true' peak performance is at lower levels.

Abstract: The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was the largest targeted business support program in the United States, yet its firm-level effects remain contested. I link administrative PPP and SBA 7(a) records to a near-universe panel of U.S. employer firms from Dun and Bradstreet, covering roughly 30 million establishments, and evaluate short-run impacts on employment, financial stress, and commercial credit risk. To address non-random take-up, I combine propensity score matching with difference-in-differences on a balanced panel from March to September 2020 and exploit variation in loan holding duration. PPP receipt raises employment by about 0.07 percent on average but improves failure-risk and delinquency-risk percentile rankings by roughly 1.2 and 3.2 points, respectively, with longer loan duration strengthening all three margins. Heterogeneity analysis shows that small-to-medium firms and borrowers with intermediate pre-crisis risk experience the largest gains, while micro firms, very large firms, and highly stressed firms benefit less. Firms without prior 7(a) borrowing relationships realize particularly large credit-score gains. Overall, the evidence indicates that PPP functioned more as a balance-sheet and credit-risk backstop than as a powerful jobs program for the average treated firm. The results highlight how firm structure, pre-crisis financial health, and access to government-backed credit shape the effectiveness of large-scale emergency support.

<details>

Motivation: 探究遗留贷款关系对紧急信贷分配的影响，以及SBA 7(a)项目参与情况是否是PPP项目的途径。

Method: 使用新数据集将SBA贷款记录与超2600万家美国企业微观数据关联，采用熵平衡构建可比反事实组。

Result: 2020年4月项目初期，有7(a)关系企业获贷可能性高约29个百分点；到2021年6月，这种优势基本消失。

Conclusion: 危机响应存在速度与公平的权衡，利用现有信贷渠道加速资金发放但会排除信息不透明借款人，还探讨了未来数字基础设施设计的政策含义。

Abstract: This article examines how legacy lending relationships shape the allocation of emergency credit under severe information frictions. Using a novel dataset linking Small Business Administration (SBA) loan records with Dun and Bradstreet microdata for over 26 million U.S. firms, I investigate whether prior participation in the SBA 7(a) program acted as a gateway to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Employing entropy balancing to construct a strictly comparable counterfactual group, I document a distinct dynamic evolution in credit rationing. In the program's initial "panic phase" in April 2020, banks relied heavily on legacy ties as a screening technology: firms with prior 7(a) relationships were approximately 29 percentage points more likely to receive funding than observationally identical non-7(a) firms. By June 2021, however, this insider advantage had largely vanished, suggesting that policy adjustments and extended timelines eventually mitigated the initial intermediation frictions. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between speed and equity in crisis response. While leveraging existing credit rails accelerates deployment, it systematically excludes informationally opaque borrowers. I discuss policy implications for designing future digital infrastructure to decouple verification from historical lending relationships.

Method: 使用克服可靠单位价值数据缺乏问题的结构识别策略，估计2010 - 2022年出口需求价格弹性。

Result: 法案破坏价格机制，需求弹性降为零，形成‘俘虏市场’；去监管无法恢复市场灵活性；2019年‘华为冲击’作为外部需求激增打破结构刚性。

Conclusion: 冲突矿产法规会导致对简单去监管有抗性的垄断瓶颈。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structural transformation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) tin market induced by the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act. Focusing on the breakdown of the pricing mechanism, we estimate the price elasticity of export demand from 2010 to 2022 using a structural identification strategy that overcomes the lack of reliable unit value data. Our analysis reveals that the regulation effectively destroyed the price mechanism, with demand elasticity dropping to zero. This indicates the formation of a ``captive market'' driven by certification requirements rather than price competitiveness. Crucially, we find strong hysteresis; deregulation alone failed to restore market flexibility. The structural rigidity was finally broken not by policy suspension, but by the 2019 ``Huawei shock,'' an external demand surge that forced supply chain diversification. These findings suggest that conflict mineral regulations can induce monopolistic bottlenecks that are resilient to simple deregulation.

Abstract: This study explores the application of deep learning to improve and automate pollen grain detection and classification in both optical and holographic microscopy images, with a particular focus on veterinary cytology use cases. We used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for the classification task, evaluating their performance across imaging modalities. The models achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% overall accuracy for classification on optical images, whereas the initial performance on greyscale holographic images was substantially lower. We addressed the performance gap issue through dataset expansion using automated labeling and bounding box area enlargement. These techniques, applied to holographic images, improved detection performance from 2.49% to 13.3% mAP50 and classification performance from 42% to 54%. Our work demonstrates that, at least for image classification tasks, it is possible to pair deep learning techniques with cost-effective lensless digital holographic microscopy devices.

Abstract: This paper is about predicting the movement of stock consist of S&P 500 index. Historically there are many approaches have been tried using various methods to predict the stock movement and being used in the market currently for algorithm trading and alpha generating systems using traditional mathematical approaches [1, 2].
  The success of artificial neural network recently created a lot of interest and paved the way to enable prediction using cutting-edge research in the machine learning and deep learning. Some of these papers have done a great job in implementing and explaining benefits of these new technologies. Although most these papers do not go into the complexity of the financial data and mostly utilize single dimension data, still most of these papers were successful in creating the ground for future research in this comparatively new phenomenon. In this paper, I am trying to use multivariate raw data including stock split/dividend events (as-is) present in real-world market data instead of engineered financial data. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), the best-known tool so far for image classification, is used on the multi-dimensional stock numbers taken from the market mimicking them as a vector of historical data matrices (read images) and the model achieves promising results. The predictions can be made stock by stock, i.e., a single stock, sector-wise or for the portfolio of stocks.

Abstract: Product posters blend striking visuals with informative text to highlight the product and capture customer attention. However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users. Experiments demonstrate that AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/JD-GenX/AutoPP

Conclusion: 该工作为基于GPR的缺陷自动检测建立了新范式，在复杂地下环境中兼顾计算效率和高精度。

Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has emerged as a pivotal tool for non-destructive evaluation of subsurface road defects. However, conventional GPR image interpretation remains heavily reliant on subjective expertise, introducing inefficiencies and inaccuracies. This study introduces a comprehensive framework to address these limitations: (1) A DCGAN-based data augmentation strategy synthesizes high-fidelity GPR images to mitigate data scarcity while preserving defect morphology under complex backgrounds; (2) A novel Multi-modal Chain and Global Attention Network (MCGA-Net) is proposed, integrating Multi-modal Chain Feature Fusion (MCFF) for hierarchical multi-scale defect representation and Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) for context-aware feature enhancement; (3) MS COCO transfer learning fine-tunes the backbone network, accelerating convergence and improving generalization. Ablation and comparison experiments validate the framework's efficacy. MCGA-Net achieves Precision (92.8%), Recall (92.5%), and mAP@50 (95.9%). In the detection of Gaussian noise, weak signals and small targets, MCGA-Net maintains robustness and outperforms other models. This work establishes a new paradigm for automated GPR-based defect detection, balancing computational efficiency with high accuracy in complex subsurface environments.

Abstract: Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras, which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, the coarse resolution of high-level features of a specific polyp often leads to inferior results for small objects where detailed information is important. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture, named Gated Progressive Fusion network, to selectively fuse features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way for polyp ReID. On the basis of it, a gated progressive fusion strategy is introduced to achieve layer-wise refinement of semantic information through multi-level feature interactions. Experiments on standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy.

Result: 在匹配质量分数下，语义多样性提升13% - 18%。

Conclusion: 为基于GRPO的图像生成在图像质量和多样性之间建立了新的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly GRPO, improves image generation quality significantly by comparing the relative performance of images generated within the same group. However, in the later stages of training, the model tends to produce homogenized outputs, lacking creativity and visual diversity, which restricts its application scenarios. This issue can be analyzed from both reward modeling and generation dynamics perspectives. First, traditional GRPO relies on single-sample quality as the reward signal, driving the model to converge toward a few high-reward generation modes while neglecting distribution-level diversity. Second, conventional GRPO regularization neglects the dominant role of early-stage denoising in preserving diversity, causing a misaligned regularization budget that limits the achievable quality--diversity trade-off. Motivated by these insights, we revisit the diversity degradation problem from both reward modeling and generation dynamics. At the reward level, we propose a distributional creativity bonus based on semantic grouping. Specifically, we construct a distribution-level representation via spectral clustering over samples generated from the same caption, and adaptively allocate exploratory rewards according to group sizes to encourage the discovery of novel visual modes. At the generation level, we introduce a structure-aware regularization, which enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 13\%--18\% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.

Result: 多个基准实验显示，在全路径准确率和基于树的不一致误差上有持续改进，参数开销极小。

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉语言模型适应结构化分类法提供了高效策略。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn powerful multimodal representations through large-scale image-text pretraining, but adapting them to hierarchical classification is underexplored. Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require full fine-tuning, which is expensive and produces inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels. We propose an efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework that updates a few parameters while enforcing structural consistency. We combine two objectives: Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) aligns predictions along the ground-truth label path for vertical coherence, while Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) encourages consistent predictions among sibling classes. Both losses work in the VLM's shared embedding space and integrate with lightweight LoRA adaptation. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead. Our approach provides an efficient strategy for adapting VLMs to structured taxonomies.

Abstract: While the technology for detecting AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images has advanced rapidly, the field still faces two core issues: poor reproducibility and insufficient gen eralizability, which hinder the practical application of such technologies. This study addresses these challenges by re viewing 7 key papers on AIGC detection, constructing a lightweight test dataset, and reproducing a representative detection method. Through this process, we identify the root causes of the reproducibility dilemma in the field: firstly, papers often omit implicit details such as prepro cessing steps and parameter settings; secondly, most detec tion methods overfit to exclusive features of specific gener ators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images. Experimental results show that basic perfor mance can be reproduced when strictly following the core procedures described in the original papers. However, de tection performance drops sharply when preprocessing dis rupts key features or when testing across different genera tors. This research provides empirical evidence for improv ing the reproducibility of AIGC detection technologies and offers reference directions for researchers to disclose ex perimental details more comprehensively and verify the generalizability of their proposed methods.

Abstract: While large vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong long-context understanding, their prevalent small branches fail on linguistics-photography alignment for a limited window size. We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer. Our work not only provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs but also offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation.

Result: 在NuPrompt基准测试中，TrackTeller持续提升语言定位跟踪性能，平均多目标跟踪准确率相对提升70%，虚警频率降低3.15 - 3.4倍。

Conclusion: TrackTeller框架在动态3D驾驶场景的自然语言目标定位中有效，且性能优于强基线。

Abstract: Understanding natural-language references to objects in dynamic 3D driving scenes is essential for interactive autonomous systems. In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.

Abstract: Recently, a plethora of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to achieve the efficiency, safety, and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). The AVs use a perception system to detect, localize, and identify other vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs to perform safe navigation and decision-making. In this paper, we compare the performance of DL models, including YOLO-NAS and YOLOv8, for a detection-based perception task. We capture a custom dataset and experiment with both DL models using our custom dataset. Our analysis reveals that the YOLOv8s model saves 75% of training time compared to the YOLO-NAS model. In addition, the YOLOv8s model (83%) outperforms the YOLO-NAS model (81%) when the target is to achieve the highest object detection accuracy. These comparative analyses of these new emerging DL models will allow the relevant research community to understand the models' performance under real-world use case scenarios.

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a well-established research area. In contrast, Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) is an emerging field with significant potential. This task is challenging due to the variation in individual handwriting styles. A large and diverse dataset is required to generate realistic handwritten text. However, such datasets are difficult to collect and are not readily available. Bengali is the fifth most spoken language in the world. While several studies exist for languages such as English and Arabic, Bengali handwritten text generation has received little attention. To address this gap, we propose a method for generating Bengali handwritten words. We developed and used a self-collected dataset of Bengali handwriting samples. The dataset includes contributions from approximately five hundred individuals across different ages and genders. All images were pre-processed to ensure consistency and quality. Our approach demonstrates the ability to produce diverse handwritten outputs from input plain text.

Abstract: Multimodal medical imaging provides complementary information that is crucial for accurate delineation of pathology, but the development of deep learning models is limited by the scarcity of large datasets in which different modalities are paired and spatially aligned. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing an Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) that learns a single unified segmentation model from completely separate and unpaired CT and MRI cohorts. The architecture exploits the parameter efficiency and expressive power of Quaternion Neural Networks to construct a shared feature space. At its core is the Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block, a data driven attention module that enables bidirectional knowledge transfer between the two streams. By learning to modulate the flow of information dynamically, the A-QCF block allows the network to exchange abstract modality specific expertise, such as the sharp anatomical boundary information available in CT and the subtle soft tissue contrast provided by MRI. This mutual exchange regularizes and enriches the feature representations of both streams. We validate the framework by jointly training a single model on the unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets. The jointly trained model achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, significantly exceeding the strong unimodal nnU-Net baseline by margins of 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Furthermore, comprehensive explainability analysis using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ confirms that the model correctly focuses on relevant pathological structures, ensuring the learned representations are clinically meaningful. This provides a robust and clinically viable paradigm for unlocking the large unpaired imaging archives that are common in healthcare.

Conclusion: 所提方法可有效解决现有模型在生成视频时间尺度扩展上的局限，生成有意义的长视频序列。

Abstract: Video generation has seen remarkable progresses thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Generating models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and more recently Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, usually of up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure, in order to enable the generation process with inference capabilities. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. In classical approaches when aiming to increase the generated video length, the resulting video quality degrades, particularly when considering generating significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, with each state representing a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. This setup allows for the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies, resulting in meaningful long video sequences.

Conclusion: 提出了一个强大且可推广的框架，用于生成模型的指令驱动微调，实现更好的组合控制和对用户意图的保真度。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for diverse, multi-conditional tasks often suffers from task interference when using monolithic adapters like LoRA. The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本的工具组合方法在医学图像理解中表现不佳，因为医学图像关键信息是空间局部特征，难以仅通过文本融合。

Method: 提出TBF框架，利用现成医学VLM从工具盒中选工具提取临床特征，用TBM通过神经网络计算并融合工具输出，还提出TBM用任意VLM工具选择做预测的策略。

Conclusion: TBF不仅改善了医学成像中的工具使用，还产生更具可解释性、临床相关的预测器。

Abstract: Recent tool-use frameworks powered by vision-language models (VLMs) improve image understanding by grounding model predictions with specialized tools. Broadly, these frameworks leverage VLMs and a pre-specified toolbox to decompose the prediction task into multiple tool calls (often deep learning models) which are composed to make a prediction. The dominant approach to composing tools is using text, via function calls embedded in VLM-generated code or natural language. However, these methods often perform poorly on medical image understanding, where salient information is encoded as spatially-localized features that are difficult to compose or fuse via text alone. To address this, we propose a tool-use framework for medical image understanding called the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), which composes VLM-selected tools using a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM). For a given image and task, TBF leverages an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox that each extract clinically-relevant features. Instead of text-based composition, these tools are composed by the TBM, which computes and fuses the tool outputs using a neural network before outputting the final prediction. We propose a simple and effective strategy for TBMs to make predictions with any arbitrary VLM tool selection. Overall, our framework not only improves tool-use in medical imaging contexts, but also yields more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictors. We evaluate TBF on tasks in histopathology and dermatology and find that these advantages enable our framework to perform on par with or better than deep learning-based classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes. Our code is available at https://github.com/christinaliu2020/tool-bottleneck-framework.

Conclusion: SDSNet框架有效解决了现有子空间聚类方法的扩展性问题，在保证聚类质量的同时提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Subspace clustering methods face inherent scalability limits due to the $O(n^3)$ cost (with $n$ denoting the number of data samples) of constructing full $n\times n$ affinities and performing spectral decomposition. While deep learning-based approaches improve feature extraction, they maintain this computational bottleneck through exhaustive pairwise similarity computations. We propose SDSNet (Scalable Deep Subspace Network), a deep subspace clustering framework that achieves $\mathcal{O}(n)$ complexity through (1) landmark-based approximation, avoiding full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. The framework combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Cell detection in pathological images presents unique challenges due to densely packed objects, subtle inter-class differences, and severe background clutter. In this paper, we propose CellMamba, a lightweight and accurate one-stage detector tailored for fine-grained biomedical instance detection. Built upon a VSSD backbone, CellMamba integrates CellMamba Blocks, which couple either NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) with a novel Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module. TMAC enhances spatial discriminability by splitting channels into two parallel branches, equipped with dual idiosyncratic and one consensus attention map, adaptively fused to preserve local sensitivity and global consistency. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Mamba Head that fuses multi-scale features via learnable weights for robust detection under varying object sizes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets-CoNSeP and CytoDArk0-demonstrate that CellMamba outperforms both CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based baselines in accuracy, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our results validate CellMamba as an efficient and effective solution for high-resolution cell detection.

Result: CCAD在AUC上优于现有方法，收敛更快，贡献新标注DAGM 2007数据集。

Conclusion: CCAD有效结合两种范式优势，提升异常检测性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Anomaly detection holds considerable industrial significance, especially in scenarios with limited anomalous data. Currently, reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation-based approaches are the primary focus. However, unsupervised representation-based methods struggle to extract robust features under domain shift, whereas reconstruction-based methods often suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD). CCAD synergizes the strengths of both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for the reconstruction model. Furthermore, we design an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance both generalization and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC while achieving faster convergence. In addition, we contribute a reorganized and re-annotated version of the DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations to further validate our method's effectiveness. The code for reproducing main results is available at https://github.com/chloeqxq/CCAD.

Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是可预防失明的主要原因之一，但大规模筛查受专家资源有限和图像质量差异制约，需要准确高效的筛查方法。

Result: 融合模型始终优于单个骨干网络，EfficientNet - B0 + DenseNet121融合模型性能最佳，准确率82.89%；三模型融合计算成本高；EfficientNet - B0推理速度最快，Eff+Den融合模型在准确性和延迟上取得较好平衡。

Conclusion: 轻量级特征融合可增强跨异构数据集的泛化能力，支持对准确性和吞吐量要求高的可扩展二元DR筛查工作流程。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, yet large-scale screening is constrained by limited specialist availability and variable image quality across devices and populations. This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\%) and diabetic (82.60\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models have achieved high accuracy in identifying synthetic media, but their decision processes remain largely opaque. In this paper we present a mechanistic interpretability framework for deepfake detection applied to a vision-language model. Our approach combines a sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with a novel forensic manifold analysis that probes how the model's features respond to controlled forensic artifact manipulations. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer, and that the geometric properties of the model's feature manifold, including intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, and feature selectivity, vary systematically with different types of deepfake artifacts. These insights provide a first step toward opening the "black box" of deepfake detectors, allowing us to identify which learned features correspond to specific forensic artifacts and to guide the development of more interpretable and robust models.

Abstract: Detection of various lesions in brain MRI is clinically critical, but challenging due to the diversity of lesions and variability in imaging conditions. Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges. Evaluated on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), our method outperforms 17 SOTA methods, achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC.

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少模型对虚假特征和特定组偏差的依赖，且无需细粒度反馈。

Abstract: In high-stakes domains, small task-specific vision models are crucial due to their low computational requirements and the availability of numerous methods to explain their results. However, these explanations often reveal that the models do not align well with human domain knowledge, relying instead on spurious correlations. This might result in brittle behavior once deployed in the real-world. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that it effectively reduces the model's dependence on spurious features and on group-specific biases, without requiring fine-grained feedback.

Conclusion: LongFly可有效解决无人机长距离视觉语言导航的时空上下文建模问题，提升导航性能。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are crucial tools for post-disaster search and rescue, facing challenges such as high information density, rapid changes in viewpoint, and dynamic structures, especially in long-horizon navigation. However, current UAV vision-and-language navigation(VLN) methods struggle to model long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex environments, resulting in inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning. To this end, we propose LongFly, a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for long-horizon UAV VLN. LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that LongFly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89\% in success rate and 6.33\% in success weighted by path length, consistently across both seen and unseen environments.

Motivation: 现有自监督学习和Vision Transformers方法在3D医学图像应用有困难，标准MAE难以捕捉三维空间关系。

Method: 提出BertsWin混合架构，结合全BERT风格的标记掩码和Swin Transformer窗口，引入结构优先损失函数和GradientConductor优化器。

Result: BertsWin架构相比标准ViT - MAE基线，语义收敛加速5.8倍；结合优化器后，训练轮次减少15倍；在计算量上与稀疏ViT基线相当。

Conclusion: BertsWin架构能在不增加计算负担的情况下，加速语义收敛，显著节省计算资源。

Abstract: The application of self-supervised learning (SSL) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) approaches demonstrates promising results in the field of 2D medical imaging, but the use of these methods on 3D volumetric images is fraught with difficulties. Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.

Method: 将对抗扰动集中在少量高熵标记位置，提出Entropy - bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA)方法。

Result: 选择性攻击能将35 - 49%良性输出转为有害输出，有17 - 26%的可迁移性，EGA攻击成功率达93 - 95%。

Conclusion: 提出的EGA方法揭示了当前VLM安全机制的新弱点。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Real-time, streaming interactive avatars represent a critical yet challenging goal in digital human research. Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming. Moreover, existing interactive approaches are typically limited to head-and-shoulder region, limiting their ability to produce gestures and body motions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

Motivation: 增量学习存在过拟合新数据、遗忘旧数据问题，现有方法忽视结构效率，引发模块特征差异和类不对齐。

Method: 提出SCL - PNC，通过适应层实现按需、低成本骨干扩展，将静态参数ETF框架改进为动态框架；提出并行扩展框架和知识蒸馏算法应对特征漂移。

Result: SCL - PNC能设计动态可扩展ETF分类器解决类不对齐，保证扩展模块间特征一致性。

Conclusion: 实验证明SCL - PNC方法有效且高效。

Abstract: Incremental learning often encounter challenges such as overfitting to new data and catastrophic forgetting of old data. Existing methods can effectively extend the model for new tasks while freezing the parameters of the old model, but ignore the necessity of structural efficiency to lead to the feature difference between modules and the class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. To address these issues, we propose scalable class-incremental learning based on parametric neural collapse (SCL-PNC) that enables demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion by adapt-layer and refines the static into a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework according to incremental class. This method can efficiently handle the model expansion question with the increasing number of categories in real-world scenarios. Additionally, to counteract feature drift in serial expansion models, the parallel expansion framework is presented with a knowledge distillation algorithm to align features across expansion modules. Therefore, SCL-PNC can not only design a dynamic and extensible ETF classifier to address class misalignment due to evolving class distributions, but also ensure feature consistency by an adapt-layer with knowledge distillation between extended modules. By leveraging neural collapse, SCL-PNC induces the convergence of the incremental expansion model through a structured combination of the expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and the parametric ETF classifier. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangchuangxin71-cyber/dynamic_ ETF2.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注自然图像和视频的低光照增强，本文旨在解决动漫风景图像低光照质量退化问题，填补领域空白。

Method: 构建未配对动漫风景数据集，提出基于Relativistic GAN思想的Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU)框架，利用光照不确定性动态调整目标函数。

Result: 通过训练多个版本的EnlightenGANs，DRU框架在感知和美学质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DRU框架为以数据为中心的学习提供了新范式，可应用于潜在的视觉和语言领域。

Abstract: By contrast with the prevailing works of low-light enhancement in natural images and videos, this study copes with the low-illumination quality degradation in anime scenery images to bridge the domain gap. For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective. We hope our framework can expose a novel paradigm of data-centric learning for potential visual and language domains. Code is available.

Result: 在生成和判别视觉语言任务评估中，ALEAHallu能显著缓解幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 提出的ALEAHallu框架有效缓解了视觉语言模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \textbf{A}ctivate-\textbf{L}ocate-\textbf{E}dit \textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations.

Motivation: 将经典NDWT的稳定性、冗余性和平移不变性等特性融入量子计算。

Method: 提出两种量子表述，一是基于epsilon - decimated解释，通过将移位索引提升为量子寄存器等操作实现；二是基于Hadamard测试，用对角相位算子探测小波结构。

Result: 得到冗余小波系数的显式全酉量子表示，可实现相干后处理，能直接获取平移不变的能量尺度图和多尺度谱。

Conclusion: 在量子环境中可利用冗余性和平移不变性，量子NDWT为多尺度量子信号处理提供灵活且有物理意义的基础。

Abstract: The nondecimated or translation-invariant wavelet transform (NDWT) is a central tool in classical multiscale signal analysis, valued for its stability, redundancy, and shift invariance. This paper develops two complementary quantum formulations of the NDWT that embed these classical properties coherently into quantum computation. The first formulation is based on the epsilon-decimated interpretation of the NDWT and realizes all circularly shifted wavelet transforms simultaneously by promoting the shift index to a quantum register and applying controlled circular shifts followed by a wavelet analysis unitary. The resulting construction yields an explicit, fully unitary quantum representation of redundant wavelet coefficients and supports coherent postprocessing, including quantum shrinkage via ancilla-driven completely positive trace preserving maps. The second formulation is based on the Hadamard test and uses diagonal phase operators to probe scale-shift wavelet structure through interference, providing direct access to shift-invariant energy scalograms and multiscale spectra without explicit coefficient reconstruction. Together, these two approaches demonstrate that redundancy and translation invariance can be exploited rather than avoided in the quantum setting. Applications to denoising, feature extraction, and spectral scaling illustrate how quantum NDWTs provide a flexible and physically meaningful foundation for multiscale quantum signal processing.

Method: 提出两项改进：实现基于Ising样本的量子配置恢复（ISQR）例程，使用VQE约束方法分解优化任务。

Result: 在真实量子处理单元（IBM Fez）上的结果表明，定制工作流程在财务表现上与经典方法相当，同时提供更广泛的高质量投资策略。

Conclusion: 此方法为在实际金融应用中从量子优化获取实际优势提供了可行途径。

Abstract: We present a scalable, hardware-aware methodology for extending the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to large, realistic Dynamic Portfolio Optimization (DPO) problems. Building on the scaling strategy from our previous work, where we tailored a VQE workflow to both the DPO formulation and the target QPU, we now put forward two significant advances. The first is the implementation of the Ising Sample-based Quantum Configuration Recovery (ISQR) routine, which improves solution quality in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems. The second is the use of the VQE Constrained method to decompose the optimization task, enabling us to handle DPO instances with more variables than the available qubits on current hardware. These advances, which are broadly applicable to other optimization problems, allow us to address a portfolio with a size relevant to the financial industry, consisting of up to 38 assets and covering the full Spanish stock index (IBEX 35). Our results, obtained on a real Quantum Processing Unit (IBM Fez), show that this tailored workflow achieves financial performance on par with classical methods while delivering a broader set of high-quality investment strategies, demonstrating a viable path towards obtaining practical advantage from quantum optimization in real financial applications.

Conclusion: 基于设备状态的离线和在线学习方法可有效实现TDMR技术中编码方案的重配置，能最大化存储容量和/或最小化译码复杂度。

Abstract: In the age of data revolution, a modern storage~or transmission system typically requires different levels of protection. For example, the coding technique used to fortify data in a modern storage system when the device is fresh cannot be the same as that used when the device ages. Therefore, providing reconfigurable coding schemes and devising an effective way to perform this reconfiguration are key to extending the device lifetime. We focus on constrained coding schemes for the emerging two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) technology. Recently, we have designed efficient lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) coding schemes for various stages of the TDMR device lifetime, focusing on the elimination of isolation patterns, and demonstrated remarkable gains by using them. LOCO codes are naturally reconfigurable, and we exploit this feature in our work. Reconfiguration based on predetermined time stamps, which is what the industry adopts, neglects the actual device status. Instead, we propose offline and online learning methods to perform this task based on the device status. In offline learning, training data is assumed to be available throughout the time span of interest, while in online learning, we only use training data at specific time intervals to make consequential decisions. We fit the training data to polynomial equations that give the bit error rate in terms of TD density, then design an optimization problem in order to reach the optimal reconfiguration decisions to switch from a coding scheme to another. The objective is to maximize the storage capacity and/or minimize the decoding complexity. The problem reduces to a linear programming problem. We show that our solution is the global optimal based on problem characteristics, and we offer various experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in TDMR systems.

Abstract: We introduce a nonparametric model for time-evolving, unobserved probability distributions from discrete-time data consisting of unlabelled partitions. The latent process is a two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, and observations arise via exchangeable sampling. Applications include social and genetic data where only aggregate clustering summaries are observed. To address the intractable likelihood, we develop a tractable inferential framework that avoids label enumeration and direct simulation of the latent state. We exploit a duality between the diffusion and a pure-death process on partitions, together with coagulation operators that encode the effect of new data. These yield closed-form, recursive updates for forward and backward inference. We compute exact posterior distributions of the latent state at arbitrary times and predictive distributions of future or interpolated partitions. This enables online and offline inference and forecasting with full uncertainty quantification, bypassing MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo. Compared to particle filtering, our method achieves higher accuracy, lower variance, and substantial computational gains. We illustrate the methodology with synthetic experiments and a social network application, recovering interpretable patterns in time-varying heterozygosity.

Conclusion: 新的敏感性分析方法可解决隐藏治疗版本混淆问题，为因果推断提供支持。

Abstract: Sensitivity analysis informs causal inference by assessing the sensitivity of conclusions to departures from assumptions. The consistency assumption states that there are no hidden versions of treatment and that the outcome arising naturally equals the outcome arising from intervention. When reasoning about the possibility of consistency violations, it can be helpful to distinguish between covariates and versions of treatment. In the context of surgery, for example, genomic variables are covariates and the skill of a particular surgeon is a version of treatment. There may be hidden versions of treatment, and this paper addresses that concern with a new kind of sensitivity analysis. Whereas many methods for sensitivity analysis are focused on confounding by unmeasured covariates, the methodology of this paper is focused on confounding by hidden versions of treatment. In this paper, new mathematical notation is introduced to support the novel method, and example applications are described.

Abstract: A parametric cluster model is a statistical model providing geometric insights onto the points defining a cluster. The {\em spherical cluster model} (SC) approximates a finite point set $P\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ by a sphere $S(c,r)$ as follows. Taking $r$ as a fraction $η\in(0,1)$ (hyper-parameter) of the std deviation of distances between the center $c$ and the data points, the cost of the SC model is the sum over all data points lying outside the sphere $S$ of their power distance with respect to $S$. The center $c$ of the SC model is the point minimizing this cost. Note that $η=0$ yields the celebrated center of mass used in KMeans clustering. We make three contributions.
  First, we show fitting a spherical cluster yields a strictly convex but not smooth combinatorial optimization problem. Second, we present an exact solver using the Clarke gradient on a suitable stratified cell complex defined from an arrangement of hyper-spheres. Finally, we present experiments on a variety of datasets ranging in dimension from $d=9$ to $d=10,000$, with two main observations. First, the exact algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than BFGS based heuristics for datasets of small/intermediate dimension and small values of $η$, and for high dimensional datasets (say $d>100$) whatever the value of $η$. Second, the center of the SC model behave as a parameterized high-dimensional median.
  The SC model is of direct interest for high dimensional multivariate data analysis, and the application to the design of mixtures of SC will be reported in a companion paper.

Result: 广泛的评估结果表明，该方法显著优于现有方法，平均可调度性提高达84.5%。

Conclusion: LEFT - RS协议能有效提高多核实时系统资源共享的效率和容错能力。

Abstract: Emerging real-time applications have driven the transition to multicore embedded systems, where tasks must share resources due to functional demands and limited availability. These resources, whether local or global, are protected within critical sections to prevent race conditions, with locking protocols ensuring both exclusive access and timing requirements. However, transient faults occurring within critical sections can disrupt execution and propagate errors across multiple tasks. Conventional locking protocols fail to address such faults, and integrating traditional fault tolerance techniques often increases blocking. Recent approaches improve fault recovery through parallel replica execution; however, challenges remain due to sequential accessing, coordination overhead, and susceptibility to common-mode faults. In this paper, we propose a Lock-frEe Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing (LEFT-RS) protocol for multicore real-time systems. LEFT-RS allows tasks to concurrently access and read global resources while entering their critical sections in parallel. Each task can complete its access earlier upon successful execution if other tasks experience faults, thereby improving the efficiency of resource usage. Our design also limits the overhead and enhances fault resilience. We present a comprehensive worst-case response time analysis to ensure timing guarantees. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to an 84.5% improvement in schedulability on average.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) are transforming data-intensive domains, with finance representing a high-stakes environment where transparent and reproducible analysis of heterogeneous signals is essential. Traditional quantitative methods remain vulnerable to survivorship bias, while many AI-driven approaches struggle with signal integration, reproducibility, and computational efficiency. We introduce MASFIN, a modular multi-agent framework that integrates LLMs with structured financial metrics and unstructured news, while embedding explicit bias-mitigation protocols. The system leverages GPT-4.1-nano for reproducability and cost-efficient inference and generates weekly portfolios of 15-30 equities with allocation weights optimized for short-term performance. In an eight-week evaluation, MASFIN delivered a 7.33% cumulative return, outperforming the S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, and Dow Jones benchmarks in six of eight weeks, albeit with higher volatility. These findings demonstrate the promise of bias-aware, generative AI frameworks for financial forecasting and highlight opportunities for modular multi-agent design to advance practical, transparent, and reproducible approaches in quantitative finance.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the problem of restoring linear conservation laws in data-driven linear dynamical models. Given a learned operator $\widehat{A}$ and a full-rank constraint matrix $C$ encoding one or more invariants, we show that the matrix closest to $\widehat{A}$ in the Frobenius norm and satisfying $C^\top A = 0$ is the orthogonal projection $A^\star = \widehat{A} - C(C^\top C)^{-1}C^\top \widehat{A}$. This correction is uniquely defined, low rank and fully determined by the violation $C^\top \widehat{A}$. In the single-invariant case it reduces to a rank-one update. We prove that $A^\star$ enforces exact conservation while minimally perturbing the dynamics, and we verify these properties numerically on a Markov-type example. The projection provides an elementary and general mechanism for embedding exact invariants into any learned linear model.

Abstract: Despite numerous attempts to solve the issue of hallucination since the inception of neural language models, it remains a problem in even frontier large language models today. Why is this the case? We walk through definitions of hallucination used in the literature from a historical perspective up to the current day, and fold them into a single definition of hallucination, wherein different prior definitions focus on different aspects of our definition. At its core, we argue that hallucination is simply inaccurate (internal) world modeling, in a form where it is observable to the user (e.g., stating a fact which contradicts a knowledge base, or producing a summary which contradicts a known source). By varying the reference world model as well as the knowledge conflict policy (e.g., knowledge base vs. in-context), we arrive at the different existing definitions of hallucination present in the literature.
  We argue that this unified view is useful because it forces evaluations to make clear their assumed "world" or source of truth, clarifies what should and should not be called hallucination (as opposed to planning or reward/incentive-related errors), and provides a common language to compare benchmarks and mitigation techniques. Building on this definition, we outline plans for a family of benchmarks in which hallucinations are defined as mismatches with synthetic but fully specified world models in different environments, and sketch out how these benchmarks can use such settings to stress-test and improve the world modeling components of language models.

Abstract: Clinical evidence, derived from rigorous research and data analysis, provides healthcare professionals with reliable scientific foundations for informed decision-making. Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is challenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and time constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes.

TL;DR: 人们过度依赖大语言模型，此前缓解此问题的方法未成功，本文分析原因，发现失败模式存在，不同方法效果不一，提出新评估指标有积极效果，认为教学失败模式可行但需更好方法和指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究此前通过教用户大语言模型失败模式以缓解过度依赖的方法未成功的原因。

Method: 先检查是否因缺乏失败模式导致负面结果，分组评估模型预测；再测试提示和基于嵌入的方法能否发现已知失败；最后提出新的衡量教学有效性的指标并进行用户研究。

Result: 失败模式存在；不同方法效果不一；新指标在用户研究中有积极效果。

Conclusion: 教学失败模式可缓解过度依赖，但需更好的自动发现失败方法和合适的指标。

Abstract: People use large language models (LLMs) when they should not. This is partly because they see LLMs compose poems and answer intricate questions, so they understandably, but incorrectly, assume LLMs won't stumble on basic tasks like simple arithmetic. Prior work has tried to address this by clustering instance embeddings into regions where an LLM is likely to fail and automatically describing patterns in these regions. The found failure patterns are taught to users to mitigate their overreliance. Yet, this approach has not fully succeeded. In this analysis paper, we aim to understand why.
  We first examine whether the negative result stems from the absence of failure patterns. We group instances in two datasets by their meta-labels and evaluate an LLM's predictions on these groups. We then define criteria to flag groups that are sizable and where the LLM is error-prone, and find meta-label groups that meet these criteria. Their meta-labels are the LLM's failure patterns that could be taught to users, so they do exist. We next test whether prompting and embedding-based approaches can surface these known failures. Without this, users cannot be taught about them to reduce their overreliance. We find mixed results across methods, which could explain the negative result. Finally, we revisit the final metric that measures teaching effectiveness. We propose to assess a user's ability to effectively use the given failure patterns to anticipate when an LLM is error-prone. A user study shows a positive effect from teaching with this metric, unlike the human-AI team accuracy. Our findings show that teaching failure patterns could be a viable approach to mitigating overreliance, but success depends on better automated failure-discovery methods and using metrics like ours.

TL;DR: 提出COMETH框架，整合概率上下文学习器、基于大语言模型的语义抽象和人类道德评估，在道德预测上比端到端大语言模型提示法表现更好，还提供了相关数据集和可解释方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过建模来体现背景对模糊道德行为可接受性的影响。

Method: 创建300个场景的数据集，收集人类判断，用大语言模型过滤器和MiniLM嵌入及K - means进行预处理，COMETH通过聚类学习特定行为的道德背景，泛化模块提取特征并学习权重。

Result: COMETH与多数人类判断的一致性约为60%，约是端到端大语言模型提示法（约30%）的两倍，还能揭示驱动预测的背景特征。

Conclusion: 贡献包括基于实证的道德背景数据集、结合人类判断与模型上下文学习及大语言模型语义的可重复流程，以及用于上下文敏感道德预测和解释的可解释替代方法。

Abstract: Moral actions are judged not only by their outcomes but by the context in which they occur. We present COMETH (Contextual Organization of Moral Evaluation from Textual Human inputs), a framework that integrates a probabilistic context learner with LLM-based semantic abstraction and human moral evaluations to model how context shapes the acceptability of ambiguous actions. We curate an empirically grounded dataset of 300 scenarios across six core actions (violating Do not kill, Do not deceive, and Do not break the law) and collect ternary judgments (Blame/Neutral/Support) from N=101 participants. A preprocessing pipeline standardizes actions via an LLM filter and MiniLM embeddings with K-means, producing robust, reproducible core-action clusters. COMETH then learns action-specific moral contexts by clustering scenarios online from human judgment distributions using principled divergence criteria. To generalize and explain predictions, a Generalization module extracts concise, non-evaluative binary contextual features and learns feature weights in a transparent likelihood-based model. Empirically, COMETH roughly doubles alignment with majority human judgments relative to end-to-end LLM prompting (approx. 60% vs. approx. 30% on average), while revealing which contextual features drive its predictions. The contributions are: (i) an empirically grounded moral-context dataset, (ii) a reproducible pipeline combining human judgments with model-based context learning and LLM semantics, and (iii) an interpretable alternative to end-to-end LLMs for context-sensitive moral prediction and explanation.

Conclusion: 研究结果为评估和推进大语言模型的幽默理解提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Humor is a salient testbed for human-like creative thinking in large language models (LLMs). We study humor using the Japanese creative response game Oogiri, in which participants produce witty responses to a given prompt, and ask the following research question: What makes such responses funny to humans? Previous work has offered only limited reliable means to answer this question. Existing datasets contain few candidate responses per prompt, expose popularity signals during ratings, and lack objective and comparable metrics for funniness. Thus, we introduce Oogiri-Master and Oogiri-Corpus, which are a benchmark and dataset designed to enable rigorous evaluation of humor understanding in LLMs. Each prompt is paired with approximately 100 diverse candidate responses, and funniness is rated independently by approximately 100 human judges without access to others' ratings, reducing popularity bias and enabling robust aggregation. Using Oogiri-Corpus, we conduct a quantitative analysis of the linguistic factors associated with funniness, such as text length, ambiguity, and incongruity resolution, and derive objective metrics for predicting human judgments. Subsequently, we benchmark a range of LLMs and human baselines in Oogiri-Master, demonstrating that state-of-the-art models approach human performance and that insight-augmented prompting improves the model performance. Our results provide a principled basis for evaluating and advancing humor understanding in LLMs.

Abstract: Human conversation is organized by an implicit chain of thoughts that manifests as timed speech acts. Capturing this causal pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that enables reasoning over conversational behaviors by modeling this process as causal inference within a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a hybrid corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich simulations with human-annotated rationales and real conversational speech. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a multimodal transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems.

Motivation: 大语言模型可能被滥用，现有检测研究中孟加拉语领域探索较少，其语言特点使检测更具挑战性，因此有必要开展研究。

Method: 研究五种基于Transformer的模型，进行零样本评估和任务特定微调。

Result: 零样本评估中各模型准确率约50%，微调后XLM - RoBERTa、mDeBERTa和MultilingualBERT在准确率和F1分数上达约91%，IndicBERT表现较弱。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了孟加拉语AI生成文本检测，为构建对抗AI生成内容的强大系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can produce text that closely resembles human writing. This capability raises concerns about misuse, including disinformation and content manipulation. Detecting AI-generated text is essential to maintain authenticity and prevent malicious applications. Existing research has addressed detection in multiple languages, but the Bengali language remains largely unexplored. Bengali's rich vocabulary and complex structure make distinguishing human-written and AI-generated text particularly challenging. This study investigates five transformer-based models: XLMRoBERTa-Large, mDeBERTaV3-Base, BanglaBERT-Base, IndicBERT-Base and MultilingualBERT-Base. Zero-shot evaluation shows that all models perform near chance levels (around 50% accuracy) and highlight the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Fine-tuning significantly improves performance, with XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa and MultilingualBERT achieving around 91% on both accuracy and F1-score. IndicBERT demonstrates comparatively weaker performance, indicating limited effectiveness in fine-tuning for this task. This work advances AI-generated text detection in Bengali and establishes a foundation for building robust systems to counter AI-generated content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在标记增强大语言模型推理的内部机制不明，需从可靠性角度研究。

Method: 采用两种互补方法，一是对特定标记子集进行扰动的转向实验，二是在有偏差和分布外设置下评估模型的捷径实验。

Result: COCONUT标记对转向不敏感且缺乏推理关键信息，在MMLU和HotpotQA上利用数据集伪迹夸大基准性能。

Conclusion: COCONUT是伪推理机制，生成看似合理的痕迹却隐藏了对捷径的依赖。

Abstract: Latent tokens are gaining attention for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their internal mechanisms remain unclear. This paper examines the problem from a reliability perspective, uncovering fundamental weaknesses: latent tokens function as uninterpretable placeholders rather than encoding faithful reasoning. While resistant to perturbation, they promote shortcut usage over genuine reasoning. We focus on Chain-of-Continuous-Thought (COCONUT), which claims better efficiency and stability than explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while maintaining performance. We investigate this through two complementary approaches. First, steering experiments perturb specific token subsets, namely COCONUT and explicit CoT. Unlike CoT tokens, COCONUT tokens show minimal sensitivity to steering and lack reasoning-critical information. Second, shortcut experiments evaluate models under biased and out-of-distribution settings. Results on MMLU and HotpotQA demonstrate that COCONUT consistently exploits dataset artifacts, inflating benchmark performance without true reasoning. These findings reposition COCONUT as a pseudo-reasoning mechanism: it generates plausible traces that conceal shortcut dependence rather than faithfully representing reasoning processes.

Result: 在多领域客户对话基准DSTC - 12上，8B大语言模型的CATCH在主题聚类和主题生成质量上表现有效。

Conclusion: CATCH框架能有效解决现有主题检测方法面临的挑战。

Abstract: Theme detection is a fundamental task in user-centric dialogue systems, aiming to identify the latent topic of each utterance without relying on predefined schemas. Unlike intent induction, which operates within fixed label spaces, theme detection requires cross-dialogue consistency and alignment with personalized user preferences, posing significant challenges. Existing methods often struggle with sparse, short utterances for accurate topic representation and fail to capture user-level thematic preferences across dialogues. To address these challenges, we propose CATCH (Controllable Theme Detection with Contextualized Clustering and Hierarchical Generation), a unified framework that integrates three core components: (1) context-aware topic representation, which enriches utterance-level semantics using surrounding topic segments; (2) preference-guided topic clustering, which jointly models semantic proximity and personalized feedback to align themes across dialogue; and (3) a hierarchical theme generation mechanism designed to suppress noise and produce robust, coherent topic labels. Experiments on a multi-domain customer dialogue benchmark (DSTC-12) demonstrate the effectiveness of CATCH with 8B LLM in both theme clustering and topic generation quality.

Abstract: Between 2021 and 2025, the SciCap project grew from a small seed-funded idea at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) into one of the central efforts shaping the scientific figure-captioning landscape. Supported by a Penn State seed grant, Adobe, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, what began as our attempt to test whether domain-specific training, which was successful in text models like SciBERT, could also work for figure captions expanded into a multi-institution collaboration. Over these five years, we curated, released, and continually updated a large collection of figure-caption pairs from arXiv papers, conducted extensive automatic and human evaluations on both generated and author-written captions, navigated the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), launched annual challenges, and built interactive systems that help scientists write better captions. In this piece, we look back at the first five years of SciCap and summarize the key technical and methodological lessons we learned. We then outline five major unsolved challenges and propose directions for the next phase of research in scientific figure captioning.

Conclusion: HeartBench 为拟人化人工智能评估建立了标准化指标，并为构建高质量、符合人类需求的训练数据提供了方法蓝图。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in cognitive and reasoning benchmarks, they exhibit a persistent deficit in anthropomorphic intelligence-the capacity to navigate complex social, emotional, and ethical nuances. This gap is particularly acute in the Chinese linguistic and cultural context, where a lack of specialized evaluation frameworks and high-quality socio-emotional data impedes progress. To address these limitations, we present HeartBench, a framework designed to evaluate the integrated emotional, cultural, and ethical dimensions of Chinese LLMs. Grounded in authentic psychological counseling scenarios and developed in collaboration with clinical experts, the benchmark is structured around a theory-driven taxonomy comprising five primary dimensions and 15 secondary capabilities. We implement a case-specific, rubric-based methodology that translates abstract human-like traits into granular, measurable criteria through a ``reasoning-before-scoring'' evaluation protocol. Our assessment of 13 state-of-the-art LLMs indicates a substantial performance ceiling: even leading models achieve only 60% of the expert-defined ideal score. Furthermore, analysis using a difficulty-stratified ``Hard Set'' reveals a significant performance decay in scenarios involving subtle emotional subtexts and complex ethical trade-offs. HeartBench establishes a standardized metric for anthropomorphic AI evaluation and provides a methodological blueprint for constructing high-quality, human-aligned training data.

Conclusion: 开发具备版权意识的大视觉语言模型对合法使用版权内容至关重要。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, their widespread accessibility raises critical concerns about potential copyright infringement. Will LVLMs accurately recognize and comply with copyright regulations when encountering copyrighted content (i.e., user input, retrieved documents) in the context? Failure to comply with copyright regulations may lead to serious legal and ethical consequences, particularly when LVLMs generate responses based on copyrighted materials (e.g., retrieved book experts, news reports). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various LVLMs, examining how they handle copyrighted content -- such as book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation when they are presented as visual inputs. To systematically measure copyright compliance, we introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LVLMs handle queries that could lead to copyright infringement. Given that real-world copyrighted content may or may not include a copyright notice, the dataset includes query-content pairs in two distinct scenarios: with and without a copyright notice. For the former, we extensively cover four types of copyright notices to account for different cases. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting the copyrighted content, even when presented with the copyright notice. To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance, which reduces infringement risks in all scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of developing copyright-aware LVLMs to ensure the responsible and lawful use of copyrighted content.

Abstract: Cricket is the second most popular sport globally, commanding a massive following of over 2.5 billion fans globally. Enthusiasts and analysts frequently seek advanced statistical insights, such as long-term historical performance trends or complex player comparisons, that are often unavailable through standard web searches. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in Text-to-SQL tasks, their capability to handle the domain-specific nuances, complex schema variations, and multilingual requirements inherent to sports analytics remains under-explored. To investigate this potential capability gap, we present CricBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs on specialized cricket data. To curate a "Gold Standard" dataset, we collaborate with domain experts in cricket and SQL to manually author complex queries, ensuring logical correctness. Recognizing linguistic diversity, we construct the benchmark in both English and Hindi, establishing a framework that is open for further extension to other regional languages. We evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and open-source models, using a strict evaluation protocol. Our results reveal that high performance on general benchmarks does not guarantee success in specialized domains. While the open-weights reasoning model DeepSeek R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance (50.6%), surpassing proprietary giants like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (47.7%) and GPT-4o (33.7%), it still exhibits a significant accuracy drop when moving from general benchmarks (BIRD) to CricBench. Furthermore, we observe that code-mixed Hindi queries frequently yield parity or higher accuracy compared to English, challenging the assumption that English is the optimal prompt language for specialized SQL tasks.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of various model architectures, such as transformers, large language models (LLMs), and other NLP systems, requires comprehensive benchmarks that measure performance across multiple dimensions. Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow. With TrGLUE, our goal is to establish a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, empower researchers with valuable resources, and provide insights into generating high-quality semi-automated datasets.

Conclusion: 可进一步开发支持大规模机器学习训练，用于离散优化和量子多体模拟的实际应用。

Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as effective solvers for combinatorial optimization problems, such as NP-hard problems, machine learning, and financial modeling. Recent spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) excel in multi-node optimization and spin glass simulations, leveraging their large-scale and fully connected characteristics. However, existing laser diffraction-based SPIMs usually sacrifice time efficiency or spin count to encode high-rank spin-spin coupling and external fields, limiting their scalability for real-world applications. Here, we demonstrate an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) with 200 iterations per second. By re-formulating an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian as the sum of Hadamard products, followed by loading the corresponding matrices/vectors onto an aligned amplitude spatial light modulator and digital micro-mirrors device, we directly map a 797-spin Ising model with external fields (nearly 9-bit precision, -255 to 255) into an incoherent light field, eliminating the need for repeated and auxiliary operations. Serving as encoding accuracy metrics, the linear coefficient of determination and Pearson correlation coefficient between measured light intensities and Ising Hamiltonians exceed 0.9800, with values exceed 0.9997 globally. The AR-SPIM achieves less than 0.3% error rate for ground-state search of biased Max-cut problems with arbitrary ranks and weights, enables complex phase transition observations, and facilitates scalable spin counts for sparse Ising problems via removing zero-valued Hadamard product terms. This reconfigurable AR-SPIM can be further developed to support large-scale machine-learning training and deployed for practical applications in discrete optimization and quantum many-body simulations.

This interdisciplinary approach, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), can be seen as an algebraic dual to the traditional set-theoretic framework of the DS theory, with its algebraic structure enabling the extension of some DS theory concepts to stochastic dynamics. Moreover, it reveals the presence of a topological supersymmetry (TS) in the GTOs of all SDEs. It also shows that among the various definitions of chaos, positive "pressure", defined as the logarithm of the GTO spectral radius, stands out as particularly meaningful from a physical perspective, as it corresponds to the spontaneous breakdown of TS on the TFT side. Via the Goldstone theorem, this definition has a potential to provide the long-sought explanation for the experimental signature of chaotic dynamics known as 1/f noise. Additionally, STS clarifies that among the various existing interpretations of SDEs, only the Stratonovich interpretation yields evolution operators that match the corresponding GTOs and, consequently, have a clear-cut mathematical meaning. Here, we discuss these and other aspects of STS from both the DS theory and TFT perspectives, focusing on links between these two fields and providing mathematical concepts with physical interpretations that may be useful in some contexts.

Motivation: 传统市场机制在频谱等资源分配中存在问题，如可能干扰非商业机构使命，且存在信息不对称，需确定无直接货币转移下的有效资源分配方式。

Conclusion: 未明确给出结论。

Abstract: The radio spectrum suitable for commercial wireless services is limited. A portion of the radio spectrum has been reserved for institutions using it for non-commercial purposes such as federal agencies, defense, public safety bodies and scientific institutions. In order to operate efficiently, these incumbents need clean spectrum access. However, commercial users also want access, and granting them access may materially interfere with the existing activity of the incumbents. Conventional market based mechanisms for allocating scarce resources in this context are problematic. Allowing direct monetary transfers to and from public or scientific institutions risks distorting their non-commercial mission. Moreover, often only the incumbent knows the exact value of the interference it experiences, and, likewise, only commercial users can predict accurately the expected monetary outcome from sharing the resource. Thus, our problem is to determine the efficient allocation of resources in the presence of private information without the use of direct monetary transfers. The problem is not unique to spectrum. Other resources that governments hold in trust share the same feature. We propose a novel mechanism design formulation of the problem, characterize the optimal mechanism and describe some of its qualitative properties.

Result: （i）在独立同分布无偏情况和任意平局决胜规则下，证明只有独裁是自我维持的，其他SCF会趋向独裁；（ii）考虑群体智慧效应时，社会中稳定的统治精英规模与经济榨取程度和个人决策质量负相关。

Conclusion: 为集中化动态和稳定性提供了基本框架与结果，适用于机构设计，特别是区块链DAO等正式系统。

Abstract: Consider a social-choice function (SCF) is chosen to decide votes in a formal system, including votes to replace the voting method itself. Agents vote according to their ex-ante preference between the incumbent SCF and the suggested replacement. The existing SCF then aggregates the agents' votes and arrives at a decision of whether it should itself be replaced. An SCF is self-maintaining if it can not be replaced in such fashion by any other SCF. Our focus is on the implications of self-maintenance for centralization. We present results considering optimistic, pessimistic and i.i.d. approaches w.r.t. agent beliefs, and different tie-breaking rules. To highlight two of the results, (i) for the i.i.d. unbiased case with arbitrary tie-breaking, we prove an ``Arrow-Style'' Theorem for Dynamics: We show that only a dictatorship is self-maintaining, and any other SCF has a path of changes that arrives at a dictatorship. (ii) If we take into account wisdom of the crowd effects, for a society with a variable size of ruling elite, we demonstrate how the stable elite size is decreasing in both how extractive the economy is, and the quality of individual decision-making. All in all we provide a basic framework and body of results for centralization dynamics and stability, applicable for institution design, especially in formal ``De-Jure'' systems, such as Blockchain Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming education, offering unprecedented opportunities to personalize learning, enhance assessment, and support educators. Yet these opportunities also introduce risks related to equity, privacy, and student autonomy. This chapter develops the concept of bidirectional human-AI alignment in education, emphasizing that trustworthy learning environments arise not only from embedding human values into AI systems but also from equipping teachers, students, and institutions with the skills to interpret, critique, and guide these technologies. Drawing on emerging research and practical case examples, we explore AI's evolution from support tool to collaborative partner, highlighting its impacts on teacher roles, student agency, and institutional governance. We propose actionable strategies for policymakers, developers, and educators to ensure that AI advances equity, transparency, and human flourishing rather than eroding them. By reframing AI adoption as an ongoing process of mutual adaptation, the chapter envisions a future in which humans and intelligent systems learn, innovate, and grow together.

Motivation: 能耗决定部署大语言模型的成本和环境影响，需研究SRAM大小和工作频率对能效和性能的影响。

Result: 总能耗主要由SRAM大小决定，高频率可降低总能耗，找到高频率和小缓存的最佳配置。

Conclusion: 为设计高能效LLM加速器提供架构见解，助力数据中心降低能耗。

Abstract: Energy consumption dictates the cost and environmental impact of deploying Large Language Models. This paper investigates the impact of on-chip SRAM size and operating frequency on the energy efficiency and performance of LLM inference, focusing on the distinct behaviors of the compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode phases. Our simulation methodology combines OpenRAM for energy modeling, LLMCompass for latency simulation, and ScaleSIM for systolic array operational intensity. Our findings show that total energy use is predominantly determined by SRAM size in both phases, with larger buffers significantly increasing static energy due to leakage, which is not offset by corresponding latency benefits. We quantitatively explore the memory-bandwidth bottleneck, demonstrating that while high operating frequencies reduce prefill latency, their positive impact on memory-bound decode latency is capped by the external memory bandwidth. Counter-intuitively, high compute frequency can reduce total energy by reducing execution time and consequently decreasing static energy consumption more than the resulting dynamic power increase. We identify an optimal hardware configuration for the simulated workload: high operating frequencies (1200MHz-1400MHz) and a small local buffer size of 32KB to 64KB. This combination achieves the best energy-delay product, balancing low latency with high energy efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how memory bandwidth acts as a performance ceiling, and that increasing compute frequency only yields performance gains up to the point where the workload becomes memory-bound. This analysis provides concrete architectural insights for designing energy-efficient LLM accelerators, especially for datacenters aiming to minimize their energy overhead.

Result: 在1到12个月的预测期内，DynAttn预测准确性更高，在稀疏网格级设置中优势明显

Conclusion: DynAttn不仅有更好的预测性能，还能对地区冲突动态进行结构化解读

Abstract: Forecasting conflict-related fatalities remains a central challenge in political science and policy analysis due to the sparse, bursty, and highly non-stationary nature of violence data. We introduce DynAttn, an interpretable dynamic-attention forecasting framework for high-dimensional spatio-temporal count processes. DynAttn combines rolling-window estimation, shared elastic-net feature gating, a compact weight-tied self-attention encoder, and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) likelihood. This architecture produces calibrated multi-horizon forecasts of expected casualties and exceedance probabilities, while retaining transparent diagnostics through feature gates, ablation analysis, and elasticity measures.
  We evaluate DynAttn using global country-level and high-resolution PRIO-grid-level conflict data from the VIEWS forecasting system, benchmarking it against established statistical and machine-learning approaches, including DynENet, LSTM, Prophet, PatchTST, and the official VIEWS baseline. Across forecast horizons from one to twelve months, DynAttn consistently achieves substantially higher predictive accuracy, with particularly large gains in sparse grid-level settings where competing models often become unstable or degrade sharply.
  Beyond predictive performance, DynAttn enables structured interpretation of regional conflict dynamics. In our application, cross-regional analyses show that short-run conflict persistence and spatial diffusion form the core predictive backbone, while climate stress acts either as a conditional amplifier or a primary driver depending on the conflict theater.

Abstract: Advances in automated systems afford new opportunities for intelligent management of energy at household, local area, and utility scales. Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) can play a role by optimizing the schedule and use of household energy devices and resources. One challenge is that the goals of a household can be complex and conflicting. For example, a household might wish to reduce energy costs and grid-associated greenhouse gas emissions, yet keep room temperatures comfortable. Another challenge is that an intelligent HEMS agent must make decisions under uncertainty. An agent must plan actions into the future, but weather and solar generation forecasts, for example, provide inherently uncertain estimates of future conditions. This paper introduces EcoNet, a Bayesian approach to household and neighborhood energy management that is based on active inference. The aim is to improve energy management and coordination, while accommodating uncertainties and taking into account potentially conditional and conflicting goals and preferences. Simulation results are presented and discussed.

Motivation: SAGIN - 使能的MC因TN和NTN的异构性带来复杂架构挑战，传统方法难以解决最优资源分配问题，需探索有效方法。

Method: 回顾SAGIN - 使能的MC当前发展，提出AI驱动方法，进行基于智能体强化学习的资源分配优化案例研究。

Result: 学习方法能有效处理复杂场景，显著提升网络延迟和容量性能，代价是功耗适度增加。

Conclusion: AI驱动方法对SAGIN - 使能的MC资源优化有潜力，需进一步研究解决开放问题以实现高效SAGIN - 使能的MC。

Abstract: Space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN)-enabled multiconnectivity (MC) is emerging as a key enabler for next-generation networks, enabling users to simultaneously utilize multiple links across multi-layer non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and multi-radio access technology (multi-RAT) terrestrial networks (TN). However, the heterogeneity of TN and NTN introduces complex architectural challenges that complicate MC implementation. Specifically, the diversity of link types, spanning air-to-air, air-to-space, space-to-space, space-to-ground, and ground-to-ground communications, renders optimal resource allocation highly complex. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) have shown remarkable effectiveness in optimal decision-making in complex and dynamic environments. In this paper, we review the current developments in SAGIN-enabled MC and outline the key challenges associated with its implementation. We further highlight the transformative potential of AI-driven approaches for resource optimization in a heterogeneous SAGIN environment. To this end, we present a case study on resource allocation optimization enabled by agentic RL for SAGIN-enabled MC involving diverse radio access technologies (RATs). Results show that learning-based methods can effectively handle complex scenarios and substantially enhance network performance in terms of latency and capacity while incurring a moderate increase in power consumption as an acceptable tradeoff. Finally, open research problems and future directions are presented to realize efficient SAGIN-enabled MC.

Motivation: 传统切换易出现故障和延迟，两类切换在信令、资源使用和可靠性方面有复杂权衡，需要自适应和强大的切换控制。

Method: 提出 CONTRA 框架，研究两种变体，采用实用元学习算法适应运行时观察。

Result: 基于众包数据集评估，CONTRA 提升用户吞吐量，降低切换成本，在动态和现实场景中优于 3GPP 合规与强化学习基线。

Conclusion: CONTRA 框架可在近实时部署为 O - RAN xApp，符合 6G 灵活智能控制目标。

Abstract: While traditional handovers (THOs) have served as a backbone for mobile connectivity, they increasingly suffer from failures and delays, especially in dense deployments and high-frequency bands. To address these limitations, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handovers (CHOs) that enable proactive cell reservations and user-driven execution. However, both handover (HO) types present intricate trade-offs in signaling, resource usage, and reliability. This paper presents unique, countrywide mobility management datasets from a top-tier mobile network operator (MNO) that offer fresh insights into these issues and call for adaptive and robust HO control in next-generation networks. Motivated by these findings, we propose CONTRA, a framework that, for the first time, jointly optimizes THOs and CHOs within the O-RAN architecture. We study two variants of CONTRA: one where users are a priori assigned to one of the HO types, reflecting distinct service or user-specific requirements, as well as a more dynamic formulation where the controller decides on-the-fly the HO type, based on system conditions and needs. To this end, it relies on a practical meta-learning algorithm that adapts to runtime observations and guarantees performance comparable to an oracle with perfect future information (universal no-regret). CONTRA is specifically designed for near-real-time deployment as an O-RAN xApp and aligns with the 6G goals of flexible and intelligent control. Extensive evaluations leveraging crowdsourced datasets show that CONTRA improves user throughput and reduces both THO and CHO switching costs, outperforming 3GPP-compliant and Reinforcement Learning (RL) baselines in dynamic and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 双模式xVFA以紧凑且经济有效的光学传感器形式，实现了即时、快速的心血管疾病定量诊断。

Abstract: Rapid and accessible cardiac biomarker testing is essential for the timely diagnosis and risk assessment of myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF), two interrelated conditions that frequently coexist and drive recurrent hospitalizations with high mortality. However, current laboratory and point-of-care testing systems are limited by long turnaround times, narrow dynamic ranges for the tested biomarkers, and single-analyte formats that fail to capture the complexity of cardiovascular disease. Here, we present a deep learning-enhanced dual-mode multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA) with a portable optical reader and a neural network-based quantification pipeline. This optical sensor integrates colorimetric and chemiluminescent detection within a single paper-based cartridge to complementarily cover a large dynamic range (spanning ~6 orders of magnitude) for both low- and high-abundance biomarkers, while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Using 50 uL of serum, the optical sensor simultaneously quantifies cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) within 23 min. The xVFA achieves sub-pg/mL sensitivity for cTnI and sub-ng/mL sensitivity for CK-MB and NT-proBNP, spanning the clinically relevant ranges for these biomarkers. Neural network models trained and blindly tested on 92 patient serum samples yielded a robust quantification performance (Pearson's r > 0.96 vs. reference assays). By combining high sensitivity, multiplexing, and automation in a compact and cost-effective optical sensor format, the dual-mode xVFA enables rapid and quantitative cardiovascular diagnostics at the point of care.

Abstract: Financial firms and institutional investors are routinely evaluated based on their performance relative to their peers. These relative performance concerns significantly influence risk-taking behavior and market dynamics. While the literature studying Nash equilibrium under such relative performance competitions is extensive, its effect on asset price formation remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates mean-field equilibrium price formation of a single risky stock in a discrete-time market where agents exhibit exponential utility and relative performance concerns. Unlike existing literature that typically treats asset prices as exogenous, we impose a market-clearing condition to determine the price dynamics endogenously within a relative performance equilibrium. Using a binomial tree framework, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the market-clearing mean-field equilibrium in both single- and multi-population settings. Finally, we provide illustrative numerical examples demonstrating the equilibrium price distributions and agents' optimal position sizes.

Conclusion: Reflection - Driven Control是实现可信AI编码代理的实用途径，能实现自主、构建安全且可审计的设计。

Abstract: Contemporary large language model (LLM) agents are remarkably capable, but they still lack reliable safety controls and can produce unconstrained, unpredictable, and even actively harmful outputs. To address this, we introduce Reflection-Driven Control, a standardized and pluggable control module that can be seamlessly integrated into general agent architectures. Reflection-Driven Control elevates "self-reflection" from a post hoc patch into an explicit step in the agent's own reasoning process: during generation, the agent continuously runs an internal reflection loop that monitors and evaluates its own decision path. When potential risks are detected, the system retrieves relevant repair examples and secure coding guidelines from an evolving reflective memory, injecting these evidence-based constraints directly into subsequent reasoning steps. We instantiate Reflection-Driven Control in the setting of secure code generation and systematically evaluate it across eight classes of security-critical programming tasks. Empirical results show that Reflection-Driven Control substantially improves the security and policy compliance of generated code while largely preserving functional correctness, with minimal runtime and token overhead. Taken together, these findings indicate that Reflection-Driven Control is a practical path toward trustworthy AI coding agents: it enables designs that are simultaneously autonomous, safer by construction, and auditable.

Conclusion: 检索器后门攻击是软件开发生态的实际威胁，当前防御手段无法应对，需强大安全措施。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is increasingly adopted to enhance Large Language Models for software development, yet its security implications remain dangerously underexplored. This paper conducts the first systematic exploration of a critical and stealthy threat: backdoor attacks targeting the retriever component, which represents a significant supply-chain vulnerability. It is infeasible to assess this threat realistically, as existing attack methods are either too ineffective to pose a real danger or are easily detected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms spanning both latent-space analysis and token-level inspection, which achieve consistently high detection rates. To overcome this barrier and enable a realistic analysis, we first developed VenomRACG, a new class of potent and stealthy attack that serves as a vehicle for our investigation. Its design makes poisoned samples statistically indistinguishable from benign code, allowing the attack to consistently maintain low detectability across all evaluated defense mechanisms. Armed with this capability, our exploration reveals a severe vulnerability: by injecting vulnerable code equivalent to only 0.05% of the entire knowledge base size, an attacker can successfully manipulate the backdoored retriever to rank the vulnerable code in its top-5 results in 51.29% of cases. This translates to severe downstream harm, causing models like GPT-4o to generate vulnerable code in over 40% of targeted scenarios, while leaving the system's general performance intact. Our findings establish that retriever backdooring is not a theoretical concern but a practical threat to the software development ecosystem that current defenses are blind to, highlighting the urgent need for robust security measures.

Abstract: The rapid growth in both the scale and complexity of Android malware has driven the widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques for scalable and accurate malware detection. Despite their effectiveness, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that introduce carefully crafted feature-level perturbations to evade detection while preserving malicious functionality. In this paper, we present LAMLAD, a novel adversarial attack framework that exploits the generative and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to bypass ML-based Android malware classifiers. LAMLAD employs a dual-agent architecture composed of an LLM manipulator, which generates realistic and functionality-preserving feature perturbations, and an LLM analyzer, which guides the perturbation process toward successful evasion. To improve efficiency and contextual awareness, LAMLAD integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into the LLM pipeline. Focusing on Drebin-style feature representations, LAMLAD enables stealthy and high-confidence attacks against widely deployed Android malware detection systems. We evaluate LAMLAD against three representative ML-based Android malware detectors and compare its performance with two state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods. Experimental results demonstrate that LAMLAD achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of up to 97%, requiring on average only three attempts per adversarial sample, highlighting its effectiveness, efficiency, and adaptability in practical adversarial settings. Furthermore, we propose an adversarial training-based defense strategy that reduces the ASR by more than 30% on average, significantly enhancing model robustness against LAMLAD-style attacks.

However, this fast development has prompted increased scrutiny concerning user privacy and the use of copyrighted works in training. A recent attack on machine-learning models called membership inference lies at the crossroads of these two concerns. The attack is given as input a set of records and a trained model and seeks to identify which of those records may have been used to train the model. On one hand, this attack can be used to identify user data used to train a model, which may violate their privacy especially in sensitive applications such as models trained on medical data. On the other hand, this attack can be used by rights-holders as evidence that a company used their works without permission to train a model.
  Remarkably, it appears that no work has studied the effect of membership inference attacks (MIA) on generative music. Given that the music industry is worth billions of dollars and artists would stand to gain from being able to determine if their works were being used without permission, we believe this is a pressing issue to study. As such, in this work we begin a preliminary study into whether MIAs are effective on generative music. We study the effect of several existing attacks on MuseGAN, a popular and influential generative music model. Similar to prior work on generative audio MIAs, our findings suggest that music data is fairly resilient to known membership inference techniques.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of temperature evolution is essential for understanding thermomechanical behavior in friction stir welding. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed using LAMMPS to model aluminum friction stir welding at the atomic scale, capturing material flow, plastic deformation, and heat generation during tool plunge, traverse, and retraction. Atomic positions and velocities were extracted from simulation trajectories and transformed into physics based two dimensional spatial grids. These grids represent local height variation, velocity components, velocity magnitude, and atomic density, preserving spatial correlations within the weld zone. A two-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to predict temperature directly from the spatially resolved atomistic data. Hyperparameter optimization was carried out to determine an appropriate network configuration. The trained model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving a coefficient of determination R square of 0.9439, a root mean square error of 14.94 K, and a mean absolute error of 11.58 K on unseen test data. Class Activation Map analysis indicates that the model assigns higher importance to regions near the tool material interface, which are associated with intense deformation and heat generation in the molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that spatial learning from atomistic simulation data can accurately reproduce temperature trends in friction stir welding while remaining consistent with physical deformation and flow mechanisms observed at the atomic scale.

Abstract: The rapid growth of speech synthesis and voice conversion systems has made deepfake audio a major security concern. Bengali deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study automatic detection of Bengali audio deepfakes using the BanglaFake dataset. We evaluate zeroshot inference with several pretrained models. These include Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53, Whisper, PANNsCNN14, WavLM and Audio Spectrogram Transformer. Zero-shot results show limited detection ability. The best model, Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53, achieves 53.80% accuracy, 56.60% AUC and 46.20% EER. We then f ine-tune multiple architectures for Bengali deepfake detection. These include Wav2Vec2-Base, LCNN, LCNN-Attention, ResNet18, ViT-B16 and CNN-BiLSTM. Fine-tuned models show strong performance gains. ResNet18 achieves the highest accuracy of 79.17%, F1 score of 79.12%, AUC of 84.37% and EER of 24.35%. Experimental results confirm that fine-tuning significantly improves performance over zero-shot inference. This study provides the first systematic benchmark of Bengali deepfake audio detection. It highlights the effectiveness of f ine-tuned deep learning models for this low-resource language.

TL;DR: 提出语义感知音频编解码器SemDAC，以语义码本为语音压缩先验，高效且识别效果好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音编解码器为保真分配大量比特，导致压缩效率低和下游识别任务性能不佳。

Method: 提出SemDAC，首个量化器从HuBERT特征提取语义标记，后续量化器建模残留声学，FiLM条件解码器根据语义标记重建音频。

Result: SemDAC在感知指标上优于DAC，在重建语音上运行Whisper时WER更低，且比特率低。

Conclusion: 语义码本为神经语音压缩提供有效归纳偏置，能生成紧凑且利于识别的表示。

Abstract: Speech codecs are traditionally optimized for waveform fidelity, allocating bits to preserve acoustic detail even when much of it can be inferred from linguistic structure. This leads to inefficient compression and suboptimal performance on downstream recognition tasks. We propose SemDAC, a semantic-aware neural audio codec that leverages semantic codebooks as effective priors for speech compression. In SemDAC, the first quantizer in a residual vector quantization (RVQ) stack is distilled from HuBERT features to produce semantic tokens that capture phonetic content, while subsequent quantizers model residual acoustics. A FiLM-conditioned decoder reconstructs audio conditioned on the semantic tokens, improving efficiency in the use of acoustic codebooks. Despite its simplicity, this design proves highly effective: SemDAC outperforms DAC across perceptual metrics and achieves lower WER when running Whisper on reconstructed speech, all while operating at substantially lower bitrates (e.g., 0.95 kbps vs. 2.5 kbps for DAC). These results demonstrate that semantic codebooks provide an effective inductive bias for neural speech compression, producing compact yet recognition-friendly representations.

Abstract: We explore the edge-flipping mechanism, a type of input perturbation, to release the directed graph under edge-local differential privacy. By using the noisy bi-degree sequence from the output graph, we construct the moment equations to estimate the unknown parameters in the $p_0$ model, which is an exponential family distribution with the bi-degree sequence as the natural sufficient statistic. We show that the resulting private estimator is asymptotically consistent and normally distributed under some conditions. In addition, we compare the performance of input and output perturbation mechanisms for releasing bi-degree sequences in terms of parameter estimation accuracy and privacy protection. Numerical studies demonstrate our theoretical findings and compare the performance of the private estimates obtained by different types of perturbation methods. We apply the proposed method to analyze the UC Irvine message network.

Abstract: Singular learning theory (SLT) \citep{watanabe2009algebraic,watanabe2018mathematical} provides a rigorous asymptotic framework for Bayesian models with non-identifiable parameterizations, yet the statistical meaning of its second-order invariant, the \emph{singular fluctuation}, has remained unclear. In this work, we show that singular fluctuation admits a precise and natural interpretation as a \emph{specific heat}: the second derivative of the Bayesian free energy with respect to temperature. Equivalently, it measures the posterior variance of the log-likelihood observable under the tempered Gibbs posterior. We further introduce a collection of related thermodynamic quantities, including entropy flow, prior susceptibility, and cross-susceptibility, that together provide a detailed geometric diagnosis of singular posterior structure. Through extensive numerical experiments spanning discrete symmetries, boundary singularities, continuous gauge freedoms, and piecewise (ReLU) models, we demonstrate that these thermodynamic signatures cleanly distinguish singularity types, exhibit stable finite-sample behavior, and reveal phase-transition--like phenomena as temperature varies. We also show empirically that the widely used WAIC estimator \citep{watanabe2010asymptotic, watanabe2013widely} is exactly twice the thermodynamic specific heat at unit temperature, clarifying its robustness in singular models.Our results establish a concrete bridge between singular learning theory and statistical mechanics, providing both theoretical insight and practical diagnostics for modern Bayesian models.

Abstract: Probabilistic programming provides a high-level framework for specifying statistical models as executable programs with built-in randomness and conditioning. Existing inference techniques, however, typically compute posterior distributions over program states at fixed time points, most often at termination, thereby failing to capture the temporal evolution of probabilistic behaviors. We introduce temporal posterior inference (TPI), a new framework that unifies probabilistic programming with temporal logic by computing posterior distributions over execution traces that satisfy omega-regular specifications, conditioned on possibly temporal observations. To obtain rigorous quantitative guarantees, we develop a new method for computing upper and lower bounds on the satisfaction probabilities of omega-regular properties. Our approach decomposes Rabin acceptance conditions into persistence and recurrence components and constructs stochastic barrier certificates that soundly bound each component. We implement our approach in a prototype tool, TPInfer, and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, demonstrating effective and efficient inference over rich temporal properties in probabilistic models.

Abstract: Multimodal cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging provides comprehensive and non-invasive insights into cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis and underlying mechanisms. Despite decades of advancements, its widespread clinical adoption remains constrained by prolonged scan times and heterogeneity across medical environments. This underscores the urgent need for a generalist reconstruction foundation model for ultra-fast CMR imaging, one capable of adapting across diverse imaging scenarios and serving as the essential substrate for all downstream analyses. To enable this goal, we curate MMCMR-427K, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal CMR k-space database to date, comprising 427,465 multi-coil k-space data paired with structured metadata across 13 international centers, 12 CMR modalities, 15 scanners, and 17 CVD categories in populations across three continents. Building on this unprecedented resource, we introduce CardioMM, a generalist reconstruction foundation model capable of dynamically adapting to heterogeneous fast CMR imaging scenarios. CardioMM unifies semantic contextual understanding with physics-informed data consistency to deliver robust reconstructions across varied scanners, protocols, and patient presentations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that CardioMM achieves state-of-the-art performance in the internal centers and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen external settings. Even at imaging acceleration up to 24x, CardioMM reliably preserves key cardiac phenotypes, quantitative myocardial biomarkers, and diagnostic image quality, enabling a substantial increase in CMR examination throughput without compromising clinical integrity. Together, our open-access MMCMR-427K database and CardioMM framework establish a scalable pathway toward high-throughput, high-quality, and clinically accessible cardiovascular imaging.

Abstract: Phylogenetic trees provide a fundamental representation of evolutionary relationships, yet the combinatorial explosion of possible tree topologies renders inference computationally challenging. Classical approaches to characterizing tree space, such as the Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) space, offer elegant geometric structure but suffer from statistical and computational limitations. An alternative perspective arises from tropical geometry, the tropical Grassmannian tropGr(2,n), introduced by Speyer and Sturmfels, which coincides with phylogenetic tree space. In this paper, we review the structure of the tropical Grassmannian and present algorithmic methods for its computational study, including procedures for sampling from the tropical Grassmannian. Our aim is to make these concepts accessible to evolutionary biologists and computational scientists, and to motivate new research directions at the interface of algebraic geometry and phylogenetic inference.
