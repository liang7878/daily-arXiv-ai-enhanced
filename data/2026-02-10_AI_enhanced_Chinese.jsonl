Although logs originate from nested component executions with clear boundaries, this structure is lost when they are stored as flat sequences. As a result, state-of-the-art methods risk missing true dependencies within executions while learning spurious ones across unrelated events. We propose KRONE, the first hierarchical anomaly detection framework that automatically derives execution hierarchies from flat logs for modular multi-level anomaly detection. At its core, the KRONE Log Abstraction Model captures application-specific semantic hierarchies from log data. This hierarchy is then leveraged to recursively decompose log sequences into multiple levels of coherent execution chunks, referred to as KRONE Seqs, transforming sequence-level anomaly detection into a set of modular KRONE Seq-level detection tasks. For each test KRONE Seq, KRONE employs a hybrid modular detection mechanism that dynamically routes between an efficient level-independent Local-Context detector, which rapidly filters normal sequences, and a Nested-Aware detector that incorporates cross-level semantic dependencies and supports LLM-based anomaly detection and explanation. KRONE further optimizes hierarchical detection through cached result reuse and early-exit strategies. Experiments on three public benchmarks and one industrial dataset from ByteDance Cloud demonstrate that KRONE achieves consistent improvements in detection accuracy, F1-score, data efficiency, resource efficiency, and interpretability. KRONE improves the F1-score by more than 10 percentage points over prior methods while reducing LLM usage to only a small fraction of the test data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faKRONE\u5c42\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u6241\u5e73\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u7ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u591a\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\u6309\u6241\u5e73\u5e8f\u5217\u5b58\u50a8\u4e22\u5931\u5d4c\u5957\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u8bef\u5224\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaKRONE Log Abstraction Model \u4ece\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u5c06\u65e5\u5fd7\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u89e3\u4e3aKRONE Seqs\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Local - Context\u548cNested - Aware\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u5b58\u7ed3\u679c\u590d\u7528\u548c\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cKRONE\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001F1\u5206\u6570\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u8d8510\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "KRONE\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Using Alibaba's MaxCompute as a representative, we surface four fundamental, system-agnostic challenges for any deployable learned query optimizer: 1) highly dynamic execution environments that induce large variance in plan costs; 2) potential absence of input statistics needed for cost estimation; 3) infeasibility of conventional model refinement; and 4) uncertain benefits across different workloads. These challenges expose a deep mismatch between theoretical advances and production realities and demand a principled, deployment-first redesign of learned optimizers.\n  To bridge this gap, we present LOAM, a one-stop learned query optimization framework for MaxCompute. Its design principles and techniques generalize and are readily adaptable to similar systems. Architecturally, LOAM introduces a statistics-free plan encoding that leverages operator semantics and historical executions to infer details about data distributions and explicitly encodes the execution environments of training queries to learn their impacts on plan costs. For online queries with unknown environments at prediction time, LOAM provides a theoretical bound on the achievable performance and a practical strategy to smooth the environmental impacts on cost estimations. For system operating, LOAM integrates domain adaptation techniques into training to generalize effectively to online query plans without requiring conventional refinement. Additionally, LOAM includes a lightweight project selector to prioritize high-benefit deployment projects. LOAM has seen up to 30% CPU cost savings over MaxCompute's native query optimizer on production workloads, which could translate to substantial real-world resource savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u79df\u6237\u6570\u636e\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLOAM\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u8282\u7701CPU\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u56e0\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u79df\u6237\u6570\u636e\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u56db\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLOAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u4f9b\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9879\u76ee\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u3002", "result": "LOAM\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u6bd4MaxCompute\u539f\u751f\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8282\u7701\u9ad8\u8fbe30%\u7684CPU\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "LOAM\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u548c\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to automate data preparation from natural language specifications. However, existing LLM-powered methods either make decisions without grounding in intermediate execution results, or rely on linear interaction processes that offer limited support for revising earlier decisions. To address these limitations, we propose DeepPrep, an LLM-powered agentic system for autonomous data preparation. DeepPrep constructs data preparation pipelines through iterative, execution-grounded interaction with an environment that materializes intermediate table states and returns runtime feedback. To overcome the limitations of linear interaction, DeepPrep organizes pipeline construction with tree-based agentic reasoning, enabling structured exploration and non-local revision based on execution feedback. To enable effective learning of such behaviors, we propose a progressive agentic training framework, together with data synthesis that supplies diverse and complex ADP tasks.

As our main contribution, we give a nontrivial generalization of a seminal result of Dinitz, Garg, and Goemans (1999) by showing how to efficiently turn a given transshipment $x$ into an unsplittable transshipment $y$ with $y_a<x_a+d_{\\max}$ for all arcs $a$, where $d_{\\max}$ is the maximum demand (or supply) value. Further results include bounds on the number of rounds required to satisfy all demands, where each round consists of an unsplittable transshipment that routes a subset of the demands while respecting arc capacity constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u4e2d\u591a\u6e90\u591a\u6c47\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u62c6\u5206\u8f6c\u8fd0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u524d\u4eba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u9700\u6c42\u6240\u9700\u8f6e\u6570\u7684\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u53ef\u62c6\u5206\u8f6c\u8fd0\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5355\u6e90\u4e0d\u53ef\u62c6\u5206\u6d41\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u4f46\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8f6c\u8fd0x\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u62c6\u5206\u8f6c\u8fd0y\uff0c\u4f7fy_a < x_a + d_max \u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5f27a\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9Dinitz\u7b49\u4eba\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u62d3\u5c55\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u8f6e\u6570\u7684\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u53ef\u62c6\u5206\u8f6c\u8fd0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u8f6e\u6570\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

We argue this brittleness is often data-induced: when images carry \"silent\" evidence and queries leave key semantics implicit, a single embedding pass must both reason and compress, encouraging spurious feature matching. We propose a data-centric framework that decouples these roles by externalizing reasoning before retrieval. Using a strong Vision--Language Model, we make implicit semantics explicit by densely captioning visual evidence in corpus entries, resolving ambiguous multimodal references in queries, and rewriting verbose instructions into concise retrieval constraints. Inference-time enhancement alone is insufficient; the retriever must be trained on these semantically dense representations to avoid distribution shift and fully exploit the added signal. Across M-BEIR, our reasoning-augmented training method yields consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations showing that corpus enhancement chiefly benefits knowledge-intensive queries while query enhancement is critical for compositional modification requests.

In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u51c6LLM - FSM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u8303\u6062\u590d\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aRTL\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728FSM\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u679c\u4e14\u57fa\u51c6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u8303\u6062\u590d\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u4f20\u8f93\u7ea7\uff08RTL\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaLLM - FSM\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efaFSM\uff0c\u8ba9LLM\u4ee5YAML\u683c\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbeFSM\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u53c2\u8003RTL\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728FSM\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e5f\u4f1a\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM - FSM\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u968f\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u6269\u5c55FSM\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This study investigated the effectiveness of physics-informed recurrent neural networks (PIRNNs) that integrate the mechanistic population balance model with recurrent neural networks under the presence of systematic and model uncertainties. Such uncertainties are represented by using synthetic data containing controlled noise, solubility shift, and limited sampling. The research demonstrates that PIRNNs achieve strong generalization and physical consistency, maintain stable learning behavior, and accurately recover kinetic parameters despite significant stochastic variations in the training data. In the case of systematic errors in the solubility model, the inclusion of physics regularization improved the test performance by more than an order of magnitude compared to purely data-driven models, whereas excessive weighting of physics increased error arising due to the model mismatch. The results also show that PIRNNs are able to recover model parameters and replicate crystallization dynamics even in the limit of very low sampling resolution.

Our starting point is the classic online setting with preemption of Buchbinder et al. [SODA'15], in which a hiring principal faces a sequence of adversarial agent arrivals. Upon arrival, the principal must decide whether to tentatively accept the agent to their team, and whether to dismiss previous tentative choices. Dismissal is irrevocable, giving the setting its online decision-making flavor. In our setting, the agents are rational players: once the team is finalized, a game is played where the principal offers contracts (performance-based payment schemes), and each agent decides whether or not to work. Working agents reward the principal, and the goal is to choose a team that maximizes the principal's utility. Our main positive result is a 1/2-competitive algorithm when agent rewards are additive, which matches the best-possible competitive ratio.

Extreme fear and extreme greed regimes exhibit significantly higher spreads than neutral periods -- a phenomenon we term the \"extremity premium.\" Extended validation on the full Fear & Greed history (February 2018--January 2026, N = 2,896) confirms the finding: within-volatility-quintile comparisons show a significant premium (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.21), Granger causality from uncertainty to spreads is strong (F = 211), and placebo tests reject the null (p < 0.0001). The effect replicates on Ethereum and across 6 of 7 market cycles. However, the premium is sensitive to functional form: comprehensive regression controls absorb regime effects, while nonparametric stratification preserves them. We interpret this as evidence that sentiment extremity captures volatility-regime interactions not fully represented by parametric controls -- consistent with, but not conclusively separable from, the F&G Index's embedded volatility component. An agent-based model reproduces the pattern qualitatively.

This paper integrates three curriculum-learning methods as primal-dual (PD) optimization, causality progression, and adaptive sampling into the VSR-PINN. The PD strategy balances physics and data losses, the causality scheme unlocks deeper stacks by respecting temporal and gradient evolution, and adaptive sampling targets high residuals.

We propose and evaluate three distinct DRO formulations: mixture ambiguity sets with discrete scenarios, box ambiguity sets of discrete distribution functions, and Wasserstein metric ambiguity sets. Utilizing empirical data from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), we conduct a comparative analysis of these models against traditional stochastic programming approaches. Our results demonstrate that DRO formulations, specifically those utilizing Wasserstein and box ambiguity sets, consistently outperform both mixture-based DRO and stochastic programming in terms of funding ratios and overall fund returns. These findings suggest that incorporating distributional robustness significantly enhances the resilience and performance of pension fund management strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u8d44\u4ea7\u8d1f\u503a\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff08DRO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cdDRO\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u90e8\u5206DRO\u516c\u5f0f\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u957f\u671f\u503a\u52a1\u507f\u4ed8\u80fd\u529b\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cdDRO\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u3001\u7bb1\u5f0f\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u548cWasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eWasserstein\u548c\u7bb1\u5f0f\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u7684DRO\u516c\u5f0f\u5728\u8d44\u91d1\u6bd4\u7387\u548c\u57fa\u91d1\u603b\u4f53\u56de\u62a5\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u7684DRO\u548c\u968f\u673a\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7eb3\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

These properties create two practical tensions. First, dense FFNs spend the same compute on every token regardless of context, and they allocate capacity uniformly even when language exhibits highly clustered context structure. Second, continual learning, in the sense of updating the model while serving a data stream, often produces interference because a small update touches broadly shared weights.\n  We propose Attractor Patch Networks (APN), a plug-compatible replacement for the Transformer FFN. APN is a bank of patch experts. A similarity router selects a small top-k set of patches for each token by matching the token representation to learned prototypes. Each selected patch emits a low-rank residual update conditioned on a compact code. The architecture yields conditional, context-specialized nonlinear transformations while preserving the standard Transformer interface.\n  This paper focuses on APN as an architectural primitive. We formalize APN, analyze its expressivity as a piecewise low-rank residual function class, and derive simple interference and stability arguments that make APN naturally compatible with continual learning. In experiments on character-level language modeling, APN achieves competitive perplexity (4.57 vs 4.32 PPL) while enabling dramatically better continual adaptation: when adapting to a shifted domain, APN achieves 2.6 times better retention (11.1 vs 29.4 PPL on the original domain) and 2.8 times better adaptation (6.4 vs 17.8 PPL on the new domain) compared to global fine-tuning of a dense FFN baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAttractor Patch Networks (APN)\u66ff\u4ee3Transformer FFN\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u7684FFN\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAPN\uff0c\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8def\u7531\u5668\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u9009\u62e9\u4e13\u5bb6patch\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cAPN\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "APN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u9002\u914d\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

We propose a hybrid two-stage causal screener to address this challenge: (i) a statistical stage that uses Granger causality to identify candidate leader-follower pairs from market-implied probability time series, and (ii) an LLM-based semantic stage that re-ranks these candidates by assessing whether the proposed direction admits a plausible economic transmission mechanism based on event descriptions. Because causal ground truth is unobserved, we evaluate the ranked pairs using a fixed, signal-triggered trading protocol that maps relationship quality into realized profit and loss (PnL). On Kalshi Economics markets, our hybrid approach consistently outperforms the statistical baseline. Across rolling evaluations, the win rate increases from 51.4% to 54.5%. Crucially, the average magnitude of losing trades decreases substantially from 649 USD to 347 USD. This reduction is driven by the LLM's ability to filter out statistically fragile links that are prone to large losses, rather than relying on rare gains. These improvements remain stable across different trading configurations, indicating that the gains are not driven by specific parameter choices.

To explore this, we select a financial stock market scenario to test behavioral consistency. Investors are typically classified as fundamental or technical traders, but most simulations fix strategies at initialization, failing to reflect real-world trading dynamics. In this work, we assess whether agents' strategy switching aligns with financial theory, providing a framework for this evaluation. We operationalize four behavioral-finance drivers-loss aversion, herding, wealth differentiation, and price misalignment-as personality traits set via prompting and stored long-term. In year-long simulations, agents process daily price-volume data, trade under a designated style, and reassess their strategy every 10 trading days. We introduce four alignment metrics and use Mann-Whitney U tests to compare agents' style-switching behavior with financial theory.

Low recovery rates in failure suggest that most failed banks that experienced runs were likely fundamentally insolvent. Examiners' postmortem assessments also emphasize the primacy of poor asset quality and solvency problems. Before deposit insurance, runs commonly triggered the failure of insolvent banks.

An overarching motif of many Bayesian methods is that they are relatively slow, which often becomes prohibitive when fitting complex models to large data sets.

ABI trains neural networks on model simulations, rewarding users with rapid inference of any model-implied quantity, such as point estimates, likelihoods, or full posterior distributions. In this work, we present the Python library BayesFlow, Version 2.0, for general-purpose ABI. Along with direct posterior, likelihood, and ratio estimation, the software includes support for multiple popular deep learning backends, a rich collection of generative networks for sampling and density estimation, complete customization and high-level interfaces, as well as new capabilities for hyperparameter optimization, design optimization, and hierarchical modeling.

In practice, such tables are often interpreted manually by human experts, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, automating this process remains difficult. Existing Text-to-SQL methods typically require converting semi-structured tables into structured formats, inevitably leading to information loss, while approaches like Text-to-Code and multimodal LLM-based QA struggle with complex layouts and often yield inaccurate answers. To address these limitations, we present ST-Raptor, an agentic system for semi-structured table QA.

However, a persistent challenge has been to construct highly optimized and often complex designs. This contribution formulates and solves new mixed-integer linear programs that enable consideration of the interplay between environmental impact and constructability. Specifically, the design engineer is enabled to design with multiple materials and/or structural components, apply separate minimum and maximum cross-sectional area bounds, and constrain the complexity of the structural connections. This is done while explicitly considering compatibility and constitutive laws. The results demonstrate that the lowest embodied carbon designs change significantly when constructability constraints are applied, highlighting the need for an integrated optimization approach. In one example, introducing a lower-carbon material option has almost no effect on the environmental performance, whereas another sees an improvement of nearly 29%. The extensibility of the formulation to design with three component types and additional constraints is demonstrated for a prestressed tensegrity example.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u89e3\u51b3\u6841\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u53ef\u5efa\u9020\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u5efa\u9020\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6700\u4f4e\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6841\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u57df\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5efa\u7b51\u7684\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5236\u5b9a\u5e76\u6c42\u89e3\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6750\u6599\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u672c\u6784\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u622a\u9762\u9762\u79ef\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u63a5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u5efa\u9020\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u6700\u4f4e\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4f4e\u78b3\u6750\u6599\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6709\u7684\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u7684\u6539\u5584\u8fd129%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u7efc\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u53ef\u5efa\u9020\u6027\u3002"}}

Vardi"], "title": "Modeling Concurrent Multi-Agent Systems", "categories": ["cs.GT"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent work in the field of multi-agent systems has sought to use techniques and concepts from the field of formal methods to provide rigorous theoretical analysis and guarantees on complex systems where multiple agents strategically interact, leading to the creation of the field of equilibrium analysis, which studies equilibria concepts from the field of game theory through a complexity-theoretic lens. Multi-agent systems, however, are complex mathematical objects, and, therefore, defining them in a precise mathematical manner is non-trivial. As a result, researchers often considered more restrictive models that are easier to model but lack expressive power or simply omit critical complexity-theoretic results in their analysis. This paper addresses this problem by carefully analyzing and contrasting complexity-theoretic results in the explicit model, a mathematically precise formulation of the models commonly used in the literature, and the circuit-based model, a novel model that addresses the problems found in the literature. The utility of the circuit-based model is demonstrated through a comprehensive analysis that considers upper and lower bounds for the realizability and verification problems, the two most important decision problems in equilibrium analysis, for both models. By conducting this analysis, we see that problematic issues that are endemic to the explicit model and the equilibrium analysis literature as a whole are adequately handled by the circuit-based model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u6bd4\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u540e\u8005\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u524d\u8005\u53ca\u5747\u8861\u5206\u6790\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u91cd\u8981\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ed4\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u59a5\u5584\u5904\u7406\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5747\u8861\u5206\u6790\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5747\u8861\u5206\u6790\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

On the Practical Molecular Optimization (PMO) benchmark with a budget of 1,000 evaluations (PMO-1K), MolLIBRA-L, our variant with a language-model-based candidate generator, attains the best Top-10 AUC on 14/22 tasks and the highest overall sum of Top-10 AUC across tasks among prior methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMolLIBRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728PMO - 1K\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6709\u9650\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684MolLIBRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u5206\u5b50\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c - \u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u9f50\u7f16\u7801\u5668CLAMP\u3002", "result": "\u5728PMO - 1K\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMolLIBRA - L\u572814/22\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73Top - 10 AUC\uff0c\u4e14\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684Top - 10 AUC\u603b\u548c\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "MolLIBRA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While space-time TT solvers have demonstrated significant potential for compressed high-dimensional simulations, the literature contains few systematic comparisons with classical time-stepping methods, limited error convergence analyses, and little quantitative assessment of the impact of TT rounding on numerical accuracy. Likewise, existing studies fail to demonstrate performance across a diverse set of PDEs and parameter ranges. In practice, monolithic Newton iterations may stagnate or fail to converge in strongly nonlinear, stiff, or advection-dominated regimes, where poor initial guesses and severely ill-conditioned space-time Jacobians hinder robust convergence. We overcome this limitation by introducing a coarse-to-fine multilevel strategy fully embedded within the TT format. Each level refines both spatial and temporal resolutions while transferring the TT solution through low-rank prolongation operators, providing robust initializations for successive Newton solves. Residuals, Jacobians, and transfer operators are represented directly in TT and solved with the adaptive-rank DMRG algorithm. Numerical experiments for a selection of nonlinear PDEs including Fisher-KPP, viscous Burgers, sine-Gordon, and KdV cover diffusive, convective, and dispersive dynamics, demonstrating that the multilevel TT approach consistently converges where single-level space-time Newton iterations fail. In dynamic, advection-dominated (nonlinear) scenarios, multilevel TT surpasses single-level TT, achieving high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost, specifically when high-fidelity numerical simulation is required.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7ea7\u5f20\u91cf\u5217\u8f66\uff08TT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u591a\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u514b\u670d\u5355\u7ea7\u6c42\u89e3\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u7a7aTT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5c11\u3001\u8bef\u5dee\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\u6709\u9650\u3001TT\u820d\u5165\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540cPDE\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u6027\u80fd\u5c55\u793a\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5355\u7ea7\u725b\u987f\u8fed\u4ee3\u5728\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b49\u60c5\u51b5\u53ef\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5b8c\u5168\u5d4c\u5165TT\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u591a\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6bcf\u7ea7\u7ec6\u5316\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5ef6\u62d3\u7b97\u5b50\u4f20\u9012TT\u89e3\uff0c\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u79e9DMRG\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u4ee5TT\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u3001\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u4f20\u9012\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u975e\u7ebf\u6027PDE\uff0c\u591a\u7ea7TT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u7ea7\u65f6\u7a7a\u725b\u987f\u8fed\u4ee3\u5931\u8d25\u5904\u80fd\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u6d41\u4e3b\u5bfc\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u7ea7TT\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7ea7TT\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u6bd4\u5355\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

In this work, we present Neural Sabermetrics with World Model, a Large Language Model (LLM) based play-by-play world model for baseball. We cast baseball games as long auto-regressive sequences of events and continuously pretrain a single LLM on more than ten years of Major League Baseball (MLB) tracking data, comprising over seven million pitch sequences and approximately three billion tokens. The resulting model is capable of predicting multiple aspects of game evolution within a unified framework. We evaluate our model on both in-distribution regular-season data and out-of-distribution postseason games and compare against strong neural baselines from prior work.

However, accurately and efficiently identifying these relationships in large and complex schemas can be challenging, especially in enterprise settings where access to data values is constrained. In this paper, we introduce the problem of join graph inference when only metadata is available. We conduct an empirical study on a large number of real-world schemas and observe that join graphs when represented as adjacency matrices exhibit two key properties: high sparsity and low-rank structure. Based on these novel observations, we formulate join graph inference as a low-rank matrix completion problem and propose Nexus, an end-to-end solution using only metadata. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization algorithm that alternates between low-rank matrix completion and refining join candidate probabilities by leveraging Large Language Models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Nexus outperforms existing methods by a significant margin on four datasets including a real-world production dataset.

In this setting, the goal is to locally determine, for each edge $ e \\in E $, whether it belongs to a spanning tree $ T $ of the input graph $ G $, where $ T $ is defined implicitly by $ G $ and the randomness of the algorithm. It is known that LCAs for spanning trees do not exist in general graphs, even for simple graph families. We identify a natural and well-studied class of graphs -- \\emph{expander graphs} -- that do admit \\emph{sublinear-time} LCAs for spanning trees. This is perhaps surprising, as previous work on expanders only succeeded in designing LCAs for \\emph{sparse spanning subgraphs}, rather than full spanning trees. We design an LCA with probe complexity $ O\\left(\\sqrt{n}\\left(\\frac{\\log^2 n}{\u03c6^2} + d\\right)\\right)$ for graphs with conductance at least $ \u03c6$ and maximum degree at most $ d $ (not necessarily constant), which is nearly optimal when $\u03c6$ and $d$ are constants, since $\u03a9(\\sqrt{n})$ probes are necessary even for expanders. Next, we show that for the natural class of \\emph{\\ER graphs} $ G(n, p) $ with $ np = n^\u03b4 $ for any constant $ \u03b4> 0 $ (which are expanders with high probability), the $ \\sqrt{n} $ lower bound can be bypassed.

Specifically, given a $d$-regular unweighted graph $\\bar{G}$ with sufficiently strong expansion, we consider the weighted graph $G$ obtained by assigning to each edge an independent and uniform random weight from $\\{1,\\ldots,W\\}$, where $W = O(d)$.

We build a sequence-item (SI) view by attention pooling over the user's interacted items to form sequence nodes.

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

They do not distinguish whether errors stem from retrieval failures, generation flaws, finance-specific reasoning mistakes, or misunderstanding of the query or context. This makes it difficult to pinpoint performance bottlenecks. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Fin-RATE, a benchmark built on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and mirror financial analyst workflows through three pathways: detail-oriented reasoning within individual disclosures, cross-entity comparison under shared topics, and longitudinal tracking of the same firm across reporting periods. We benchmark 17 leading LLMs, spanning open-source, closed-source, and finance-specialized models, under both ground-truth context and retrieval-augmented settings. Results show substantial performance degradation, with accuracy dropping by 18.60% and 14.35% as tasks shift from single-document reasoning to longitudinal and cross-entity analysis.

Axioms of proportionality have recently been defined for this general model, but the proposed rules apply only to approval ballots, where each voter submits a subset of candidates she finds acceptable.

We find infrastructure failures produce mean Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR) of -7.6% (bootstrap 95% CI: [-25.8%, +11.3%]) and regulatory enforcement produces mean CAR of -11.1% (CI: [-31.0%, +10.7%]).

We present a multi-task evaluation of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs across five representative software engineering tasks: bug fixing, feature development, code refactoring, technical copywriting, and research synthesis. Our automated verification framework measures both output quality and completion efficiency. Key findings reveal that (1) models achieving identical perfect scores exhibit 22x variation in completion time, 49x variation in tool efficiency, and 53x variation in estimated cost; (2) tool usage frequency shows no correlation with success (r = 0.077, p = 0.575) - one model used 917 tool calls while another solved the same task with 3 calls; (3) we identify two distinct inefficiency patterns: loop inefficiency and inference inefficiency; and (4) coding tasks achieve 100 percent success while research tasks present greater challenges (90.9 percent).

In contrast, biological nervous systems sustain reliable function across decades through homeostatic regulation coordinated across multiple temporal scales.

MSTH implements the cross-scale coordination system for artificial neural networks, providing a unified temporal hierarchy that moves beyond superficial biomimicry. The cross-scale coordination enhances computational efficiency through evolutionary-refined optimization mechanisms.

Moreover, MSTH outperforms both single-scale bio-inspired models and established state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating generality across diverse domains.

The existence of such a perfect-fit model implies the absence of arbitrage among CDO tranches and is thus essential for unified risk management and the pricing of nonstandard credit derivatives. To address this central challenge, we face three primary difficulties: standard parametric models typically fail to achieve a perfect fit; the calibration of standard parametric models inherently relies on computationally intensive simulation-based optimization; and there is a lack of formal theory to determine when a perfect-fit model exists and, if it exists, how to construct it. We propose a theoretical framework to overcome these difficulties. We first introduce and define two compatibility levels of market prices: weak compatibility and strong compatibility. Specifically, market prices across all tranches are said to be weakly (resp. strongly) compatible if there exists a single model (resp. a single conditionally i.i.d. model) that perfectly fits these market prices. We then derive sufficient and necessary conditions for both levels of compatibility by establishing a relationship between compatibility and LP problems. Furthermore, under either condition, we construct a corresponding concrete copula model that achieves a perfect fit. Notably, our framework not only allows for efficient verification of weak compatibility and strong compatibility through LP problems but also facilitates the construction of the corresponding copula models that achieve a perfect fit, eliminating the need for simulation-based optimization. The practical applications of our framework are demonstrated in risk management and the pricing of nonstandard credit derivatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3CDO\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u4e00\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u7f8e\u62df\u5408\u6240\u6709\u5206\u5c42\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u62df\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3CDO\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u4e00\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u7f8e\u62df\u5408\u6240\u6709\u5206\u5c42\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7edf\u4e00\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u4fe1\u7528\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u5f31\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e24\u79cd\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u80fd\u5b8c\u7f8e\u62df\u5408\u7684\u5177\u4f53copula\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u9ad8\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f31\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5c31\u80fd\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u7f8e\u62df\u5408\u7684copula\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u4fe1\u7528\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e2d\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Key results show that the gender gap in paid labor exhibits a U-shaped relationship with droughts and an inverted U-shaped relationship with extreme wet conditions. The drought pattern is primarily driven by gender gap in employment while wetness affects gender gap in participation through unemployment. These relationships vary with country characteristics. Countries with high disaster-displacement risk exhibit declining gender gaps in participation during excess wetness while moderate-risk economies experience expanded gaps during droughts. Furthermore, the drought U-shape is most pronounced in countries with low to moderate empowerment while the nonlinear wet responses is concentrated only in moderately empowered countries. Lastly, both droughts and excess wetness expands gender gap in countries with weak net resilience to climate shocks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u67901995 - 2019\u5e74151\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6781\u7aef\u6c14\u5019\u4e0e\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u53c2\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\u5448U\u578b\u6216\u5012U\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u56e0\u56fd\u5bb6\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6781\u7aef\u6c14\u5019\u6761\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528151\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb61995 - 2019\u5e74\u7684\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u507f\u52b3\u52a8\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0e\u5e72\u65f1\u5448U\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e0e\u6781\u7aef\u6e7f\u6da6\u5448\u5012U\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u707e\u5bb3\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u56fd\u5bb6\u8d4b\u6743\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u51b2\u51fb\u51c0\u6062\u590d\u529b\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u5448\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6781\u7aef\u6c14\u5019\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u53d7\u56fd\u5bb6\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u3002"}}

Transferring these practical successes to discrete generative modeling, however, remains particularly challenging and largely unexplored, mainly due to the drastic shift in generative model classes to discrete state spaces, which are nowhere differentiable. In this work, we propose Discrete Adjoint Matching (DAM) -- a discrete variant of AM for fine-tuning discrete generative models characterized by Continuous-Time Markov Chains, such as diffusion-based large language models. The core of DAM is the introduction of discrete adjoint-an estimator of the optimal solution to the original problem but formulated on discrete domains-from which standard matching frameworks can be applied.

The \\emph{weighted max-min $T$-join problem} formalizes this challenge by seeking a subset of vertices whose minimum-weight matching is maximized, thereby ensuring robust outcomes against unfavorable pairings.\n  We advance the study of this problem in several directions. First, we design an algorithm that computes an upper bound for the \\emph{weighted max-min $2k$-matching problem}, where the chosen set must contain exactly $2k$ vertices. Building on this bound, we develop a general algorithm with a \\emph{$2 \\ln n$-approximation guarantee} that runs in $O(n^4)$ time. Second, using ear decompositions, we propose another upper bound for the weighted max-min $T$-join cost.

Our progressive searching algorithm incrementally refines the candidate set through a hierarchy of searches, starting from low-dimensional embeddings and progressing into a higher, target-dimensionality.

This work is inspired by loan portfolio modeling against default risk used in banking. In mathematical terms, we calculate the probability distribution of the sum of N non-homogeneous Boolean outcomes (investments becoming outliers) that are correlated through common factors such as overall market conditions and sector effects. Specifically, we implemented a latent-factor model in which each investment's success is the exceedance of a Gaussian latent variable composed of idiosyncratic returns and returns from interpretable shared factors (stock markets, industry sector indices, geography and founder type). The formulation follows a simulation approach to preserve heterogeneous deal-level success probabilities and uses empirically estimated correlation matrices. When applied to synthetic portfolios, our model reveals that expected outlier counts alone are insufficient statistics for evaluating venture portfolios. Portfolios with identical expected outcomes can exhibit drastically different levels of reliability and risk when various levels and forms of correlation are embedded. Diversification improves the probability of achieving a minimum number of outliers by reducing exposure to common shocks, but at the cost of lower upside, underscoring a fundamental tradeoff between reliability and magnitude of clustered successes. The framework provides a practical bridge between deal-level outlier probability assessment and objective-aware portfolio construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6982\u7387\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u98ce\u6295\u7ec4\u5408\u7ee9\u6548\u6982\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u4ec5\u7528\u9884\u671f\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u8ba1\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u6295\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u805a\u7c7b\u6210\u529f\u5e45\u5ea6\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u94f6\u884c\u8d37\u6b3e\u7ec4\u5408\u8fdd\u7ea6\u98ce\u9669\u5efa\u6a21\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u98ce\u6295\u7ec4\u5408\u7ee9\u6548\u5b9a\u4e49\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u8ba1\u7b97N\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u540c\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u975e\u540c\u8d28\u5e03\u5c14\u7ed3\u679c\u603b\u548c\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u540c\u9884\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5206\u6563\u6295\u8d44\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5c11\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f46\u4e0a\u9650\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4ea4\u6613\u5c42\u9762\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6982\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

While recent agentic frameworks improve alpha mining automation, they often lack controllable multi-round search and reliable reuse of validated experience. To address these challenges, we propose QuantaAlpha, an evolutionary alpha mining framework that treats each end-to-end mining run as a trajectory and improves factors through trajectory-level mutation and crossover operations. QuantaAlpha localizes suboptimal steps in each trajectory for targeted revision and recombines complementary high-reward segments to reuse effective patterns, enabling structured exploration and refinement across mining iterations. During factor generation, QuantaAlpha enforces semantic consistency across the hypothesis, factor expression, and executable code, while constraining the complexity and redundancy of the generated factor to mitigate crowding. Extensive experiments on the China Securities Index 300 (CSI 300) demonstrate consistent gains over strong baseline models and prior agentic systems.

This raises a fundamental, yet unexplored question: Can an LLM's functional correctness be assessed purely from its internal computational structure? Our primary objective is to investigate whether the model's neural dynamics encode internally decodable signals that are predictive of logical validity during code generation. Inspired by mechanistic interpretability, we propose to treat code verification as a mechanistic diagnostic task, mapping the model's explicit algorithmic trajectory into line-level attribution graphs. By decomposing complex residual flows, we aim to identify the structural signatures that distinguish sound reasoning from logical failure within the model's internal circuits. Analysis across Python, C++, and Java confirms that intrinsic correctness signals are robust across diverse syntaxes. Topological features from these internal graphs predict correctness more reliably than surface heuristics and enable targeted causal interventions to fix erroneous logic.

Recent work suggests that circuit-level brain alterations manifest as changes in electroencephalography (EEG) spectral features detectable by machine learning. However, conventional deep learning approaches for EEG-based AD detection are computationally intensive and mechanistically opaque. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible and energy-efficient alternative, yet their application to AD diagnosis remains largely unexplored.\n  We propose a neuro-bridge framework that links data-driven learning with minimal, biophysically grounded simulations, enabling bidirectional interpretation between machine learning signatures and circuit-level mechanisms in AD. Using resting-state clinical EEG, we train an SNN classifier that achieves competitive performance (AUC = 0.839) and identifies the aperiodic 1/f slope as a key discriminative marker.\n  The 1/f slope reflects excitation-inhibition balance. To interpret this mechanistically, we construct spiking network simulations in which inhibitory-to-excitatory synaptic ratios are systematically varied to emulate healthy, mild cognitive impairment, and AD-like states. Using both membrane potential-based and synaptic current-based EEG proxies, we reproduce empirical spectral slowing and altered alpha organization.\n  Incorporating empirical functional connectivity priors into multi-subnetwork simulations further enhances spectral differentiation, demonstrating that large-scale network topology constrains EEG signatures more strongly than excitation-inhibition balance alone.

We evaluated TransConv-DDPM on three diverse datasets, generating both long and short-sequence time-series data. Quantitative comparisons against state-of-the-art methods, TimeGAN and Diffusion-TS, using four performance metrics, demonstrated promising results, particularly on the SmartFallMM and EEG datasets, where it effectively captured the more gradual temporal change patterns between data points. Additionally, a utility test on the SmartFallMM dataset revealed that adding synthetic fall data generated by TransConv-DDPM improved predictive model performance, showing a 13.64% improvement in F1-score and a 14.93% increase in overall accuracy compared to the baseline model trained solely on fall data from the SmartFallMM dataset. These findings highlight the potential of TransConv-DDPM to generate high-quality synthetic data for real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u65b9\u6cd5TransConv - DDPM\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u6709\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\u533b\u5b66AI\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u751f\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165TransConv - DDPM\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e26U - Net\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5c42\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff08DDPM\uff09\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5728SmartFallMM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6548\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad813.64%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad814.93%\u3002", "conclusion": "TransConv - DDPM\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Employers in Pakistan can openly state preferences regarding gender, residential location, and other characteristics, but the majority in the information technology sector choose not to do so. This creates an opportunity to examine whether discrimination persists when such biases are not explicitly stated. An analysis of explicitly gender-targeted job ads shows that men are preferred over women across most occupations, even in traditionally pink-collar roles. Moreover, results from a resume audit experiment, submitting 2,032 applications to 508 full-time job openings, show that men receive more callbacks for job interviews than women, even in the absence of explicit gender preferences in job ads. The study also indicates a significant premium favoring candidates from high-income areas, who receive 45 percent more callbacks than applicants from low-income neighborhoods. This advantage remains robust even after controlling for commuting distance. Qualitative interviews with human resource officials suggest that employers associate productivity with both gender and neighborhood socioeconomic status. Residential address acts as a proxy for class background and signals education, skills, and perceived \"fit\" in professional settings. These perceptions may reinforce stereotypes, disadvantaging women and candidates from low-income backgrounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u5361\u62c9\u5947\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6027\u522b\u548c\u5c45\u4f4f\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u884c\u4e1a\u62db\u8058\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u522b\u548c\u5730\u533a\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u884c\u4e1a\u96c7\u4e3b\u672a\u660e\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u504f\u597d\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u522b\u548c\u5c45\u4f4f\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u660e\u786e\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u7684\u62db\u8058\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5305\u542b2032\u4efd\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u7b80\u5386\u5ba1\u6838\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u5b98\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570\u804c\u4e1a\u504f\u597d\u7537\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u6027\u522b\u504f\u597d\u65f6\u7537\u6027\u9762\u8bd5\u56de\u8c03\u66f4\u591a\uff1b\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u5730\u533a\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u56de\u8c03\u6bd4\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5730\u533a\u591a45%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u53d7\u901a\u52e4\u8ddd\u79bb\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c7\u4e3b\u5c06\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u548c\u793e\u533a\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u5973\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u80cc\u666f\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u3002"}}

We propose two methods that use iterated posterior linearization followed by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to sample the posterior distributions of such latent models with a particular focus on log-Gaussian gamma processes.

By reformulating MFVI as a constrained finite-sum problem, we develop a novel primal-dual algorithm based on an augmented Lagrangian formulation, termed primal-dual variational inference (PD-VI). PD-VI jointly updates global and local variational parameters in the evidence lower bound in a scalable manner. To further account for heterogeneous loss geometry across different variational parameter blocks, we introduce a block-preconditioned extension, P$^2$D-VI, which adapts the primal-dual updates to the geometry of each parameter block and improves both numerical robustness and practical efficiency. We establish convergence guarantees for both PD-VI and P$^2$D-VI under properly chosen constant step size, without relying on conjugacy assumptions or explicit bounded-variance conditions. In particular, we prove $O(1/T)$ convergence to a stationary point in general settings and linear convergence under strong convexity.

Our architecture empowers individual nodes to locally construct semantic representations of their operational context, iteratively aggregating embeddings through neighbor-based exchanges using GraphSAGE. This iterative local aggregation process results in a dynamically evolving global semantic abstraction called Knowledge Map, enabling coordinated decision-making without centralized control. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments under a distributed resource orchestration use case.

To address these challenges, we introduce ByteHouse (https://bytehouse.cloud), a cloud-native data warehouse designed for real-time multimodal data analytics. The storage layer integrates a unified table engine that provides a two-tier logical abstraction and physically consistent layout, SSD-backed cluster-scale cache (CrossCache) that supports shared caching across compute nodes, and virtual file system (NexusFS) that enable efficient local access on compute nodes. The compute layer supports analytical, batch, and incremental execution modes, with tailored optimizations for hybrid queries (e.g., runtime filtering over tiered vector indexes). The control layer coordinates global metadata and transactions, and features an effective optimizer enhanced by historical execution traces and AI-assisted plan selection. Evaluations on internal and standard workloads show that ByteHouse achieves significant efficiency improvement over existing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9762\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f01\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u6570\u636e\u4ed3\u5e93 ByteHouse\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f01\u4e1a\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u800c\u5b57\u8282\u8df3\u52a8\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728 I/O \u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u79bb\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5b58\u50a8\u5c42\u96c6\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u5f15\u64ce\u3001SSD \u96c6\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u865a\u62df\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c42\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u534f\u8c03\u5168\u5c40\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e8b\u52a1\uff0c\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c AI \u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cByteHouse \u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ByteHouse \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that this may be attributed to the inherent noise, bias, and incompleteness of raw user interaction data in prior continual pre-training (CPT) efforts. This paper introduces a novel, layered framework for generating high-quality synthetic data that circumvents such issues by creating a curated, pedagogical curriculum for the LLM. We provide powerful, direct evidence for the utility of our curriculum by showing that standard sequential models trained on our principled synthetic data significantly outperform ($+130\\%$ on recall@100 for SasRec) models trained on real data in downstream ranking tasks, demonstrating its superiority for learning generalizable user preference patterns. Building on this, we empirically demonstrate, for the first time, robust power-law scaling for an LLM that is continually pre-trained on our high-quality, recommendation-specific data. Our experiments reveal consistent and predictable perplexity reduction across multiple synthetic data modalities.

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models.

We focus on the well-known $\u03b1$-EFX fairness criterion, according to which the envy of an agent for another agent is bounded multiplicatively by $\u03b1$, after the removal of any good from the envied agent's bundle. The vast majority of the literature has studied $\u03b1$-EFX allocations under the assumption that full knowledge of the valuation functions of the agents is available. Motivated by the established literature on the distortion in social choice, we instead consider $\u03b1$-EFX algorithms that operate under limited information on these functions. In particular, we assume that the algorithm has access to the ordinal preference rankings, and is allowed to make a small number of queries to obtain further access to the underlying values of the agents for the goods. We show (near-optimal) tradeoffs between the values of $\u03b1$ and the number of queries required to achieve those, with a particular focus on constant EFX approximations. We also consider two interesting special cases, namely instances with a constant number of agents, or with two possible values, and provide improved positive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u6563\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u7684\u03b1 - EFX\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u03b1\u503c\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u6743\u8861\u53ca\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u5f80\u6587\u732e\u591a\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u4e86\u89e3\u4f30\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u03b1 - EFX\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u53d7\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u5931\u771f\u7814\u7a76\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u03b1 - EFX\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5047\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u5e8f\u504f\u597d\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5c11\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\u83b7\u53d6\u7269\u54c1\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u03b1\u503c\u548c\u6240\u9700\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u7684\uff08\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff09\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u5e38\u6570EFX\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u7ed9\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u03b1 - EFX\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

The potential of large language models (LLMs) for automatic generation of modeling code has been demonstrated.

In this work, we propose a spiking Bayesian neural network (SBNN) framework that unifies the dynamic models of intrinsic device stochasticity (based on Magnetic Tunnel Junctions) and stochastic threshold neurons to leverage noise as a functional Bayesian resource. Experiments demonstrate that SBNN achieves high accuracy (99.16% on MNIST, 94.84% on CIFAR10) with 8-bit precision. Meanwhile rate estimation method provides a ~20-fold training speedup. Furthermore, SBNN exhibits superior robustness, showing a 67% accuracy improvement under synaptic weight noise and 12% under input noise compared to standard spiking neural networks.

Although recent multimodal large language models have shown strong performance on this task, two key challenges remain - spurious associations between emotions and irrelevant audiovisual cues, and hallucinations of audiovisual cues driven by text priors in the language model backbone. To quantify and understand these issues, we introduce EmoReAlM, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs for cue-emotion associations, hallucinations and modality agreement. We then propose AVEm-DPO, a preference optimization technique that aligns model responses with both audiovisual inputs and emotion-centric queries. Specifically, we construct preferences over responses exhibiting spurious associations or hallucinations, and audiovisual input pairs guided by textual prompts. We also include a regularization term that penalizes reliance on text priors, thereby mitigating modality-specific cue hallucinations. Experimental results on DFEW, RAVDESS and EMER demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the reference baseline models with 6-19% of relative performance gains in zero-shot settings.

Despite their significance, the vast majority of the empirical literature on cryptocurrencies focuses on on-chain transactions. This paper presents one of the first analysis of both on- and off-chain demand- and supply-side factors. Two hypotheses relating on-chain and off-chain demand and supply drivers to the Bitcoin price are tested in an ARDL model with daily data from 2019 to 2024. Our estimates document the differential contributions of on-chain and off-chain drivers on the Bitcoin price. Off-chain demand pressures have a significant impact on the Bitcoin price in the long-run. In the short-run, both demand and supply drivers significantly affect the Bitcoin price. Regarding transactions on the blockchain, only on-chain demand pressures are statistically significant - both in the long- and short-run. These findings confirm the dual nature of the Bitcoin price dynamics, where also market fundamentals affect the Bitcoin price in addition to speculative drivers.

Classical frequentist inference, however, presumes that the set of covariates is fixed in advance and does not account for data-driven variable selection. As a consequence, naive post-selection inference may be biased and misleading. In right-censored survival settings, these issues may be further exacerbated by the additional uncertainty induced by censoring. We investigate several inference procedures applied after variable selection for the coefficients of the Lasso and its extension, the adaptive Lasso, in the context of the Cox model. The methods considered include sample splitting, exact post-selection inference, and the debiased Lasso. Their performance is examined in a neutral simulation study reflecting realistic covariate structures and censoring rates commonly encountered in biomedical applications.

In low dimensions these sets are easy to interpret, but in high-dimensional or structured output spaces they are difficult to represent and use, which can limit their ability to integrate with downstream tasks such as sampling and probabilistic forecasting. We show that any differentiable nonconformity score induces a deterministic flow on the output space whose trajectories converge to the boundary of the corresponding conformal prediction set. This leads to a computationally efficient, training-free method for sampling conformal boundaries in arbitrary dimensions. Boundary samples can be reconformalized to form pointwise prediction sets with controlled risk, and mixing across confidence levels yields conformal predictive distributions whose quantile regions coincide exactly with conformal prediction sets.

This complexity is further amplified for bio-inspired configurations, whose rich geometric parametrizations lead to high-dimensional design spaces that are difficult to explore using conventional optimization approaches. This work presents a ML-enabled bi-level multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) framework for the performance-driven design of a manta-ray-inspired AUG. At the upper level, hydrodynamically efficient external geometries are explored in a reduced design space obtained through physics-driven parametric model embedding, which identifies a low-dimensional latent representation directly correlated with the lift, drag, and pressure distributions. At the lower level, a constrained internal sizing problem determines the minimum feasible empty weight by accounting for structural, hydrostatic, geometric, and payload constraints. To render the resulting bi-level problem computationally tractable, a multi-fidelity surrogate-based optimization strategy is adopted, combining low- and high-fidelity hydrodynamic models with stochastic radial basis function surrogates and adaptive Bayesian sampling. The framework enables efficient exploration of the coupled design space while rigorously managing model uncertainty and computational cost. The optimized configurations exhibit a 14.7\\% improvement in maximum hydrodynamic efficiency and a 12.8\\% reduction in empty weight relative to the baseline design, while satisfying all disciplinary constraints.

It is known that any deterministic rule suffers distortion of at least $3$, and that randomized rules can achieve distortion strictly less than $3$, often at the cost of reduced transparency and interpretability. In this work, we explore the trade-off between these paradigms by asking whether it is possible to break the distortion barrier of $3$ using only \"bounded\" randomness. We answer in the affirmative by presenting a voting rule that (1) achieves distortion of at most $3 - \\varepsilon$ for some absolute constant $\\varepsilon > 0$, and (2) selects a winner uniformly at random from a deterministically identified list of constant size. Our analysis builds on new structural results for the distortion and approximation of Maximal Lotteries and Stable Lotteries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5ea6\u91cf\u5931\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u7528\u6709\u754c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6253\u78343\u7684\u5931\u771f\u5c4f\u969c\u7684\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u968f\u673a\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7528\u6709\u754c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6253\u78343\u7684\u5931\u771f\u5c4f\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5f69\u7968\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f69\u7968\u7684\u5931\u771f\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u65b0\u7ed3\u6784\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u81f3\u591a3 - \u03b5\uff08\u03b5>0\uff09\u7684\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4e14\u4ece\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u5e38\u89c4\u6a21\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u9009\u83b7\u80dc\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u754c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6253\u78343\u7684\u5931\u771f\u5c4f\u969c\u3002"}}

While fractional Brownian motion has been widely used as a noise source to capture such memory effects, its incompatibility with It\u00f4 calculus limits its applicability in neural stochastic differential equation~(SDE) frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel class of noise, termed Neural Network-kernel ARMA-type noise~(NA-noise), which is an It\u00f4-process-based alternative capable of capturing both long- and short-memory behaviors. The kernel function defining the noise structure is parameterized via neural networks and decomposed into a product form to preserve the Markov property. Based on this noise process, we develop NANSDE-Net, a generative model that extends Neural SDEs by incorporating NA-noise. We prove the theoretical existence and uniqueness of the solution under mild conditions and derive an efficient backpropagation scheme for training.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for code generation [Chen et al., 2021; Huynh and Lin, 2025], their effectiveness in domain-specific enterprise contexts remains underexplored, particularly when both retrieval and modification tasks must be handled jointly. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of three retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) variants [Lewis et al., 2021] -- standard RAG, Self-RAG [Asai et al., 2024], and CoRAG [Wang et al., 2025] -- across SQL query generation, REST API call generation, and a combined task requiring dynamic task classification. Using SAP Transactional Banking as a realistic enterprise use case, we construct a novel test dataset covering both modalities and evaluate 18 experimental configurations under database-only, API-only, and hybrid documentation contexts. Results demonstrate that RAG is essential: Without retrieval, exact match accuracy is 0% across all tasks, whereas retrieval yields substantial gains in execution accuracy (up to 79.30%) and component match accuracy (up to 78.86%). Critically, CoRAG proves most robust in hybrid documentation settings, achieving statistically significant improvements in the combined task (10.29% exact match vs. 7.45% for standard RAG), driven primarily by superior SQL generation performance (15.32% vs. 11.56%).

In this paper, we study the reproducibility practices in papers published in the Evolutionary Combinatorial Optimization and Metaheuristics track of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference over a ten-year period.

In addition, we propose RECAP (REproducibility Checklist Automation Pipeline), an LLM-based system that automatically evaluates reproducibility signals from paper text and associated code repositories. Our analysis shows that papers achieve an average completeness score of 0.62, and that 36.90% of them provide additional material beyond the manuscript itself.

Key results on 1 million synthetic maze pairs include:\n  - 192x reduction in training loss over 100 epochs\n  - 22.7x improvement in L2 distance to ground truth\n  - Only 10 Euler steps required (vs. 100-1000 for typical diffusion models)\n  Quantitative analysis reveals a striking phase transition phenomenon: the solution remains invisible for 68% of the transformation (zero recall), then emerges abruptly at t=0.70 within just 2% of the process. Most remarkably, 100% of samples exhibit simultaneous emergence across all spatial regions, ruling out sequential path construction and providing evidence for holistic rather than algorithmic reasoning.

Rerandomization addresses this by repeatedly generating treatment assignments until covariate balance meets a prespecified threshold. By shrinking this threshold, it can achieve arbitrarily strong balance, with established results guaranteeing optimal estimation and valid inference in both finite-sample and asymptotic settings across diverse complex experimental settings. Despite its rigorous theoretical foundations, practical use is limited by the extreme inefficiency of rejection sampling, which becomes prohibitively slow under small thresholds and often forces practitioners to adopt suboptimal settings, leading to degraded performance. Existing work focusing on acceleration typically fail to maintain the uniformity over the acceptable assignment space, thus losing the theoretical grounds of classical rerandomization. Building upon a Metropolis-Hastings framework, we address this challenge by introducing an additional sampling-importance resampling step, which restores uniformity and preserves statistical guarantees.

Along the way, we identify a sharp geometric contrast. Namely, in doubling spaces, including all finite-dimensional normed spaces, generatability is stable across novelty scales and invariant under equivalent metrics.

In today's environment, it is crucial to develop light-weight mechanisms that recover a distributed system from faults quickly and with only a small impact on the live-system throughput. To address this need, this paper proposes a new low-overhead, general recovery scheme for modern non-transactional leaderless distributed systems. We call our scheme HEAL. On a node failure, HEAL performs an optimized online incremental recovery. This paper presents HEAL's algorithms for settings with Linearizable consistency and different memory persistency models. We implement HEAL on a 6-node Intel cluster. Our experiments running TAOBench workloads show that HEAL is very effective. HEAL recovers the cluster in 120 milliseconds on average, while reducing the throughput of the running workload by an average of 8.7%. In contrast, a conventional recovery scheme for leaderless systems needs 360 seconds to recover, reducing the throughput of the system by 16.2%. Finally, compared to an incremental recovery scheme for a state-of-the-art leader-based system, HEAL reduces the average recovery latency by 20.7x and the throughput degradation by 62.4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u65e0\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6848HEAL\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6062\u590d\u5feb\u3001\u5bf9\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u4ece\u6545\u969c\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4e14\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHEAL\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u589e\u91cf\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u57286\u8282\u70b9Intel\u96c6\u7fa4\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHEAL\u5e73\u5747120\u6beb\u79d2\u6062\u590d\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e8.7%\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u9700360\u79d2\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e16.2%\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6848\uff0cHEAL\u5e73\u5747\u6062\u590d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e20.7\u500d\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u964d\u4f4e62.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "HEAL\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u6062\u590d\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5bf9\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, adaptively tuning this trade-off typically requires rebuilding the index for different $\u03b1$ values, which is prohibitive at scale. In this work, we propose RP-Tuning, an efficient post-hoc routine, based on DiskANN's pruning step, to adjust the $\u03b1$ parameter without reconstructing the full index. Within the $\u03b1$-reachability framework of prior theoretical works (Indyk and Xu, 2023; Gollapudi et al., 2025), we prove that pruning an initially $\u03b1$-reachable graph with RP-Tuning preserves worst-case reachability guarantees in general metrics and improved guarantees in Euclidean metrics. Empirically, we show that RP-Tuning accelerates DiskANN tuning on four public datasets by up to $43\\times$ with negligible overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRP - Tuning\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u5efa\u7d22\u5f15\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8c03\u6574DiskANN\u7684\u03b1\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DiskANN\u7684\u03b1\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u9700\u91cd\u5efa\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eDiskANN\u7684\u526a\u679d\u6b65\u9aa4\u63d0\u51faRP - Tuning\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728\u03b1 - \u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "RP - Tuning\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u52a0\u901fDiskANN\u8c03\u53c2\u8fbe43\u500d\uff0c\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "RP - Tuning\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u5efa\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8c03\u6574\u03b1\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u53c2\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To support grounded prospective reflection, we distill planning errors from historical agent trajectories, capturing recurring success and failure patterns observed across past executions. Furthermore, we complement prospective reflection with a dynamic re-planning mechanism that provides execution-time plan update in case the original plan encounters unexpected deviation.

Understanding the quality issues students introduce in MSAs is essential to improve education. This study analyzes student-developed microservices using an established anti-pattern taxonomy and derives lessons learned with actionable teaching recommendations. We conducted a longitudinal, project-based course (2023-2025) involving 216 Master's students (67 teams) who designed and deployed a realistic, containerized MSA for a gamified testing platform. The final systems revealed 23 out of 58 known MSA anti-patterns, spanning five categories. Security issues were most frequent, highlighting weaknesses in authentication, authorization, and data protection. Team Organization and Service Interaction problems followed, reflecting limited DevOps experience and difficulties in inter-service coordination. Fewer issues appeared in Intra-service Design and Inter-service Decomposition, suggesting students generally defined service boundaries well.

While reinforcement learning (RL) achieves high performance in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) optimization, it typically produces opaque \"black-box\" neural networks that are difficult for consumers and regulators to audit. Addressing this interpretability gap, we propose a program search framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent mutation operators within an iterative prompt-evaluation-repair loop. Utilizing the high-fidelity EV2Gym simulation environment as a fitness function, the system undergoes successive refinement cycles to synthesize executable Python policies that balance profit maximization, user comfort, and physical safety constraints. We benchmark four prompting strategies: Imitation, Reasoning, Hybrid and Runtime, evaluating their ability to discover adaptive control logic. Results demonstrate that the Hybrid strategy produces concise, human-readable heuristics that achieve 118% of the baseline profit, effectively discovering complex behaviors like anticipatory arbitrage and hysteresis without explicit programming.

This thesis presents EMSYNC (EMotion and SYNChronization), a fast, free, and automatic solution that generates music tailored to the input video, enabling content creators to enhance their productions without composing or licensing music. Our model creates music that is emotionally and rhythmically synchronized with the video. A core component of EMSYNC is a novel video emotion classifier. By leveraging pretrained deep neural networks for feature extraction and keeping them frozen while training only fusion layers, we reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy. We show the generalization abilities of our method by obtaining state-of-the-art results on Ekman-6 and MovieNet. Another key contribution is a large-scale, emotion-labeled MIDI dataset for affective music generation. We then present an emotion-based MIDI generator, the first to condition on continuous emotional values rather than discrete categories, enabling nuanced music generation aligned with complex emotional content. To enhance temporal synchronization, we introduce a novel temporal boundary conditioning method, called \"boundary offset encodings,\" aligning musical chords with scene changes. Combining video emotion classification, emotion-based music generation, and temporal boundary conditioning, EMSYNC emerges as a fully automatic video-based music generator.

In February 2024, Lyft began a staggered rollout of a new policy that guaranteed drivers a minimum share of rider payments and increased transparency by displaying estimated earnings per ride upfront. This policy was first introduced in major urban markets, creating a natural experiment to evaluate its effects. Using data from over 47 million rides across urban and neighboring suburban markets, we apply dynamic staggered difference-in-differences and geographic border strategies to measure causal effects on driver behavior, rider experience, and platform performance. We find the policy significantly increased driver engagement-particularly among those with lower pre-policy earnings or higher income uncertainty-leading to more hours worked, higher utilization, and greater trip volume. These supply-side changes also generated positive spillovers on rider demand. We disentangle the separate effects of earnings guarantees and transparency and show that while both were beneficial, transparency may have also triggered strategic driver behaviors. In ongoing work, we develop a counterfactual simulation framework linking driver supply and rider intents to ride production, showing how small behavioral shifts could further amplify platform outcomes. We also train a self-supervised model on driver trajectories to detect multihoming, examining whether the observed supply increase reflects net expansion or substitution from other platforms.

We address both issues in the full-data (batch) regime. First, we derive a batch minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm for softmax-gated multinomial-logistic MoE using an explicit quadratic minorizer, yielding coordinate-wise closed-form updates that guarantee monotone ascent of the objective and global convergence to a stationary point (in the standard MM sense), avoiding approximate M-steps common in EM-type implementations. Second, we prove finite-sample rates for conditional density estimation and parameter recovery, and we adapt dendrograms of mixing measures to the classification setting to obtain a sweep-free selector of the number of experts that achieves near-parametric optimal rates after merging redundant fitted atoms.

While Thompson Sampling (TS) is a preferred strategy for these problems, its performance hinges on the quality of the underlying reward model. Standard linear models suffer from high bias, while neural network approaches are often brittle and difficult to tune in online settings. Conversely, tree ensembles dominate tabular data prediction but typically rely on heuristic uncertainty quantification, lacking a principled probabilistic basis for TS. We propose Bayesian Forest Thompson Sampling (BFTS), the first contextual bandit algorithm to integrate Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), a fully probabilistic sum-of-trees model, directly into the exploration loop. We prove that BFTS is theoretically sound, deriving an information-theoretic Bayesian regret bound of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$. As a complementary result, we establish frequentist minimax optimality for a \"feel-good\" variant, confirming the structural suitability of BART priors for non-parametric bandits. Empirically, BFTS achieves state-of-the-art regret on tabular benchmarks with near-nominal uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, in an offline policy evaluation on the Drink Less micro-randomized trial, BFTS improves engagement rates by over 30% compared to the deployed policy, demonstrating its practical effectiveness for behavioral interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This enables shared-memory semantics for distributed computing, but introduces new resilience challenges: a node failure leads to the loss of the dirty data in its caches, corrupting application state. Unfortunately, the CXL specification does not consider processor failures. Moreover, when a component fails, the specification tries to isolate it and continue application execution; there is no attempt to bring the application to a consistent state. To address these limitations, this paper extends the CXL specification to be resilient to node failures, and to correctly recover the application after node failures. We call the system ReCXL. To handle the failure of nodes, ReCXL augments the coherence transaction of a write with messages that propagate the update to a small set of other nodes (i.e., Replicas). Replicas save the update in a hardware Logging Unit. Such replication ensures resilience to node failures. Then, at regular intervals, the Logging Units dump the updates to memory. Recovery involves using the logs in the Logging Units to bring the directory and memory to a correct state.

To the extent that the analyst's goals are based on an intention on what to discover (e.g., contrast a query result to peer ones, verify a pattern to a broader range of data in the data space, etc), the integration of intentional query operators in analytical engines can enhance the efficiency of these analytical tasks. In this paper, we introduce, with well-defined semantics, the ANALYZE operator, a novel cube querying intentional operator that provides a 360 view of data. We define the semantics of an ANALYZE query as a tuple of five internal, facilitator cube queries, that (a) report on the specifics of a particular subset of the data space, which is part of the query specification, and to which we refer as the original query, (b) contrast the result with results from peer-subspaces, or sibling queries, and, (c) explore the data space in lower levels of granularity via drill-down queries. We introduce formal query semantics for the operator and we theoretically prove that we can obtain the exact same result by merging the facilitator cube queries into a smaller number of queries. This effectively introduces a multi-query optimization (MQO) strategy for executing an ANALYZE query. We propose three alternative algorithms, (a) a simple execution without optimizations (Min-MQO), (b) a total merging of all the facilitator queries to a single one (Max-MQO), and (c) an intermediate strategy, Mid-MQO, that merges only a subset of the facilitator queries. Our experimentation demonstrates that Mid-MQO achieves consistently strong performance across several contexts, Min-MQO always follows it, and Max-MQO excels for queries where the siblings are sizable and significantly overlap.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684ANALYZE\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMid - MQO\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u5728\u67e5\u627e\u6570\u636e\u4eae\u70b9\u65f6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u610f\u67e5\u8be2\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u64ce\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ANALYZE\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u67e5\u8be2\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u5185\u90e8\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5668\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u53caMin - MQO\u3001Max - MQO\u3001Mid - MQO\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMid - MQO\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cMin - MQO\u6b21\u4e4b\uff0cMax - MQO\u5728\u5144\u5f1f\u67e5\u8be2\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u4e14\u91cd\u53e0\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "ANALYZE\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a label set of size $L$, and local reward functions $f_v$ accessed via evaluation oracles, the objective is to assign labels to maximize $\\sum_{v \\in V} f_v(x_{N[v]})$, where each term depends on the closed neighborhood of $v$. Two vertices co-occur in some neighborhood term exactly when their distance in $G$ is at most $2$, so the dependency graph is the squared graph $G^2$ and $\\mathrm{tw}(G^2)$ governs exact algorithms and matching fine-grained lower bounds. Accordingly, we show that this dependence is inherent: NAGL is NP-hard even on star graphs with binary labels and, assuming SETH, admits no $(L-\\varepsilon)^{\\mathrm{tw}(G^2)}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for any $\\varepsilon>0$. We match this with an exact dynamic program on a tree decomposition of $G^2$ running in $O\\!\\left(n\\cdot \\mathrm{tw}(G^2)\\cdot L^{\\mathrm{tw}(G^2)+1}\\right)$ time.

We find clear evidence of developer-specific efficiency advantages, but their importance depends on where models lie in the performance distribution. At the frontier, 80-90% of performance differences are explained by higher training compute, implying that scale--not proprietary technology--drives frontier advances. Away from the frontier, however, proprietary techniques and shared algorithmic progress substantially reduce the compute required to reach fixed capability thresholds.

Yet while architectural complexity has been studied, the structural complexity embedded within requirements specifications remains poorly understood and inadequately quantified. This gap is consequential: requirements fundamentally drive system design, and complexity introduced at this stage propagates through architecture, implementation, and integration. To address this gap, we build on Natural Language Processing methods that extract structural networks from textual requirements. Using these extracted structures, we conducted a controlled experiment employing molecular integration tasks as structurally isomorphic proxies for requirements integration - leveraging the topological equivalence between molecular graphs and requirement networks while eliminating confounding factors such as domain expertise and semantic ambiguity. Our results demonstrate that spectral measures predict integration effort with correlations exceeding 0.95, while structural metrics achieve correlations above 0.89.

WDS include complex fluid interactions that are nonlinear and noisy, making such maintenance a challenging problem for traditional control algorithms. This paper proposes an evolutionary framework to this problem based on neuroevolution, multi-objective optimization, and surrogate modeling. Neural networks were evolved with NEAT to inject chlorine at strategic locations in the distribution network at select times. NSGA-II was employed to optimize four objectives: minimizing the total amount of chlorine injected, keeping chlorine concentrations homogeneous across the network, ensuring that maximum concentrations did not exceed safe bounds, and distributing the injections regularly over time. Each network was evaluated against a surrogate model, i.e. a neural network trained to emulate EPANET, an industry-level hydraulic WDS simulator that is accurate but infeasible in terms of computational cost to support machine learning. The evolved controllers produced a diverse range of Pareto-optimal policies that could be implemented in practice, outperforming standard reinforcement learning methods such as PPO.

We argue that this formulation is inefficient and lacks the structural inductive bias necessary for distinguishing between local feature preservation and global context integration. To address this, we introduce the Hybrid Dual-Path Linear (HDPL) operator, which decomposes the affine transformation into two topologically distinct pathways: a sparse block-diagonal component for high-rank local processing, and a low-rank Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck for global context regularization. By \"surgically\" replacing specific projections (Query, Key, Value, Gate, Up) with HDPL operators while retaining standard dense layers for aggregation (Output, Down), we achieve a superior balance of efficiency and representational power. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu dataset demonstrate that the HDPL architecture outperforms a standard Llama-style baseline, reducing validation loss while simultaneously reducing parameter count by 6.8%. Beyond immediate performance gains, we discuss how the explicit materialization of a probabilistic latent space within the Transformer backbone serves as a vital architectural affordance, offering new pathways for inference-time or hypernetwork induced control, continual adaptation, interpretability, and cross-model or cross-modal synchronization.

A detailed mRNA case study analyzes disruption scenarios for a facility targeting 50 million doses: facility shutdowns, workforce reductions, raw material shortages, infrastructure failures, extended procurement lead times, and increased QA/QC capacity. Three main insights emerge. First, QA/QC personnel are the primary bottleneck, with utilization reaching 84.5% under normal conditions while machine utilization remains below 33%. Doubling QA/QC capacity increases annual output by 79.1%, offering greater returns than equipment investments. Second, raw material disruptions are highly detrimental, with extended lead times reducing three-year output by 19.6% and causing stockouts during 51.8% of production time.

To mitigate extensive request timeouts caused by accumulation, systems for inference pipelines commonly drop a subset of requests so the remaining ones can satisfy latency constraints. Since it is commonly believed that request dropping adversely affects goodput, existing systems only drop requests when they have to, which we call reactive dropping. However, this reactive policy can not maintain high goodput, as it neither makes timely dropping decisions nor identifies the proper set of requests to drop, leading to issues of dropping requests too late or dropping the wrong set of requests.\n  We propose that the inference system should proactively drop certain requests in advance to enhance the goodput across the entire workload. To achieve this, we design an inference system PARD. It enhances goodput with timely and precise dropping decisions by integrating a proactive dropping method that decides when to drop requests using runtime information of the inference pipeline, and an adaptive request priority mechanism that selects which specific requests to drop based on remaining latency budgets and workload intensity. Evaluation on a cluster of 64 GPUs over real-world workloads shows that PARD achieves $16\\%$-$176\\%$ higher goodput than the state of the art while reducing the drop rate and wasted computation resources by $1.6\\times$-$17\\times$ and $1.5\\times$-$62\\times$ respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u88ab\u52a8\u4e22\u5f03\u8bf7\u6c42\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e22\u5f03\u8bf7\u6c42\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf PARD\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e22\u5f03\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u4e22\u5f03\u8bf7\u6c42\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e22\u5f03\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u53ca\u65f6\u548c\u4e22\u5f03\u9519\u8bef\u8bf7\u6c42\u96c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf PARD\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e22\u5f03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6839\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u4e22\u5f03\u8bf7\u6c42\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bf7\u6c42\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\uff08\u6839\u636e\u5269\u4f59\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u4e22\u5f03\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728 64 \u4e2a GPU \u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cPARD \u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u9ad8 16% - 176%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e22\u5f03\u7387\u548c\u6d6a\u8d39\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e 1.6 - 17 \u500d\u548c 1.5 - 62 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e22\u5f03\u8bf7\u6c42\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose a unified \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{D}istribution \\textbf{L}earning (MDL) framework, inspired by the \"prompting\" paradigm in large language models (LLMs). MDL treats scenario and task information as specialized tokens rather than auxiliary inputs or gating signals. Specifically, we introduce a unified information tokenization module that transforms features, scenarios, and tasks into a unified tokenized format. To facilitate deep interaction, we design three synergistic mechanisms: (1) feature token self-attention for rich feature interactions, (2) domain-feature attention for scenario/task-adaptive feature activation, and (3) domain-fused aggregation for joint distribution prediction. By stacking these interactions, MDL enables scenario and task information to \"prompt\" and activate the model's vast parameter space in a bottom-up, layer-wise manner. Extensive experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that MDL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MSL and MTL baselines.

While existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance in question-answering tasks, they remain less effective on tasks requiring reasoning. In this work, we revisit hallucination detection through the lens of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a well-studied problem in areas like computer vision. Treating next-token prediction in language models as a classification task allows us to apply OOD techniques, provided appropriate modifications are made to account for the structural differences in large language models.

A key advantage of these models is that they can be trained exclusively on linear elastic data and then generalized to nonlinear inelastic regimes during online prediction. Despite their growing adoption, systematic evaluations of their performance across the full offline-online pipeline remain limited. This work presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of DMNs with respect to prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and training robustness. We investigate the effects of offline training choices, including initialization, batch size, training data size, and activation regularization on online generalization performance and uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both prediction error and variance decrease with increasing training data size, while initialization and batch size can significantly influence model performance. Moreover, activation regularization is shown to play a critical role in controlling network complexity and therefore generalization performance. Compared with the original DMN, the rotation-free Interaction-based Material Network (IMN) formulation achieves a 3.4x - 4.7x speed-up in offline training, while maintaining comparable online prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

In this setting, Tian et al. (2021) show that achieving no-external-regret is impossible without incurring an exponential dependence on the episode length $H$. They then turn to the weaker notion of Nash-value regret and propose a V-learning algorithm with regret $O(K^{2/3})$ after $K$ episodes. However, their algorithm and guarantee do not adapt to the difficulty of the problem: even in the case where the opponent follows a fixed policy and thus $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret is well-known to be achievable, their result is still the worse rate $O(K^{2/3})$ on a weaker metric.\n  In this work, we fully address both limitations. First, we introduce empirical Nash-value regret, a new regret notion that is strictly stronger than Nash-value regret and naturally reduces to external regret when the opponent follows a fixed policy. Moreover, under this new metric, we propose a parameter-free algorithm that achieves an $O(\\min \\{\\sqrt{K} + (CK)^{1/3},\\sqrt{LK}\\})$ regret bound, where $C$ quantifies the variance of the opponent's policies and $L$ denotes the number of policy switches (both at most $O(K)$). Therefore, our results not only recover the two extremes -- $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret when the opponent is fixed and $O(K^{2/3})$ Nash-value regret in the worst case -- but also smoothly interpolate between these extremes by automatically adapting to the opponent's non-stationarity. We achieve so by first providing a new analysis of the epoch-based V-learning algorithm by Mao et al. (2022), establishing an $O(\u03b7C + \\sqrt{K/\u03b7})$ regret bound, where $\u03b7$ is the epoch incremental factor. Next, we show how to adaptively restart this algorithm with an appropriate $\u03b7$ in response to the potential non-stationarity of the opponent, eventually achieving our final results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u4eba\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u524d\u4eba\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u540e\u6094\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u6094\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u4eba\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0d\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u624b\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7eb3\u4ec0\u503c\u540e\u6094\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u7684\u540e\u6094\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6e\u6b21\u7684V - learning\u7b97\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u542f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0$O(\\min \\{\\sqrt{K} + (CK)^{1/3},\\sqrt{LK}\\})$\u540e\u6094\u754c\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u4e24\u79cd\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3002"}}

Published on this https URL: https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2026.3659508", "summary": "Neural architecture search (NAS) automates neural network design, improving efficiency over manual approaches. However, efficiently discovering high-performance neural network architectures that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in NAS. Existing methods often suffer from limited population diversity and inadequate exploration of the search space, particularly in regions with extreme complexity values. To address these challenges, we propose MOEA-BUS, an innovative multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on bi-population with uniform sampling for neural architecture search, aimed at simultaneously optimizing both accuracy and network complexity. In MOEA-BUS, a novel uniform sampling method is proposed to initialize the population, ensuring that architectures are distributed uniformly across the objective space. Furthermore, to enhance exploration, we deploy a bi-population framework where two populations evolve synergistically, facilitating comprehensive search space coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate MOEA-BUS's superiority, achieving top-1 accuracies of 98.39% on CIFAR-10, and 80.03% on ImageNet. Notably, it achieves 78.28% accuracy on ImageNet with only 446M MAdds. Ablation studies confirm that both uniform sampling and bi-population mechanisms enhance population diversity and performance. Additionally, in terms of the Kendall's tau coefficient, the SVM achieves an improvement of at least 0.035 compared to the other three commonly used machine learning models, and uniform sampling provided an enhancement of approximately 0.07.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u7684MOEA - BUS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728CIFAR - 10\u548cImageNet\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u79cd\u7fa4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3001\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMOEA - BUS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u79cd\u7fa4\u6846\u67b6\u8ba9\u4e24\u4e2a\u79cd\u7fa4\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR - 10\u548cImageNet\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u53cc\u79cd\u7fa4\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u79cd\u7fa4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff1bSVM\u5728\u80af\u5fb7\u5c14tau\u7cfb\u6570\u4e0a\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MOEA - BUS\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u53cc\u79cd\u7fa4\u673a\u5236\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

To mitigate this, a baseline is commonly introduced for advantage computation; however, traditional value models remain difficult to optimize, and standard group-based baselines overlook sequence heterogeneity. Although classic optimal baseline theory can achieve global variance reduction, it neglects token heterogeneity and requires prohibitive gradient-based computation. In this work, we derive the Optimal Token Baseline (OTB) from first principles, proving that gradient updates should be weighted inversely to their cumulative gradient norm. To ensure efficiency, we propose the Logit-Gradient Proxy that approximates the gradient norm using only forward-pass probabilities. Our method achieves training stability and matches the performance of large group sizes ($N=32$) with only $N=4$, reducing token consumption by over 65% across single-turn and tool-integrated reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u6fc0\u589e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u4ee4\u724c\u57fa\u7ebfOTB\u53caLogit - \u68af\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u6fc0\u589e\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u4ee4\u724c\u57fa\u7ebfOTB\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLogit - \u68af\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u7528\u524d\u5411\u6982\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53ea\u9700N = 4\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230N = 32\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8565%\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The model facilitates effective information propagation over time while seamlessly integrating spatial components within a dynamic framework, building a Markovian dependence structure between datasets at successive time instants. This structure supports flexible, high-dimensional modeling of complex dependence patterns, as commonly found in spatiotemporal phenomena, where computational challenges arise rapidly with increasing dimensions. The proposed approach further manages exact inference through predictive stacking, enhancing accuracy and interoperability. Combining sequential and parallel processing of temporal shards, each unit passes assimilated information forward, then back-smoothed to improve posterior estimates, incorporating all available information.

We frame this as an operator-design problem: learn a continuous program space where latent distance has behavioral meaning, then design mutation operators that exploit this structure without changing the evolutionary optimizer.\n  We make locality measurable by tracking action-level divergence under controlled latent perturbations, identifying an empirical trust region for behavior-local continuous variation. Using a compact trading-strategy DSL with four semantic components (long/short entry and exit), we learn a matching block-factorized embedding and compare isotropic Gaussian mutation over the full latent space to geometry-compiled mutation that restricts updates to semantically paired entry--exit subspaces and proposes directions using a learned flow-based model trained on logged mutation outcomes.\n  Under identical $(\u03bc+\u03bb)$ evolution strategies and fixed evaluation budgets across five assets, the learned mutation operator discovers strong strategies using an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and achieves the highest median out-of-sample Sharpe ratio. Although isotropic mutation occasionally attains higher peak performance, geometry-compiled mutation yields faster, more reliable progress, demonstrating that semantically aligned mutation can substantially improve search efficiency without modifying the underlying evolutionary algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9057\u4f20\u7f16\u7a0b\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f46\u7a81\u53d8\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7b97\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u7b97\u5b50\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u5e95\u5c42\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9057\u4f20\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c0f\u8bed\u6cd5\u7a81\u53d8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u5927\u5e45\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b97\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ea7\u5206\u6b67\u8861\u91cf\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5757\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5168\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7a81\u53d8\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7f16\u8bd1\u7a81\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u7b97\u5b50\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u5916\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u7f16\u8bd1\u7a81\u53d8\u8fdb\u5c55\u66f4\u5feb\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u7840\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In response, we propose a Multi-Agentic AI framework for latency- and fairness-aware multi-modal LM inference in mobile edge networks. Our solution includes a long-term planning agent, a short-term prompt scheduling agent, and multiple on-node LM deployment agents, all powered by foundation language models. These agents cooperatively optimize prompt routing and LM deployment through natural language reasoning over runtime telemetry and historical experience. To evaluate its performance, we further develop a city-wide testbed that supports network monitoring, containerized LM deployment, intra-server resource management, and inter-server communications. Experiments demonstrate that our solution reduces average latency by over 80% and improves fairness (Normalized Jain index) to 0.90 compared to other baselines.

The natural greedy algorithm guarantees $(k+1)$-approximation for this problem, and the state-of-the-art algorithm only improves this approximation ratio to $k$. We give a $\\frac{2k\\ln2}{1+\\ln2}+O(\\sqrt{k})<0.819k+O(\\sqrt{k})$ approximation for this problem. Our result is the first multiplicative improvement over the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for general $k$. We further show that our algorithm can be used to obtain roughly the same approximation ratio also for the more general problem in which the objective is not guaranteed to be monotone (the sublinear term in the approximation ratio becomes $O(k^{2/3})$ rather than $O(\\sqrt{k})$ in this case).\n  All of our results hold also when the $k$-matroid intersection constraint is replaced with a more general matroid $k$-parity constraint. Furthermore, unlike the case in many of the previous works, our algorithms run in time that is independent of $k$ and polynomial in the size of the ground set. Our algorithms are based on a hybrid greedy local search approach recently introduced by Singer and Thiery (STOC 2025) for the weighted matroid $k$-intersection problem, which is a special case of the problem we consider. Leveraging their approach in the submodular setting requires several non-trivial insights and algorithmic modifications since the marginals of a submodular function $f$, which correspond to the weights in the weighted case, are not independent of the algorithm's internal randomness.

Mirroring human intuition, the framework guides retrieval resource allocation dynamically. Furthermore, we design a bidirectional diffusion algorithm that navigates deductive paths to mine in-depth memories, emulating human reasoning processes.

Existing safety frameworks largely treat alignment as a static optimization problem (e.g., tuning models to desired behavior) while overlooking the dynamic, adversarial incentives that shape how data are collected, how models are evaluated, and how they are ultimately deployed. We propose a new perspective on AI safety grounded in Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs): a class of game-theoretic models designed for adversarial resource allocation under uncertainty. By viewing AI oversight as a strategic interaction between defenders (auditors, evaluators, and deployers) and attackers (malicious actors, misaligned contributors, or worst-case failure modes), SSGs provide a unifying framework for reasoning about incentive design, limited oversight capacity, and adversarial uncertainty across the AI lifecycle. We illustrate how this framework can inform (1) training-time auditing against data/feedback poisoning, (2) pre-deployment evaluation under constrained reviewer resources, and (3) robust multi-model deployment in adversarial environments.

In many propagation contexts, spreading processes are influenced by multiple interacting factors, such as information expression patterns, cultural contexts, living environments, cognitive preferences, and public policies, which are difficult to incorporate directly into classical modeling frameworks. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited strong capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation, enabling explicit perception of semantic content and contextual cues in spreading processes, thereby supporting the analysis of the different influencing factors. Beyond serving as external analytical tools, LLMs can also act as interactive agents embedded in propagation systems, potentially influencing spreading pathways and feedback structures. Consequently, the roles and impacts of LLMs on spreading dynamics have become an active and rapidly growing research area across multiple research disciplines. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in applying LLMs to the study of spreading dynamics across two representative domains: digital epidemics, such as misinformation and rumors, and biological epidemics, including infectious disease outbreaks. We first examine the foundations of epidemic modeling from a complex-systems perspective and discuss how LLM-based approaches relate to traditional frameworks. We then systematically review recent studies from three key perspectives, which are epidemic modeling, epidemic detection and surveillance, and epidemic prediction and management, to clarify how LLMs enhance these areas.

Despite significant advances in deep learning based registration methods, accurately aligning images with large deformations while preserving anatomical plausibility remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-Driven Framework for Non-Rigid Medical Image Registration (AD-RegNet) that employs attention mechanisms to guide the registration process. Our approach combines a 3D UNet backbone with bidirectional cross-attention, which establishes correspondences between moving and fixed images at multiple scales. We introduce a regional adaptive attention mechanism that focuses on anatomically relevant structures, along with a multi-resolution deformation field synthesis approach for accurate alignment. The method is evaluated on two distinct datasets: DIRLab for thoracic 4D CT scans and IXI for brain MRI scans, demonstrating its versatility across different anatomical structures and imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods on the IXI and DIRLab datasets.

However, existing work on mixed-logit pricing largely focuses on unconstrained settings, limiting its applicability in practice where prices are subject to business or regulatory constraints. We study the constrained pricing problem under multinomial and mixed logit demand models. For the multinomial logit model, corresponding to a single customer segment, we show that the constrained pricing problem admits a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) via a reformulation based on exponential cone programming, yielding an $\\varepsilon$-optimal solution in polynomial time. For finite mixed logit models with $T$ customer segments, we reformulate the problem as a bilinear exponential cone program with $O(T)$ bilinear terms. This structure enables a Branch-and-Bound algorithm whose complexity is exponential only in $T$. Consequently, constrained pricing under finite mixtures of logit admits a PTAS when the number of customer segments is bounded.

Starting from a log-linear edge-weight model, we derive closed-form expressions for the hitting-time probability mass function, its full moment hierarchy, and the observed Fisher information. The Fisher matrix of each seed node turns out to be rank-one, taking the quotient by its null space yields a low-dimensional, globally flat manifold that captures all identifiable directions of the model. Leveraging the geometry, we introduce a sensitivity score for unlabeled nodes that bounds, and in one-dimensional cases attains, the maximal first-order change in DRW betweenness under unit Fisher perturbations.

We investigate a quantum-classical approach based on the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), which interleaves shallow QAOA layers with variable elimination guided by measured single- and two-qubit correlators. For interference-aware channel assignment, we give a compact QUBO/Ising formulation in which pairwise interference induces same-channel couplings and one-hot constraints are enforced via quadratic penalties (or, optionally, constraint-preserving mixers). Within RQAOA, fixing high-confidence variables or relations reduces the problem dimension, stabilizes training, and concentrates measurement effort on a shrinking instance that is solved exactly once below a cutoff. On simulated instances of modest size, including a four-user, four-channel example, the method consistently returns feasible assignments and, for the demonstrated case, attains the global optimum.

In the dynamic setting, the graph is subject to adversarial edge updates, and the goal is to maintain explicitly an exact $(k, z)$-clustering solution in the induced shortest-path metric.\n  While efficient dynamic $k$-center approximation algorithms on graphs exist [Cruciani et al. SODA 2024], to the best of our knowledge, no prior work provides similar results for the dynamic $(k,z)$-clustering problem. As the main result of this paper, we develop a randomized incremental $(k, z)$-clustering algorithm that maintains with high probability a constant-factor approximation in a graph undergoing edge insertions with a total update time of $\\tilde O(k m^{1+o(1)}+ k^{1+\\frac{1}\u03bb} m)$, where $\u03bb\\geq 1$ is an arbitrary fixed constant. Our incremental algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, we maintain a constant-factor bicriteria approximate solution of size $\\tilde{O}(k)$ with a total update time of $m^{1+o(1)}$ over all adversarial edge insertions. This first stage is an intricate adaptation of the bicriteria approximation algorithm by Mettu and Plaxton [Machine Learning 2004] to incremental graphs. One of our key technical results is that the radii in their algorithm can be assumed to be non-decreasing while the approximation ratio remains constant, a property that may be of independent interest.\n  In the second stage, we maintain a constant-factor approximate $(k,z)$-clustering solution on a dynamic weighted instance induced by the bicriteria approximate solution.

Existing approaches often incur substantial computational overhead, making them difficult to deploy in large-scale industrial systems under strict latency constraints. Recent sparse activation scaling methods, such as Sparse Mixture-of-Experts, reduce computation by activating only a subset of parameters, but still suffer from high memory access costs and limited personalization capacity due to the large size and small number of experts. To address these challenges, we propose MSN, a memory-based sparse activation scaling framework for recommendation models. MSN dynamically retrieves personalized representations from a large parameterized memory and integrates them into downstream feature interaction modules via a memory gating mechanism, enabling fine-grained personalization with low computational overhead. To enable further expansion of the memory capacity while keeping both computational and memory access costs under control, MSN adopts a Product-Key Memory (PKM) mechanism, which factorizes the memory retrieval complexity from linear time to sub-linear complexity. In addition, normalization and over-parameterization techniques are introduced to maintain balanced memory utilization and prevent memory retrieval collapse. We further design customized Sparse-Gather operator and adopt the AirTopK operator to improve training and inference efficiency in industrial settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSN consistently improves recommendation performance while maintaining high efficiency.

Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone. Leveraging this alignment, we forecast frontier model capabilities in terms of human task length and independently reproduce METR's exponential scaling results, with the 50% solvable task horizon doubling approximately every 6 months.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBRIDGE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u96be\u5ea6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u65ad\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u91ca\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8de8\u57fa\u51c6\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u53c2\u6570\u903b\u8f91\u65af\u8482\u9879\u76ee\u53cd\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u6f5c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6f5c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63a8\u65ad\u4eba\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u91cd\u73b0METR\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "BRIDGE\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing studies have focused on punishments within a homogeneous population, paying little attention to cooperative dynamics in a situation where belonging to a subset is equally important to the actual strategy represented by an actor. To fill this gap, we here study a bipartite population where cooperator agents in a public goods game penalize exclusively those defectors who belong to the alternative subset. We find that cooperation can emerge and remain stable under symmetric intergroup punishment. In particular, at low punishment intensity and at a small value of the enhancement factor of the dilemma game, intergroup punishment promotes cooperation more effectively than a uniformly applied punishment. Moreover, intergroup punishment in bipartite populations tends to be more favorable for overall social welfare. When this incentive is balanced, cooperators can collectively restrain defectors of the alternative set via aggregate interactions in a randomly formed working group, offering a more effective incentive. Conversely, breaking the symmetry of intergroup punishment inhibits cooperation, as the imbalance creates an Achilles' heel in the enforcement structure. Our work, thus, reveals symmetry in intergroup punishment as a unifying principle behind cooperation across human and biological systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u5206\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u60e9\u7f5a\u5bf9\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u79f0\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u60e9\u7f5a\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\uff0c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5219\u6291\u5236\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u540c\u8d28\u7fa4\u4f53\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5b50\u96c6\u5f52\u5c5e\u5bf9\u5408\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u6b64\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u4e8c\u5206\u7fa4\u4f53\u91cc\uff0c\u4e00\u65b9\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u4ec5\u60e9\u7f5a\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u80cc\u53db\u8005\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e0b\u5408\u4f5c\u53ef\u51fa\u73b0\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f4e\u60e9\u7f5a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u589e\u5f3a\u56e0\u5b50\u65f6\uff0c\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u60e9\u7f5a\u6bd4\u7edf\u4e00\u60e9\u7f5a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\uff1b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5219\u6291\u5236\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u5408\u4f5c\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

We introduce a scalable pipeline that converts noisy pull request diffs into Search/Replace edit blocks through reconstruction and validation, resulting in the largest publicly available corpus of 2 million pull requests spanning 12 programming languages. Using this training signal, we perform a mid-training stage followed by an agentless-aligned supervised fine-tuning process with error-driven data augmentation. On SWE-bench, our model significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned baseline, achieving absolute improvements of 13.6% on SWE-bench Lite and 12.3% on SWE-bench Verified.

In this paper, we introduce the PTME methodology to study deep learning surrogates by analyzing their Precision, Time, Memory, and Energy consumption. We argue that only a combination of numerical and physical performance can lead to a surrogate that is both a trusted scientific substitute for the real problem and an efficient experimental artifact for scalable studies. Here, we propose different surrogates for a real problem in optimally organizing the network of traffic lights in European cities and perform a PTME study on the surrogates' sampling methods, dataset sizes, and resource consumption. We further use the built surrogates in new optimization metaheuristics for decision-making in real cities.

This paper presents \\textit{Wireless Streamlet}, a spectrum-aware and cognitive consensus protocol tailored for wireless edge IoT. Building on Streamlet's streamlined structure, we introduce a \\textit{Channel-Aware Leader Election (CALE)} mechanism. CALE serves as a verifiable cross-layer cognitive engine that leverages receiver-measured channel state information (CSI) piggybacked in signed votes to derive Byzantine-robust connectivity scores from notarization certificates, and deterministically selects a unique weighted leader per epoch from finalized history, thereby improving proposal dissemination reliability under deep fading. Complementing this cognitive adaptation, Wireless Streamlet exploits the single-hop broadcast medium and a deterministic TDMA voting schedule to achieve linear per-epoch on-air transmissions (slot complexity), ensuring deterministic spectral access. To address the communication-storage trade-off, we further propose a coded dual-chain architecture that decouples header-only consensus (State Chain) from payload data (Data Chain). By employing erasure coding and on-chain integrity commitments, the system minimizes redundant spectrum usage for data retrieval while ensuring availability. Experiments show that Wireless Streamlet achieves higher throughput and lower confirmation latency than representative baselines in lossy environments, while substantially reducing per-node storage, demonstrating the efficacy of integrating cognitive sensing into consensus logic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5171\u8bc6\u534f\u8baeWireless Streamlet\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u6709\u635f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfBFT\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u9891\u8c31\u62e5\u585e\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5171\u8bc6\u5b58\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u8fdb\u5ea6\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eStreamlet\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Channel - Aware Leader Election (CALE)\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5355\u8df3\u5e7f\u64ad\u4ecb\u8d28\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027TDMA\u6295\u7968\u8c03\u5ea6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7f16\u7801\u53cc\u94fe\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "Wireless Streamlet\u5728\u6709\u635f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6bd4\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u786e\u8ba4\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6bcf\u8282\u70b9\u5b58\u50a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u611f\u77e5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5171\u8bc6\u903b\u8f91\u4e2d\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002"}}

Federated prompt learning mitigates this issue by keeping the VLPM backbone frozen and collaboratively training lightweight prompt parameters. However, existing approaches typically enforce a unified prompt structure and length across clients, which is inadequate under practical client heterogeneity in both data distributions and system resources, and may further introduce conflicts between globally shared and locally optimal knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{SDFed}, a heterogeneous federated prompt learning framework that bridges Local-Global Discrepancy via Subspace Refinement and Divergence Control. SDFed maintains a fixed-length global prompt for efficient aggregation while allowing each client to learn a variable-length local prompt to better match its data characteristics and capacity. To mitigate local-global conflicts and facilitate effective knowledge transfer, SDFed introduces a subspace refinement method for local prompts and an information retention and divergence control strategy that preserves key local information while maintaining appropriate separability between global and local representations. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SDFed consistently improves performance and robustness in heterogeneous federated settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSDFed\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8054\u90a6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0b\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSDFed\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u672c\u5730\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u5dee\u5f02\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSDFed\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SDFed\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In recent years, Cartesian tree matching has attracted considerable attention, particularly due to its applications in time series analysis. Consider a text $T$ of length $n$ and a pattern $P$ of length $m$. In the exact Cartesian tree matching problem, the task is to find all length-$m$ fragments of $T$ whose Cartesian tree coincides with the Cartesian tree $CT(P)$ of the pattern. Although the exact version of the problem can be solved in linear time [Park et al., TCS 2020], it remains rather restrictive; for example, it is not robust to outliers in the pattern.\n  To overcome this limitation, we consider the approximate setting, where the goal is to identify all fragments of $T$ that are close to some string whose Cartesian tree matches $CT(P)$. In this work, we quantify closeness via the widely used Hamming distance metric. For a given integer parameter $k>0$, we present an algorithm that computes all fragments of $T$ that are at Hamming distance at most $k$ from a string whose Cartesian tree matches $CT(P)$. Our algorithm runs in time $\\mathcal O(n \\sqrt{m} \\cdot k^{2.5})$ for $k \\leq m^{1/5}$ and in time $\\mathcal O(nk^5)$ for $k \\geq m^{1/5}$, thereby improving upon the state-of-the-art $\\mathcal O(nmk)$-time algorithm of Kim and Han [TCS 2025] in the regime $k = o(m^{1/4})$.\n  On the way to our solution, we develop a toolbox of independent interest.

However, natural language exhibits hierarchical structure from broad topics to specific entities that Euclidean embeddings fail to preserve, causing semantically distant documents to appear spuriously similar and increasing hallucination risk. To address these limitations, we introduce hyperbolic dense retrieval, developing two model variants in the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space: HyTE-FH, a fully hyperbolic transformer, and HyTE-H, a hybrid architecture projecting pre-trained Euclidean embeddings into hyperbolic space. To prevent representational collapse during sequence aggregation, we introduce the Outward Einstein Midpoint, a geometry-aware pooling operator that provably preserves hierarchical structure. On MTEB, HyTE-FH outperforms equivalent Euclidean baselines, while on RAGBench, HyTE-H achieves up to 29% gains over Euclidean baselines in context relevance and answer relevance using substantially smaller models than current state-of-the-art retrievers.

First, high-fidelity, executable training environments are scarce: environments synthesized from real-world repositories are not diverse and scalable, while trajectories synthesized by LLMs suffer from hallucinations. Second, standard instruction tuning uses expert trajectories that rarely exhibit simple mistakes common to smaller models. This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop. Subsequently, we employ a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors during trajectory collection, synthesizing data rich in error-correction cycles. Fine-tuned on this TermiGen-generated dataset, our TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B achieves a 31.3% pass rate on TerminalBench.

When trying to turn these metrics into a single ranking, natural aggregation procedures can become incoherent or unstable to changes in the model set. We formalize this aggregation as a social choice problem where each metric induces a preference ranking over models on each dataset, and a benchmark operator aggregates these votes across metrics. While prior work has focused on Arrow's impossibility result, we argue that the impossibility often originates from pathological examples and identify sufficient conditions under which these disappear, and meaningful multi-criteria benchmarking becomes possible. In particular, we deal with three restrictions on the combinations of rankings and prove that on single-peaked, group-separable and distance-restricted preferences, the benchmark operator allows for the construction of well-behaved rankings of the involved models.

Despite remarkable progress, APR is still limited in generating overfitting patches, i.e., patches passing available test suites but incorrect. This issue, known as patch overfitting, has become a key concern in the APR community, with numerous approaches proposed to address it. Very recent work proposes a pre-trained language model (PLM)-based automated patch correctness assessment (APCA) approach, indicating the potential of such PLMs in reasoning about patch correctness. Despite being promising, it is still far from perfect due to various limitations, such as the training paradigm and training dataset. In this paper, we present ComPass, a PLM-based APCA approach that leverages contrastive learning and data augmentation to address the technical limitations of prior work. Our work is inspired by the opportunity to integrate contrastive learning with recent PLMs in the field of patch correctness assessment, where large-scale labeled patches are difficult to obtain. ComPass utilizes code transformation rules to generate semantic-preserving code snippets for both unlabeled pre-training corpus and labeled fine-tuning patches. ComPass then pre-trains PLMs with contrastive learning, which captures code features with the same semantics but different structures. ComPass finally integrates representation embeddings of patch code snippets and fine-tunes PLMs with a binary classifier jointly to assess patch code correctness. Experimental results on 2274 real-world patches from Defects4J demonstrate that ComPass achieves an accuracy of 88.35%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline APPT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ePLM\u7684APCA\u65b9\u6cd5ComPass\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8865\u4e01\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709APR\u5b58\u5728\u8865\u4e01\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8ePLM\u7684APCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u4e3a\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u5fae\u8c03\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3PLMs\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u96c6\u6210\u8865\u4e01\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8054\u5408\u5fae\u8c03PLMs\u3002", "result": "\u5728Defects4J\u76842274\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8865\u4e01\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cComPass\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe88.35%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebfAPPT\u3002", "conclusion": "ComPass\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u4e8ePLM\u7684APCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6280\u672f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u8865\u4e01\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

This work presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first comprehensive application of liquid neural networks for EEG-based emotion recognition. The proposed multimodal framework combines convolutional feature extraction, liquid neural networks with learnable time constants, and attention-guided fusion to model temporal EEG dynamics with complementary peripheral physiological and personality features. Dedicated subnetworks are used to process EEG features and auxiliary modalities, and a shared autoencoder-based fusion module is used to learn discriminative latent representations before classification. Subject-dependent experiments conducted on the PhyMER dataset across seven emotional classes achieve an accuracy of 95.45%, surpassing previously reported results. Furthermore, temporal attention analysis provides interpretable insights into emotion-specific temporal relevance, and t-SNE visualizations demonstrate enhanced class separability, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, statistical analysis of temporal dynamics confirms that the network self-organizes into distinct functional groups with specialized fast and slow neurons, proving it independently tunes learnable time constants and memory dominance to effectively capture complex emotion artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u6db2\u4f53\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5168\u9762\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728PhyMER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u3001\u5608\u6742\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e3b\u4f53\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u5e26\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u6db2\u4f53\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e13\u7528\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728PhyMER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8de8\u4e03\u4e2a\u60c5\u7eea\u7c7b\u522b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe95.45%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6790\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0ct - SNE\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\u7c7b\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\uff0c\u53ef\u72ec\u7acb\u8c03\u6574\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u5e38\u6570\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u7eea\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Debiased Identity Preference Optimization (DIPO) directly estimates human preference probabilities without imposing a parametric reward model.

Mobile edge computing (MEC) allows such devices to offload inference tasks to edge servers (ESs), yet introduces latency due to communication and serverside queuing, especially in multi-user environments. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware offloading framework that dynamically decides whether to perform inference locally or offload it to the ES, based on token-level uncertainty and resource constraints. We define a margin-based token-level uncertainty metric and demonstrate its correlation with model accuracy. Leveraging this metric, we design a greedy offloading algorithm (GOA) that minimizes delay while maintaining accuracy by prioritizing offloading for highuncertainty queries. Our experiments show that GOA consistently achieves a favorable trade-off, outperforming baseline strategies in both accuracy and latency across varying user densities, and operates with practical computation time.

In such recent applications, in addition to the relevance (similarity) of the returned neighbors, diversity among the neighbors is a central requirement. In this paper, we develop principled welfare-based formulations in NNS for realizing diversity across attributes. Our formulations are based on welfare functions -- from mathematical economics -- that satisfy central diversity (fairness) and relevance (economic efficiency) axioms. With a particular focus on Nash social welfare, we note that our welfare-based formulations provide objective functions that adaptively balance relevance and diversity in a query-dependent manner. Notably, such a balance was not present in the prior constraint-based approach, which forced a fixed level of diversity and optimized for relevance. In addition, our formulation provides a parametric way to control the trade-off between relevance and diversity, providing practitioners with flexibility to tailor search results to task-specific requirements. We develop efficient nearest neighbor algorithms with provable guarantees for the welfare-based objectives. Notably, our algorithm can be applied on top of any standard ANN method (i.e., use standard ANN method as a subroutine) to efficiently find neighbors that approximately maximize our welfare-based objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is practical and substantially improves diversity while maintaining high relevance of the retrieved neighbors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u798f\u5229\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\uff08NNS\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c5e\u6027\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728NNS\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u9664\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5916\uff0c\u90bb\u5c45\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u4e4b\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7684\u798f\u5229\u51fd\u6570\u5f00\u53d1NNS\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5Nash\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u4e3a\u91cd\u70b9\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6ANN\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u798f\u5229\u7684NNS\u516c\u5f0f\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

However, existing work has three key limitations: (1) most efforts focus on retrieval and ranking, while the reranking phase, critical for refining final recommendations, is largely overlooked; (2) LLMs are typically used in zero-shot or supervised fine-tuning settings, leaving their reasoning abilities, especially those enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) and high-quality reasoning data, underexploited; (3) items are commonly represented by non-semantic IDs, creating major scalability challenges in industrial systems with billions of identifiers. To address these gaps, we propose the Generative Reasoning Reranker (GR2), an end-to-end framework with a three-stage training pipeline tailored for reranking. First, a pretrained LLM is mid-trained on semantic IDs encoded from non-semantic IDs via a tokenizer achieving $\\ge$99% uniqueness. Next, a stronger larger-scale LLM generates high-quality reasoning traces through carefully designed prompting and rejection sampling, which are used for supervised fine-tuning to impart foundational reasoning skills. Finally, we apply Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO), enabling scalable RL supervision with verifiable rewards designed specifically for reranking. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate GR2's effectiveness: it surpasses the state-of-the-art OneRec-Think by 2.4% in Recall@5 and 1.3% in NDCG@5. Ablations confirm that advanced reasoning traces yield substantial gains across metrics. We further find that RL reward design is crucial in reranking: LLMs tend to exploit reward hacking by preserving item order, motivating conditional verifiable rewards to mitigate this behavior and optimize reranking performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGR2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc1\u660e\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u9636\u6bb5\u5ffd\u89c6\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3001\u975e\u8bed\u4e49ID\u8868\u793a\u7269\u54c1\u6709\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGR2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5229\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5e94\u7528DAPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cGR2\u5728\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6298\u635f\u7d2f\u79ef\u589e\u76ca\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5OneRec - Think\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u5e26\u6765\u6307\u6807\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u5bf9\u63a8\u8350\u6307\u6807\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%.

This research presents Neural Sentinel, a novel unified approach that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform license plate recognition, state classification, and vehicle attribute extraction through a single forward pass. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines. We introduce a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) continual learning framework that incorporates user corrections while preventing catastrophic forgetting through experience replay, maintaining a 70:30 ratio of original training data to correction samples. The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training. Through extensive experimentation on real world toll plaza imagery, we demonstrate that unified vision language approaches represent a paradigm shift in ALPR systems, offering superior accuracy, reduced architectural complexity, and emergent multi-task capabilities that traditional pipeline approaches cannot achieve.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNeural Sentinel\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6709HITL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u5408\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Vision Language Models (VLMs)\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03PaliGemma 3B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Low - Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Human - in - the - Loop (HITL)\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe92.3%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eEasyOCR\u548cPaddleOCR\uff1b\u5e73\u5747\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf152ms\uff0cECE\u4e3a0.048\uff1b\u80fd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\u662fALPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Many modern learning models, however -- including fixed-architecture neural networks equipped with non-quadratic norms -- naturally give rise to non-Hilbertian geometries that fall outside this setting. In Banach spaces, continuity of point-evaluation functionals alone is insufficient to guarantee feature representations or kernel-based learning formulations. In this work, we develop a functional-analytic framework for learning in Banach spaces based on the notion of featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces. We identify the precise structural conditions under which feature maps, kernel constructions, and representer-type results can be recovered beyond the Hilbertian regime. Within this framework, supervised learning is formulated as a minimal-norm interpolation or regularization problem, and existence results together with conditional representer theorems are established. We further extend the theory to vector-valued featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces and show that fixed-architecture neural networks naturally induce special instances of such spaces. This provides a unified function-space perspective on kernel methods and neural networks and clarifies when kernel-based learning principles extend beyond reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3aBanach\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u7acb\u6cdb\u51fd\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u975eHilbert\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u518d\u751f\u6838Hilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u800cBanach\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6838\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u518d\u751f\u6838Banach\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u6838\u6784\u9020\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u8303\u6570\u63d2\u503c\u6216\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u518d\u751f\u6838Banach\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u56fa\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u662f\u6b64\u7c7b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u6838\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u7406\u4f55\u65f6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u518d\u751f\u6838Hilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u5916\u3002"}}

We study this question by deriving the velocity field targeted by the empirical FM objective on sequential data, in the limit of perfect function approximation. For the Gaussian conditional paths commonly used in practice, we show that the implied sampler is an ODE whose dynamics constitutes a nonparametric, memory-augmented continuous-time dynamical system. The optimal field admits a closed-form expression as a similarity-weighted mixture of instantaneous velocities induced by past transitions, making the dataset dependence explicit and interpretable. This perspective positions neural FM models trained by stochastic optimization as parametric surrogates of an ideal nonparametric solution. Using the structure of the optimal field, we study sampling and approximation schemes that improve the efficiency and numerical robustness of ODE-based generation.

This raises a fundamental question: which models should be selected when forming an LLM ensemble? We formulate budgeted ensemble selection as maximizing the mutual information between the true label and predictions of the selected models. Furthermore, to explain why performance can saturate even with many models, we model the correlated errors of the models using Gaussian-copula and show an information-theoretic error floor for the performance of the ensemble. Motivated by these, we propose a simple greedy mutual-information selection algorithm that estimates the required information terms directly from data and iteratively builds an ensemble under a query budget.

We present \\textbf{SAGE} (Scalable AI Governance \\& Evaluation), a framework that operationalizes high-quality human product judgment as a scalable evaluation signal. At the core of SAGE is a bidirectional calibration loop where natural-language \\emph{Policy}, curated \\emph{Precedent}, and an \\emph{LLM Surrogate Judge} co-evolve. SAGE systematically resolves semantic ambiguities and misalignments, transforming subjective relevance judgment into an executable, multi-dimensional rubric with near human-level agreement. To bridge the gap between frontier model reasoning and industrial-scale inference, we apply teacher-student distillation to transfer high-fidelity judgments into compact student surrogates at \\textbf{92$\\times$} lower cost. Deployed within LinkedIn Search ecosystems, SAGE guided model iteration through simulation-driven development, distilling policy-aligned models for online serving and enabling rapid offline evaluation.

However, personalizing learning activities that elicit the optimal level of cognitive engagement remains a key challenge in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). In this work, we develop and evaluate a system that adaptively scaffolds cognitive engagement by dynamically selecting worked examples in two different ICAP modes: (active) Guided examples and (constructive) Buggy examples. We compare Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) as adaptive methods against a non-adaptive baseline method for selecting example type in a logic ITS. Our experiment with 113 students demonstrates that both adaptive policies significantly improved student performance on test problems. BKT yielded the largest improvement in posttest scores for low prior knowledge students, helping them catch up with their high prior knowledge peers, whereas DRL yielded significantly higher posttest scores among high prior knowledge students.

Although Decision Transformers provide powerful sequence modeling capabilities, applying them to this constrained setting encounters two challenges: 1) standard Return-to-Go conditioning causes state aliasing by neglecting the cost dimension, preventing precise resource pacing; and 2) standard regression forces the policy to mimic average historical behaviors, thereby limiting the capacity to optimize performance toward the constraint boundary. To address these challenges, we propose PRO-Bid, a constraint-aware generative auto-bidding framework based on two synergistic mechanisms: 1) Constraint-Decoupled Pareto Representation (CDPR) decomposes global constraints into recursive cost and value contexts to restore resource perception, while reweighting trajectories based on the Pareto frontier to focus on high-efficiency data; and 2) Counterfactual Regret Optimization (CRO) facilitates active improvement by utilizing a global outcome predictor to identify superior counterfactual actions. By treating these high-utility outcomes as weighted regression targets, the model transcends historical averages to approach the optimal constraint boundary.

Recent work has improved the training stability of deep PC networks (PCNs) by leveraging some BP-inspired reparameterisations. However, the full scalability and theoretical basis of these approaches remains unclear. To address this, we study the infinite width and depth limits of PCNs. For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached. Overall, this work unifies various previous theoretical and empirical results and has potentially important implications for the scaling of PCNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PCN\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bPC\u4e0eBP\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u540c\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6539\u8fdbPCN\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684BP\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\uff0cPC\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u96c6\u4e0eBP\u76f8\u540c\uff1b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cPC\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u655b\u5230BP\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u540c\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9PCN\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In many applications, the parameters being tuned come with a carefully engineered default configuration, and practitioners only want to deviate from this default when necessary. Standard BO, however, does not aim to minimize deviation from the default and, in practice, often pushes weakly relevant parameters to the boundary of the search space. This makes it difficult to distinguish between important and spurious changes and increases the burden of vetting recommendations when the optimization objective omits relevant operational considerations. We introduce BONSAI, a default-aware BO policy that prunes low-impact deviations from a default configuration while explicitly controlling the loss in acquisition value. BONSAI is compatible with a variety of acquisition functions, including expected improvement and upper confidence bound (GP-UCB). We theoretically bound the regret incurred by BONSAI, showing that, under certain conditions, it enjoys the same no-regret property as vanilla GP-UCB. Across many real-world applications, we empirically find that BONSAI substantially reduces the number of non-default parameters in recommended configurations while maintaining competitive optimization performance, with little effect on wall time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ed8\u8ba4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565BONSAI\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u83b7\u53d6\u503c\u635f\u5931\u65f6\u4fee\u526a\u4f4e\u5f71\u54cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5e38\u5c06\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u81f3\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5ba1\u67e5\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165BONSAI\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u83b7\u53d6\u51fd\u6570\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u754c\u5b9a\u5176\u540e\u6094\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0BONSAI\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u8350\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u975e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "BONSAI\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u975e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recently, driven by the strong generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based generative recommendation has become increasingly popular. However, we observe that existing methods inevitably introduce systematic bias when estimating item-level preference distributions. Specifically, autoregressive generation suffers from incomplete coverage due to beam search pruning, while parallel generation distorts probabilities by assuming token independence. We attribute this issue to a fundamental modeling mismatch: these methods approximate item-level distributions via token-level generation, which inherently induces approximation errors. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that token-level generation cannot faithfully substitute item-level generation, leading to biased item distributions. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Sim}ply \\textbf{G}enerative \\textbf{R}ecommendation (\\textbf{SimGR}), a framework that directly models item-level preference distributions in a shared latent space and ranks items by similarity, thereby aligning the modeling objective with recommendation and mitigating distributional distortion. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLM backbones show that SimGR consistently outperforms existing generative recommenders.

In this work, we present RAPiD, a deterministic policy extraction framework that distills a pretrained diffusion-based planner into an efficient policy while eliminating diffusion sampling. Using score-regularized policy optimization, we leverage the score function of a pre-trained diffusion planner as a behavior prior to regularize policy learning. To promote safety and passenger comfort, the policy is optimized using a critic trained to imitate a predictive driver controller, providing dense, safety-focused supervision beyond conventional imitation learning. Evaluations demonstrate that RAPiD achieves competitive performance on closed-loop nuPlan scenarios with an 8x speedup over diffusion baselines, while achieving state-of-the-art generalization among learning-based planners on the interPlan benchmark.

However, individuals are inclined to defect in order to benefit from the group's cooperation without contributing the associated costs, thus leading to unfair situations. In game theory, social dilemmas entail this dichotomy between individual interest and collective outcome. The most dominant approach to multi-agent cooperation is the utilitarian welfare which can produce efficient highly inequitable outcomes. This paper proposes a novel framework to foster fairer cooperation by replacing the standard utilitarian objective with Proportional Fairness. We introduce a fair altruistic utility for each agent, defined on the individual log-payoff space and derive the analytical conditions required to ensure cooperation in classic social dilemmas. We then extend this framework to sequential settings by defining a Fair Markov Game and deriving novel fair Actor-Critic algorithms to learn fair policies.

Most papers report a pass@1 score computed from a single run per task, assuming this gives a reliable performance estimate. We test this assumption by collecting 60,000 agentic trajectories on SWE-Bench-Verified, spanning three models and two scaffolds. We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope.

Because each exploration path may modify files and spawn processes, agents require isolated environments with atomic commit and rollback semantics for both filesystem state and process state. We introduce the branch context, a new OS abstraction that provides: (1) copy-on-write state isolation with independent filesystem views and process groups, (2) a structured lifecycle of fork, explore, and commit/abort, (3) first-commit-wins resolution that automatically invalidates sibling branches, and (4) nestable contexts for hierarchical exploration. We realize branch contexts in Linux through two complementary components. First, BranchFS is a FUSE-based filesystem that gives each branch context an isolated copy-on-write workspace, with O(1) creation, atomic commit to the parent, and automatic sibling invalidation, all without root privileges. BranchFS is open sourced in https://github.com/multikernel/branchfs. Second, branch() is a proposed Linux syscall that spawns processes into branch contexts with reliable termination, kernel-enforced sibling isolation, and first-commit-wins coordination. Preliminary evaluation of BranchFS shows sub-350 us branch creation independent of base filesystem size, and modification-proportional commit overhead (under 1 ms for small changes).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8eAI\u4ee3\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5206\u652f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08branch context\uff09\u65b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5728Linux\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u521d\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u4ee3\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u9700\u8981\u6709\u539f\u5b50\u63d0\u4ea4\u548c\u56de\u6eda\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u9694\u79bb\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b64\u7c7b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u652f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5728Linux\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7BranchFS\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cbranch()\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "BranchFS\u5206\u652f\u521b\u5efa\u8017\u65f6\u5c0f\u4e8e350\u5fae\u79d2\u4e14\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u5c0f\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5c0f\u66f4\u6539\u63d0\u4ea4\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u4e8e1\u6beb\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u652f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u62bd\u8c61\u80fd\u4e3aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u9694\u79bb\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

While recent efforts have successfully enhanced these agents by scaling depth through increasing the number of sequential thinking and tool calls, the potential of scaling width via parallel tool calling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose the Wide and Deep research agent, a framework designed to investigate the behavior and performance of agents when scaling not only depth but also width via parallel tool calling. Unlike existing approaches that rely on complex multi-agent orchestration to parallelize workloads, our method leverages intrinsic parallel tool calling to facilitate effective coordination within a single reasoning step. We demonstrate that scaling width significantly improves performance on deep research benchmarks while reducing the number of turns required to obtain correct answers. Furthermore, we analyze the factors driving these improvements through case studies and explore various tool call schedulers to optimize parallel tool calling strategy. Our findings suggest that optimizing the trade-off between width and depth is a critical pathway toward high-efficiency deep research agents.

This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking.

A popular strategy is model-based policy evaluation, which estimates a model from data to infer counterfactual outcomes.

We searched the recent literature on data-driven decision-making, identifying a sample of 55 papers published in the Management Science in the past decade; all but two relied on this flawed methodology. Several common justifications are provided: (1) the estimated models are accurate, stable, and well-calibrated, (2) the historical data uses random treatment assignment, (3) the model family is well-specified, and (4) the evaluation methodology uses sample splitting. Unfortunately, we show that no combination of these justifications avoids the winner's curse. First, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that the winner's curse can cause large, spurious reported benefits even when all these justifications hold. Second, we perform a simulation study based on the recent and consequential data-driven refugee matching problem. We construct a synthetic refugee matching environment (calibrated to closely match the real setting) but designed so that no assignment policy can improve expected employment compared to random assignment. Model-based methods report large, stable gains of around 60% even when the true effect is zero; these gains are on par with improvements of 22-75% reported in the literature. Our results provide strong evidence against model-based evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u56e0\u80dc\u8005\u8bc5\u5492\u95ee\u9898\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u867d\u6709\u5e38\u89c1\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8bc1\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u7531\u65e0\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u53cd\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6240\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u671f\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u80dc\u8005\u8bc5\u5492\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u771f\u5b9e\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u641c\u7d22\u7ba1\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e7455\u7bc7\u76f8\u5173\u8bba\u6587\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u5e38\u89c1\u7406\u7531\u90fd\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u80dc\u8005\u8bc5\u5492\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u865a\u5047\u9ad8\u6536\u76ca\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u96be\u6c11\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6548\u76ca\u4e3a\u96f6\u65f6\u4ecd\u62a5\u544a\u7ea660%\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u4e0e\u6587\u732e\u4e2d22 - 75%\u7684\u6539\u5584\u5e45\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u8bc1\u636e\u53cd\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce CIRThan, a sketch+text Composed Image Retrieval dataset for Thangka imagery, a culturally grounded and knowledge-specific visual domain characterized by complex structures, dense symbolic elements, and domain-dependent semantic conventions. CIRThan contains 2,287 high-quality Thangka images, each paired with a human-drawn sketch and hierarchical textual descriptions at three semantic levels, enabling composed queries that jointly express structural intent and multi-level semantic specification. We provide standardized data splits, comprehensive dataset analysis, and benchmark evaluations of representative supervised and zero-shot CIR methods. Experimental results reveal that existing CIR approaches, largely developed for general-domain imagery, struggle to effectively align sketch-based abstractions and hierarchical textual semantics with fine-grained Thangka images, particularly without in-domain supervision.

We propose NAAMSE, an evolutionary framework that reframes agent security evaluation as a feedback-driven optimization problem. Our system employs a single autonomous agent that orchestrates a lifecycle of genetic prompt mutation, hierarchical corpus exploration, and asymmetric behavioral scoring. By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring \"benign-use correctness\", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes.

However, automated log parsing remains challenging due to heterogeneous log formats, distribution shifts between training and deployment data, and the brittleness of rule-based approaches. This study aims to systematically evaluate how sequence modelling architecture, representation choice, sequence length, and training data availability influence automated log parsing performance and computational cost. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing four sequence modelling architectures: Transformer, Mamba state-space, monodirectional LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM models. In total, 396 models are trained across multiple dataset configurations and evaluated using relative Levenshtein edit distance with statistical significance testing. Transformer achieves the lowest mean relative edit distance (0.111), followed by Mamba (0.145), mono-LSTM (0.186), and bi-LSTM (0.265), where lower values are better. Mamba provides competitive accuracy with substantially lower computational cost. Character-level tokenization generally improves performance, sequence length has negligible practical impact on Transformer accuracy, and both Mamba and Transformer demonstrate stronger sample efficiency than recurrent models. Overall, Transformers reduce parsing error by 23.4%, while Mamba is a strong alternative under data or compute constraints. These results also clarify the roles of representation choice, sequence length, and sample efficiency, providing practical guidance for researchers and practitioners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56db\u79cd\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\u3002Transformer\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u6700\u4f4e\uff0cMamba\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u56e0\u65e5\u5fd7\u683c\u5f0f\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83Transformer\u3001Mamba\u3001\u5355\u5411LSTM\u548c\u53cc\u5411LSTM\u56db\u79cd\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3396\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9Levenshtein\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "Transformer\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\u6700\u4f4e\uff0cMamba\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u5206\u8bcd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9Transformer\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff0cMamba\u548cTransformer\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformers\u964d\u4f4e\u89e3\u6790\u9519\u8bef23.4%\uff0cMamba\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u660e\u786e\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Existing robust training methods for regression NNs are often limited in scope and rely primarily on empirical validation, with only a few offering partial theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a new robust learning framework for regression NNs based on the $\u03b2$-divergence (also known as the density power divergence) which we call `rRNet'. It applies to a broad class of regression NNs, including models with non-smooth activation functions and error densities, and recovers the classical maximum likelihood learning as a special case. The rRNet is implemented via an alternating optimization scheme, for which we establish convergence guarantees to stationary points under mild, verifiable conditions. The (local) robustness of rRNet is theoretically characterized through the influence functions of both the parameter estimates and the resulting rRNet predictor, which are shown to be bounded for suitable choices of the tuning parameter $\u03b2$, depending on the error density. We further prove that rRNet attains the optimal 50\\% asymptotic breakdown point at the assumed model for all $\u03b2\\in(0, 1]$, providing a strong global robustness guarantee that is largely absent for existing NN learning methods. Our theoretical results are complemented by simulation experiments and real-data analyses, illustrating practical advantages of rRNet over existing approaches in both function approximation problems and prediction tasks with noisy observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u03b2 - \u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7a33\u5065\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6rRNet\uff0c\u6709\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56de\u5f52\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7a33\u5065\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51farRNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u523b\u753b\u5c40\u90e8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6e10\u8fd1\u5d29\u6e83\u70b9\u3002", "result": "rRNet\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523050%\u6700\u4f18\u6e10\u8fd1\u5d29\u6e83\u70b9\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "rRNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7a33\u5065\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds.

Adaptive Data Analysis (ADA) mechanisms address this challenge; however, there is a fundamental tension between computational efficiency and sample complexity. For $T$ rounds of adaptive analysis, computationally efficient algorithms typically incur suboptimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ sample complexity, whereas statistically optimal $O(\\log T)$ algorithms are computationally intractable under standard cryptographic assumptions. In this work, we shed light on this trade-off by identifying a natural class of data distributions under which both computational efficiency and optimal sample complexity are achievable. We propose a computationally efficient ADA mechanism that attains optimal $O(\\log T)$ sample complexity when the data distribution is dense with respect to a known prior. This setting includes, in particular, feature--label data distributions arising in distribution-specific learning. As a consequence, our mechanism also yields a sample-efficient (i.e., $O(\\log T)$ samples) statistical query oracle in the distribution-specific setting. Moreover, although our algorithm is not based on differential privacy, it satisfies a relaxed privacy notion known as Predicate Singling Out (PSO) security (Cohen and Nissim, 2020).

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise as automatic relevance assessors, but their reliability is still limited. Most existing approaches rely on zero-shot prompting or In-Context Learning (ICL) with a small number of labeled examples. However, standard ICL treats examples as independent instances and fails to explicitly capture the underlying relevance criteria of a topic, restricting its ability to generalize to unseen query-document pairs. To address this limitation, we introduce Relevance Context Learning (RCL), a novel framework that leverages human relevance judgements to explicitly model topic-specific relevance criteria. Rather than directly using labeled examples for in-context prediction, RCL first prompts an LLM (Instructor LLM) to analyze sets of judged query-document pairs and generate explicit narratives that describe what constitutes relevance for a given topic. These relevance narratives are then used as structured prompts to guide a second LLM (Assessor LLM) in producing relevance judgements. To evaluate RCL in a realistic data collection setting, we propose a hybrid pooling strategy in which a shallow depth-\\textit{k} pool from participating systems is judged by human assessors, while the remaining documents are labeled by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that RCL substantially outperforms zero-shot prompting and consistently improves over standard ICL. Overall, our findings indicate that transforming relevance examples into explicit, context-aware relevance narratives is a more effective way of exploiting human judgements for LLM-based IR dataset construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRelevance Context Learning (RCL)\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u6cd5\u660e\u786e\u6355\u6349\u4e3b\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RCL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u7528Instructor LLM\u5206\u6790\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u67e5\u8be2 - \u6587\u6863\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u518d\u7528Assessor LLM\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d9\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6c60\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "RCL\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u660e\u786e\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53d9\u8ff0\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Linters help developers enforce these standards by detecting code violations. However, manual linter configuration is complex and expertise-intensive, and the diversity and evolution of programming languages, coding standards, and linters lead to repetitive and maintenance-intensive configuration work. To reduce manual effort, we propose LintCFG, a domain-specific language (DSL)-driven, LLM-based compilation approach to automate linter configuration generation for coding standards, independent of programming languages, coding standards, and linters. Inspired by compiler design, we first design a DSL to express coding rules in a tool-agnostic, structured, readable, and precise manner. Then, we build linter configurations into DSL configuration instructions. For a given natural language coding standard, the compilation process parses it into DSL coding standards, matches them with the DSL configuration instructions to set configuration names, option names and values, verifies consistency between the standards and configurations, and finally generates linter-specific configurations. Experiments with Checkstyle for Java coding standard show that our approach achieves over 90% precision and recall in DSL representation, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores close to 70% (with some exceeding 70%) in fine-grained linter configuration generation.

Memory expansion via Compute Express Link (CXL) is an effective way to provide additional memory at lower cost and power, but its effective use requires software-level tiering for hyperscaler workloads. Existing tiering solutions, including current Linux support, face fundamental limitations in production deployments. First, they lack multi-tenancy support, failing to handle stacked homogeneous or heterogeneous workloads. Second, limited control-plane flexibility leads to fairness violations and performance variability. Finally, insufficient observability prevents operators from diagnosing performance pathologies at scale.\n  We present Equilibria, an OS framework enabling fair, multi-tenant CXL tiering at datacenter scale. Equilibria provides per-container controls for memory fair-share allocation and fine-grained observability of tiered-memory usage and operations. It further enforces flexible, user-specified fairness policies through regulated promotion and demotion, and mitigates noisy-neighbor interference by suppressing thrashing.\n  Evaluated in a large hyperscaler fleet using production workloads and benchmarks, Equilibria helps workloads meet service level objectives (SLOs) while avoiding performance interference.

The main idea is to classify regular languages according to their propensity to be sorted, establishing a deep connection between automata theory and data compression [J. ACM 2023]. This parameterization leads to two hierarchies of regular languages: a deterministic hierarchy and a non-deterministic hierarchy. While the deterministic hierarchy is well understood, the non-deterministic hierarchy appears much more complex. This is true even for the richest and most studied level of the hierarchies, corresponding to the class of Wheeler languages.\n  In this paper, we study Wheeler language through the lens of bisimulations. We first show that the standard notion of bisimulation is not appropriate. Then, we introduce Wheeler bisimulations, that is, bisimulations that respect the convex structure of the considered Wheeler automata. Although there are some differences between the properties of bisimulations and the properties of Wheeler bisimulations, we show that Wheeler bisimulations induce a unique minimal Wheeler NFA (analogously to standard bisimulations). In particular, in the deterministic case, we retrieve the minimum Wheeler deterministic automaton of a given language. We also show that the minimal Wheeler NFA induced by Wheeler bisimulations can be built in linear time. This is in contrast with standard bisimulations, for which the corresponding minimal NFA can be built in $ O(m \\log n) $ time (where $ m $ is the number of edges and $ n $ is the number of states) by adapting Paige-Tarjan's partition refinement algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76Wheeler\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Wheeler\u53cc\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u552f\u4e00\u6700\u5c0fWheeler NFA\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fWheeler\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u6307\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u53cc\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Wheeler\u53cc\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "Wheeler\u53cc\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u552f\u4e00\u6700\u5c0fWheeler NFA\uff0c\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u5c0fWheeler\u786e\u5b9a\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u53cc\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "conclusion": "Wheeler\u53cc\u6a21\u62df\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76Wheeler\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Despite the progress, existing approaches typically rely on static, decoupled tokenization that ignores collaborative signals. While recent methods attempt to integrate collaborative signals into item identifiers either during index construction or through end-to-end modeling, they encounter significant challenges in real-world production environments. Specifically, the volatility of collaborative signals leads to unstable tokenization, and current end-to-end strategies often devolve into suboptimal two-stage training rather than achieving true co-evolution. To bridge this gap, we propose PIT, a dynamic Personalized Item Tokenizer framework for end-to-end generative recommendation, which employs a co-generative architecture that harmonizes collaborative patterns through collaborative signal alignment and synchronizes item tokenizer with generative recommender via a co-evolution learning. This enables the dynamic, joint, end-to-end evolution of both index construction and recommendation. Furthermore, a one-to-many beam index ensures scalability and robustness, facilitating seamless integration into large-scale industrial deployments. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PIT consistently outperforms competitive baselines.

Moreover, recent works have primarily focused on genetic perturbations in single-cell experiments, leaving bulk-cell chemical perturbations, which is central to drug discovery, largely unexplored. Motivated by this, we present LINCSQA, a novel benchmark for predicting target gene regulation under complex chemical perturbations in bulk-cell environments. We further propose PBio-Agent, a multi-agent framework that integrates difficulty-aware task sequencing with iterative knowledge refinement. Our key insight is that genes affected by the same perturbation share causal structure, allowing confidently predicted genes to contextualize more challenging cases. The framework employs specialized agents enriched with biological knowledge graphs, while a synthesis agent integrates outputs and specialized judges ensure logical coherence. PBio-Agent outperforms existing baselines on both LINCSQA and PerturbQA, enabling even smaller models to predict and explain complex biological processes without additional training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLINCSQA\u57fa\u51c6\u53caPBio - Agent\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec6\u80de\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u5316\u5b66\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u9776\u57fa\u56e0\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6270\u52a8\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec6\u80de\u5316\u5b66\u6270\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLINCSQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPBio - Agent\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5bcc\u96c6\u751f\u7269\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u7efc\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u3002", "result": "PBio - Agent\u5728LINCSQA\u548cPerturbQA\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "PBio - Agent\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec6\u80de\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u5316\u5b66\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u9776\u57fa\u56e0\u8c03\u63a7\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The goal is to produce a finite-sample confidence set for the index at which the change occurs without making any other assumptions. Existing methods often rely on parametric assumptions, tail conditions, or asymptotic approximations, or only produce point estimates. In contrast, our distribution-free algorithm, CONformal CHangepoint localization (CONCH), only leverages exchangeability arguments to construct confidence sets with finite sample coverage. By proving a conformal Neyman-Pearson lemma, we derive principled score functions that yield informative (small) sets. Moreover, with such score functions, the normalized length of the confidence set shrinks to zero under weak assumptions.

By comparison, all known constructions of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile require working over alphabets whose size grows at least exponentially with the number of output symbols per time instant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u683c\u72b6\u7801\u81ea\u7531\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5217\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684Singleton\u578b\u754c\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u6a21\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u8ddd\u79bb\u8c31\u5377\u79ef\u7801\u7684\u683c\u72b6\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u683c\u72b6\u7801\u4e0e\u5377\u79ef\u7801\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7279\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u6784\u9020\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u7684\u683c\u72b6\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u754c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u6765\u6784\u9020\u683c\u72b6\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u5b9a\u65f6\u523b\u683c\u72b6\u7801\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u5217\u8ddd\u79bb\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u5377\u79ef\u7801\uff1b\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u6a21\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u8ddd\u79bb\u8c31\u5377\u79ef\u7801\u901f\u7387 - \u8ddd\u79bb\u6743\u8861\u7684\u683c\u72b6\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u683c\u72b6\u7801\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6709\u8d85\u8fc7\u5377\u79ef\u7801\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u6a21\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u6784\u9020\u63a5\u8fd1\u5377\u79ef\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7801\u3002"}}

Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications.

In this paper, we argue that environment setup success should be evaluated through executable evidence rather than a single binary signal. We introduce the Environment Maturity Hierarchy, which defines three success levels based on progressively stronger execution requirements, culminating in successful execution of a project's main entry point.

By examining shoe prints, investigators can determine details of the footwear worn by suspects. However, establishing that a suspect's shoes match the make and model of a crime scene print may not be sufficient. Typically, thousands of shoes of the same size, make, and model are manufactured, any of which could be responsible for the print. Accordingly, a popular approach used by investigators is to examine the print for signs of ``accidentals,'' i.e., cuts, scrapes, and other features that accumulate on shoe soles after purchase due to wear. While some patterns of accidentals are common on certain types of shoes, others are highly distinctive, potentially distinguishing the suspect's shoe from all others. Quantifying the rarity of a pattern is thus essential to accurately measuring the strength of forensic evidence. In this study, we address this task by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our improvement over existing methods primarily stems from two advancements. First, we frame our approach in terms of a latent Gaussian model, thus enabling inference to be efficiently scaled to large collections of annotated shoe prints via integrated nested Laplace approximations. Second, we incorporate spatially varying coefficients to model the relationship between shoes' tread patterns and accidental locations.

A direct corollary of our result is an efficient online algorithm for minimizing the calibration error for general elicitable properties. This result does not require the Lipschitzness assumption of the identification function needed in prior work, making it applicable to median calibration, for which we achieve the first $\\widetilde O(\\sqrt T)$ calibration error guarantee.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Exploiting an architectural feature of the OpenClaw agent framework--a periodic \"heartbeat\" cycle that produces regular posting intervals for autonomous agents but is disrupted by human prompting--we develop a temporal fingerprinting method based on the coefficient of variation of inter-post intervals. This signal converges with independent content, ownership, and network indicators across 91,792 posts and 405,707 comments from 22,020 agents. No viral phenomenon originated from a clearly autonomous agent; three of six traced to accounts with irregular temporal signatures characteristic of human intervention, one showed mixed patterns, and two had insufficient posting history for classification. A 44-hour platform shutdown provided a natural experiment: human-influenced agents returned first (87.7% of early reconnectors), confirming that the token reset differentially affected autonomous versus human-operated agents. We further document industrial-scale bot farming (four accounts producing 32% of all comments with 12-second coordination gaps) and rapid decay of human influence through reply chains (half-life: 0.65 conversation depths).

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) on code understanding and generation tasks, an important yet underexplored question arises: do these traditional complexity metrics meaningfully characterize the difficulty LLMs experience when processing code? In this work, we empirically demonstrate that, after controlling for code length, classical metrics exhibit no consistent correlation with LLM performance, revealing a fundamental mismatch with model-perceived difficulty. To address this gap, we propose LM-CC, a novel code complexity metric designed from the perspective of LLMs. The core premise of LM-CC is that LLM-perceived difficulty is driven by the nonlinearity of program semantics. Accordingly, we decompose programs into semantic units based on entropy, organize these units into a compositional hierarchy, and quantify complexity as a principled aggregation of compositional level and branching-induced divergence, capturing cumulative model uncertainty during code processing. Our extensive experiments show that LM-CC not only correlates more strongly with LLM performance than traditional metrics but also that lowering it directly enhances task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6307\u6807LM - CC\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u523b\u753b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u65f6\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6309\u71b5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "LM - CC\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u65b0\u6307\u6807LM - CC\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Despite its potential, current approaches typically rely on the next-token prediction schema, which treats each token of the next interacted items as the sole target. This narrow focus 1) limits their ability to capture the nuanced structure of user preferences, and 2) overlooks the deep interaction between decoded identifiers and user behavior sequences. In response to these challenges, we propose RankGR, a Rank-enhanced Generative Retrieval method that incorporates listwise direct preference optimization for recommendation. RankGR decomposes the retrieval process into two complementary stages: the Initial Assessment Phase (IAP) and the Refined Scoring Phase (RSP). In IAP, we incorporate a novel listwise direct preference optimization strategy into GR, thus facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the hierarchical user preferences and more effective partial-order modeling. The RSP then refines the top-\u03bb candidates generated by IAP with interactions towards input sequences using a lightweight scoring module, leading to more precise candidate evaluation.

But how robust are these reasoning traces to disruptions that occur within them? To address this question, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that perturbs a model's own CoT at fixed timesteps. We design seven interventions (benign, neutral, and adversarial) and apply them to multiple open-weight RLLMs across Math, Science, and Logic tasks. Our results show that RLLMs are generally robust, reliably recovering from diverse perturbations, with robustness improving with model size and degrading when interventions occur early. However, robustness is not style-invariant: paraphrasing suppresses doubt-like expressions and reduces performance, while other interventions trigger doubt and support recovery. Recovery also carries a cost: neutral and adversarial noise can inflate CoT length by more than 200%, whereas paraphrasing shortens traces but harms accuracy. These findings provide new evidence on how RLLMs maintain reasoning integrity, identify doubt as a central recovery mechanism, and highlight trade-offs between robustness and efficiency that future training methods should address.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u822c\u8f83\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u6062\u590d\u6709\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u53d7\u5230\u5e72\u6270\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u6270\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e03\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u5f0f\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8de8\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u8f83\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u6270\u52a8\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e72\u9884\u8fc7\u65e9\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u975e\u98ce\u683c\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u91ca\u4e49\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u5e72\u9884\u89e6\u53d1\u6000\u7591\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u6062\u590d\uff1b\u6062\u590d\u6709\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u4e2d\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u4f7f\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u8d85200%\uff0c\u91ca\u4e49\u7f29\u77ed\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4f46\u635f\u5bb3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7ef4\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6000\u7591\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u672a\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

A particularly elegant way of interpreting SCMs is do-Shapley, a game-theoretic method of quantifying the average effect of $d$ variables across exponentially many interventions. Like Shapley values, computing do-Shapley values generally requires evaluating exponentially many terms. The foundation of our work is a reformulation of do-Shapley values in terms of the irreducible sets of the underlying SCM. Leveraging this insight, we can exactly compute do-Shapley values in time linear in the number of irreducible sets $r$, which itself can range from $d$ to $2^d$ depending on the graph structure of the SCM. Since $r$ is unknown a priori, we complement the exact algorithm with an estimator that, like general Shapley value estimators, can be run with any query budget. As the query budget approaches $r$, our estimators can produce more accurate estimates than prior methods by several orders of magnitude, and, when the budget reaches $r$, return the Shapley values up to machine precision. Beyond computational speed, we also reduce the identification burden: we prove that non-parametric identifiability of do-Shapley values requires only the identification of interventional effects for the $d$ singleton coalitions, rather than all classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97do - Shapley\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8bc6\u522b\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97do - Shapley\u503c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u9879\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "\u5c06do - Shapley\u503c\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840SCM\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u914d\u5408\u6709\u4efb\u610f\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u96c6\u6570\u91cf\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u96c6\u6570\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u65f6\u53ef\u8fd4\u56de\u63a5\u8fd1\u673a\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684Shapley\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86do - Shapley\u503c\u7684\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

However, the inherent complexity of live-streaming prevents the direct transfer of these methods to live-streaming scenario, where continuously evolving content, limited lifecycles, strict real-time constraints, and heterogeneous multi-objectives introduce unique challenges that invalidate static tokenization and conventional model framework.

However, many verification and synthesis problems for POMDPs are undecidable or intractable. Most prominently, the seminal result of Madani et al. (2003) states that there is no algorithm that, given a POMDP and a set of target states, can compute the maximal probability of reaching the target states, or even approximate it up to a non-trivial constant. This is in stark contrast to fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the reachability value can be computed in polynomial time.\n  In this work, we introduce posterior-deterministic POMDPs, a novel class of POMDPs. Our main technical contribution is to show that for posterior-deterministic POMDPs, the maximal probability of reaching a given set of states can be approximated up to arbitrary precision.\n  A POMDP is posterior-deterministic if the next state can be uniquely determined by the current state, the action taken, and the observation received. While the actual state is generally uncertain in POMDPs, the posterior-deterministic property tells us that once the true state is known it remains known forever. This simple and natural definition includes all MDPs and captures classical non-trivial examples such as the Tiger POMDP (Kaelbling et al. 1998), making it one of the largest known classes of POMDPs for which the reachability value can be approximated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027POMDPs\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6b64\u7c7bPOMDPs\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u4efb\u610f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591aPOMDPs\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\u6216\u96be\u89e3\uff0c\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6982\u7387\u65e0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027POMDPs\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u578bPOMDPs\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u8be5\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u4e0b\u4e00\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u7531\u5f53\u524d\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027POMDPs\uff0c\u5230\u8fbe\u7ed9\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u4efb\u610f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027POMDPs\u5b9a\u4e49\u7b80\u5355\u81ea\u7136\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6240\u6709MDPs\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u662f\u5df2\u77e5\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u503c\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u6700\u5927POMDPs\u7c7b\u522b\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002"}}

In these workflows, agents often write tests on the fly, a paradigm adopted by many high-ranking agents on the SWE-bench leaderboard. However, we observe that GPT-5.2, which writes almost no new tests, can even achieve performance comparable to top-ranking agents. This raises the critical question: whether such tests meaningfully improve issue resolution or merely mimic human testing practices while consuming a substantial interaction budget.\n  To reveal the impact of agent-written tests, we present an empirical study that analyzes agent trajectories across six state-of-the-art LLMs on SWE-bench Verified. Our results show that while test writing is commonly adopted, but resolved and unresolved tasks within the same model exhibit similar test-writing frequencies Furthermore, these tests typically serve as observational feedback channels, where agents prefer value-revealing print statements significantly more than formal assertion-based checks. Based on these insights, we perform a controlled experiment by revising the prompts of four agents to either increase or reduce test writing. The results suggest that changes in the volume of agent-written tests do not significantly change final outcomes.

Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility.

As these skills proliferate in public marketplaces, it is unclear what types are available, how users adopt them, and what risks they pose. To answer these questions, we conduct a large-scale, data-driven analysis of 40,285 publicly listed skills from a major marketplace. Our results show that skill publication tends to occur in short bursts that track shifts in community attention. We also find that skill content is highly concentrated in software engineering workflows, while information retrieval and content creation account for a substantial share of adoption. Beyond content trends, we uncover a pronounced supply-demand imbalance across categories, and we show that most skills remain within typical prompt budgets despite a heavy-tailed length distribution. Finally, we observe strong ecosystem homogeneity, with widespread intent-level redundancy, and we identify non-trivial safety risks, including skills that enable state-changing or system-level actions.

Yet in implicit-feedback, a single global temperature and equal treatment of uniformly sampled negatives can lead to brittle training, because sampled sets may contain varying degrees of relevant or informative competitors. The optimal loss sharpness for a user-item pair with a particular set of negatives, can be suboptimal or destabilising for another with different negatives. We introduce Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL), which infers effective sharpness from the sampled competition itself. DSL adds two complementary branches to the log-sum-exp backbone. Firstly it reweights negatives within each training instance using hardness and item--item similarity, secondly it adapts a per-example temperature from the competition intensity over a constructed competitor slate. Together, these components preserve the geometry of SL while reshaping the competition distribution across negatives and across examples.\n  Over several representative benchmarks and backbones, DSL yields substantial gains over strong baselines, with improvements over SL exceeding $10%$ in several settings and averaging $6.22%$ across datasets, metrics, and backbones. Under out-of-distribution (OOD) popularity shift, the gains are larger, with an average of $9.31%$ improvement over SL. We further provide a theoretical, distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) analysis, which demonstrates how DSL reshapes the robust payoff and the KL deviation for ambiguous instances.

In real-world applications, these models require periodic updates to adapt to new interactions and evolving user preferences. While incremental learning methods facilitate these updates, they face significant challenges. Replay-based approaches incur high memory and computational costs, and regularization-based methods often struggle to discard outdated or conflicting knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose SA-CAISR, a Stage-Adaptive and Conflict-Aware Incremental Sequential Recommendation framework. As a buffer-free framework, SA-CAISR operates using only the old model and new data, directly addressing the high costs of replay-based techniques. SA-CAISR introduces a novel Fisher-weighted knowledge-screening mechanism that dynamically identifies outdated knowledge by estimating parameter-level conflicts between the old model and new data, allowing our approach to selectively remove obsolete knowledge while preserving compatible historical patterns. This dynamic balance between stability and adaptability allows our method to achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in incremental SR. Specifically, SA-CAISR improves Recall@20 by 2.0%, MRR@20 by 1.2%, and NDCG@20 by 1.4% on average across datasets, while reducing memory usage by 97.5% and training time by 46.9% compared to the best baselines.

For complex tasks such as image editing, reward models are required to capture global semantic consistency and implicit logical constraints beyond local similarity. Existing reward modeling approaches have clear limitations. Discriminative reward models align well with human preferences but struggle with complex semantics due to limited reasoning supervision. Generative reward models offer stronger semantic understanding and reasoning, but they are costly at inference time and difficult to align directly with human preferences. To this end, we propose Joint Reward Modeling (JRM), which jointly optimizes preference learning and language modeling on a shared vision-language backbone.

EBSE aims to inform industrial practice with the best evidence from rigorous research, preferably from systematic literature reviews (SLRs). Since then, SE researchers have conducted many SLRs, perfected their SLR procedures, proposed alternative ways of presenting their results (such as Evidence Briefings), and profusely discussed how to conduct research that impacts practice. Nevertheless, there is still a feeling that SLRs' results are not reaching practitioners. Something is missing. In this vision paper, we introduce Evidence to Decision (EtD) frameworks from the health sciences, which propose gathering experts in panels to assess the existing best evidence about the impact of an intervention in all relevant outcomes and make structured recommendations based on them. The insight we can leverage from EtD frameworks is not their structure per se but all the relevant criteria for making recommendations to practitioners from SLRs. Furthermore, we provide a worked example based on an SE SLR. We also discuss the challenges the SE research and practice community may face when adopting EtD frameworks, highlighting the need for more comprehensive criteria in our recommendations to industry practitioners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f15\u5165\u5065\u5eb7\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684EtD\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0bSLR\u7ed3\u679c\u96be\u8fbe\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u793a\u4f8b\u548c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u867d\u5f00\u5c55\u8bf8\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff08SLR\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u96be\u8fbe\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\uff0c\u6545\u5bfb\u6c42\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5065\u5eb7\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684Evidence to Decision (EtD)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0bSLR\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86EtD\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u793e\u533a\u91c7\u7528EtD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u9700\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

This work explores a fundamental principle for enhancing generative models: treating retrieval as a form of dynamic in-context learning. We test an adaptive retrieval-augmented architecture where an LLM agent actively decides when to query an external knowledge base during its reasoning process. We compare this adaptive strategy against a standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline and a static retrieval approach on the GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks. Although our experiments show that static retrieval is inferior to CoT, the adaptive retrieval shows interesting behavior: While traces including retrieved results show slightly worse performance compared to CoT, traces that do not include retrieval actually perform better compared to CoT. This suggests that: (a) retrieval only rarely helps reasoning (we show a few counterexamples, e.g. using useful theorems) and (b) actively not using retrieval is indicative of good model performance. Furthermore, we find that the model scales its retrieval frequency with the difficulty of the problem, reinforcing that the decision to retrieve is a crucial metacognitive signal.

Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMSP - LLM\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6750\u6599\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6750\u6599\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u662fAI\u9a71\u52a8\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e14\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7f3a\u5c11\u89e3\u51b3\u6574\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684MSP - LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u524d\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\uff08PP\uff09\u548c\u5408\u6210\u64cd\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff08SOP\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u6563\u6750\u6599\u7c7b\u522b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u524d\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "MSP - LLM\u5728PP\u3001SOP\u548c\u5b8c\u6574MSP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MSP - LLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684MSP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

In the survey of 80 customers and interviews with 6 of them, we also investigated the effect of software development methodology on the same outcomes. The results show that nearshore development is advantageous for overall success, quality, reduced PM effort, maintaining schedule, higher quality, and engendering fewer communication problems.

We ask whether, beyond producing good tours, a trained TSP solver learns internal representations that transfer to other optimization-relevant objectives, in the spirit of transfer learning from other domains. We train several attention-based TSP policies, collect their internal activations, and train probes on node/edge embeddings for two NP-hard prescriptive downstream tasks inspired by real-world logistics scenarios: node-removal sensitivity (identifying the most impactful node to remove) and edge-forbid sensitivity (identifying the most critical edge to retain). On a Euclidean TSP100-trained model, probes for both tasks are competitive with existing baselines. Ensembling probe signals with geometric features outperforms the strongest baselines: 65\\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 58\\% baseline) for the best-node-removal task, and 73\\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 67\\% baseline) for the worst-edge identification task. To our knowledge, we are the first to study neural TSP solvers as transferable encoders for prescriptive what-if decision-support objectives beyond tour construction. Finally, we show that transfer accuracy increases with solver quality across training and model scale, suggesting that training stronger NCO solvers also yields more useful encoders for downstream objectives.

We introduce LLMScholarBench, a benchmark for auditing LLM-based scholar recommendation that jointly evaluates model infrastructure and end-user interventions across multiple tasks. LLMScholarBench measures both technical quality and social representation using nine metrics. We instantiate the benchmark in physics expert recommendation and audit 22 LLMs under temperature variation, representation-constrained prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via web search. Our results show that end-user interventions do not yield uniform improvements but instead redistribute error across dimensions. Higher temperature degrades validity, consistency, and factuality. Representation-constrained prompting improves diversity at the expense of factuality, while RAG primarily improves technical quality while reducing diversity and parity.

To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u8bca\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528LiveLedger\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u72b6\u6001\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8de8\u6240\u6709\u8981\u6c42\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Epistemic Ledger\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u8bca\u65ad\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7528LiveLedger\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1bLiveLedger\u51cf\u5c11\u672a\u5145\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b54\u6848\uff08\u6700\u591a26.5%\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u6700\u591a11.6%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u3002"}}

Automated documentation generation has evolved from heuristic and rule-based methods to neural network-based and large language model (LLM)-based approaches. However, existing methods often overlook structural and quantitative characteristics of code that influence readability and comprehension. Prior research suggests that code metrics capture information relevant to program understanding. Building on these insights, this paper investigates the role of source code metrics as auxiliary signals for automated documentation generation, focusing on computational notebooks, a popular medium among data scientists that integrates code, narrative, and results but suffers from inconsistent documentation. We propose a two-stage approach. First, the CodeSearchNet dataset construction process was refined to create a specialized dataset from over 17 million code and markdown cells. After structural and semantic filtering, approximately 36,734 high-quality (code, markdown) pairs were extracted. Second, two modeling paradigms, a lightweight CNN-RNN architecture and a few-shot GPT-3.5 architecture, were evaluated with and without metric information. Results show that incorporating code metrics improves the accuracy and contextual relevance of generated documentation, yielding gains of 6% in BLEU-1 and 3% in ROUGE-L F1 for CNN-RNN-based architecture, and 9% in BERTScore F1 for LLM-based architecture.

In particular, a concept of feature unlearning, in which a neural network progressively loses previously learned features over long training, has gained attention. In this study, we consider the infinite-width limit of a two-layer neural network updated with a large-batch stochastic gradient, then derive differential equations with different time scales, revealing the mechanism and conditions for feature unlearning to occur. Specifically, we utilize the fast-slow dynamics: while an alignment of first-layer weights develops rapidly, the second-layer weights develop slowly. The direction of a flow on a critical manifold, determined by the slow dynamics, decides whether feature unlearning occurs. We give numerical validation of the result, and derive theoretical grounding and scaling laws of the feature unlearning. Our results yield the following insights: (i) the strength of the primary nonlinear term in data induces the feature unlearning, and (ii) an initial scale of the second-layer weights mitigates the feature unlearning.

We introduce Verify-RL, a framework where every parent-child decomposition satisfies three verifiable conditions: strictly decreasing structural complexity, solution containment, and formal rule derivation. Unlike heuristic methods where a significant fraction of decompositions are invalid our properties admit automatic verification through symbolic computation, achieving \"verification by construction\" Experiments demonstrate that eliminating invalid decompositions yields sizable gains, accuracy on the hardest problems more than doubles from 32% to 68%, with a 40% relative improvement overall.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165Verify - RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6d88\u9664\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u89e3\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7236\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u5173\u7cfb\u6709\u6570\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Verify - RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7236\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u964d\u4f4e\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u89e3\u5305\u542b\u6027\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba1\u7b97\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6d88\u9664\u65e0\u6548\u5206\u89e3\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u6700\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece32%\u63d0\u5347\u523068%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534740%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u7528\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Over the years, various automated tools have been developed to aid in this process. Search-based approaches typically achieve high coverage but produce tests with low readability, whereas large language model (LLM)-based methods generate more human-readable tests but often suffer from low coverage and compilability. While the majority of research efforts have focused on improving test coverage and readability, little attention has been paid to enhancing the robustness of bug detection, particularly in exposing corner cases and vulnerable execution paths. To address this gap, we propose AdverTest, a novel adversarial framework for LLM-powered test case generation. AdverTest comprises two interacting agents: a test case generation agent (T) and a mutant generation agent (M). These agents engage in an adversarial loop, where M persistently creates new mutants \"hacking\" the blind spots of T's current test suite, while T iteratively refines its test cases to \"kill\" the challenging mutants produced by M. This interaction loop is guided by both coverage and mutation scores, enabling the system to co-evolve toward both high test coverage and bug detection capability.

While optimal algorithms are known for each measure individually, there is no known algorithm achieving optimal bounds for both simultaneously. Marinov and Zimmert [2021] first showed that such simultaneous optimality is impossible against an adaptive adversary. Our work takes a first step to demonstrate its possibility against an oblivious adversary when losses are deterministic. First, we extend the impossibility result of Marinov and Zimmert [2021] to the case of deterministic losses. Then, we present an algorithm achieving optimal static and dynamic regret simultaneously against an oblivious adversary. Together, they reveal a fundamental separation between adaptive and oblivious adversaries when multiple regret benchmarks are considered simultaneously. It also provides new insight into the long open problem of simultaneously achieving optimal regret against switching benchmarks of different numbers of switches.\n  Our algorithm uses negative static regret to compensate for the exploration overhead incurred when controlling dynamic regret, and leverages Blackwell approachability to jointly control both regrets.

Current personalized multimodal models are predominantly static-concepts are fixed at initialization and cannot evolve during interactions. We propose M2A, an agentic dual-layer hybrid memory system that maintains personalized multimodal information through online updates. The system employs two collaborative agents: ChatAgent manages user interactions and autonomously decides when to query or update memory, while MemoryManager breaks down memory requests from ChatAgent into detailed operations on the dual-layer memory bank, which couples a RawMessageStore (immutable conversation log) with a SemanticMemoryStore (high-level observations), providing memories at different granularities. In addition, we develop a reusable data synthesis pipeline that injects concept-grounded sessions from Yo'LLaVA and MC-LLaVA into LoCoMo long conversations while preserving temporal coherence. Experiments show that M2A significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating that transforming personalization from one-shot configuration to a co-evolving memory mechanism provides a viable path for high-quality individualized responses in long-term multimodal interactions.

However, it is severely bottlenecked by the increasing memory demands of its KV cache. Previous works have shown that self-speculative decoding with sparse attention, where tokens are drafted using a subset of the KV cache and verified in parallel with full KV cache, speeds up inference in a lossless way. However, this approach relies on standalone KV selection algorithms to select the KV entries used for drafting and overlooks that the criticality of each KV entry is inherently computed during verification. In this paper, we propose SpecAttn, a self-speculative decoding method with verification-guided sparse attention. SpecAttn identifies critical KV entries as a byproduct of verification and only loads these entries when drafting subsequent tokens. This not only improves draft token acceptance rate but also incurs low KV selection overhead, thereby improving decoding throughput.

We study the feature sensitivity problem, which asks whether an ensemble is sensitive to a specified subset of features -- such as protected attributes -- whose manipulation can alter model predictions. Existing approaches often yield examples of sensitivity that lie far from the training distribution, limiting their interpretability and practical value. We propose a data-aware sensitivity framework that constrains the sensitive examples to remain close to the dataset, thereby producing realistic and interpretable evidence of model weaknesses. To this end, we develop novel techniques for data-aware search using a combination of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) encodings. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we strengthen the NP-hardness result for sensitivity verification, showing it holds even for trees of depth 1. Second, we develop MILP-optimizations that significantly speed up sensitivity verification for single ensembles and for the first time can also handle multiclass tree ensembles. Third, we introduce a data-aware framework generating realistic examples close to the training distribution.

To address this, we introduce SleepMaMi , a Sleep Foundation Model engineered to master both hour-long sleep architectures and fine-grained signal morphologies.

Macro-Encoder is trained via Demographic-Guided Contrastive Learning, which aligns overnight sleep patterns with objective subject metadata, such as age, sex and BMI to refine global representations. Micro-Encoder is optimized via a hybrid Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and multi-modal contrastive objective.

It is crucial that developers understand the architecture and how changes to a service affect the overall system, but rapid and independent development of services increases the risk of architectural drift and discourages the creation and maintenance of documentation. Automatic architecture reconstruction can help avoid these issues, but it is difficult to reuse reconstruction code across multiple projects, as all use different combinations of technologies and project-specific conventions. Reconstruction of architecture-level details is further complicated by the tendency to split microservices into separate repositories, preventing a full view of the system from any one codebase. In this paper, we present and evaluate ModARO, an approach to microservice architecture reconstruction that allows writing modular reconstruction code ('extractors') for any technologies and reusing them across different projects, independent of the surrounding technology stack or whether or not the services are split into multiple codebases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by configuring ModARO to reconstruct 10 open source projects, and we validate the usefulness and usability of ModARO against a state-of-the-art baseline in a user study with 8 industry practitioners.

However, the dynamic nature of emerging AI applications, the continual introduction of new datasets, and the growing number of models claiming superior performance make efficient and reliable validation of model services increasingly challenging. This motivates the development of sample-efficient performance estimators, which aim to estimate model performance by strategically selecting instances for labeling, thereby reducing annotation cost. Yet existing evaluation approaches often fail in low-variance settings: RMSE conflates bias and variance, masking persistent bias when variance is small, while p-value based tests become hypersensitive, rejecting adequate estimators for negligible deviations. To address this, we propose a fault-tolerant evaluation framework that integrates bias and variance considerations within an adjustable tolerance level ${\\varepsilon}$, enabling the evaluation of performance estimators within practically acceptable error margins. We theoretically show that proper calibration of ${\\varepsilon}$ ensures reliable evaluation across different variance regimes, and we further propose an algorithm that automatically optimizes and selects ${\\varepsilon}$. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework provides comprehensive and actionable insights into estimator behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This is particularly harmful in modern applications such as learning-enhanced platform operations and post-bandit statistical inference. Thus motivated, we introduce a new performance metric of MAB algorithms termed allocation variability, which is the largest (over arms) standard deviation of an arm's number of pulls. We establish a fundamental trade-off between allocation variability and regret, the canonical performance metric of reward maximization. In particular, for any algorithm, the worst-case regret $R_T$ and worst-case allocation variability $S_T$ must satisfy $R_T \\cdot S_T=\u03a9(T^{\\frac{3}{2}})$ as $T\\rightarrow\\infty$, as long as $R_T=o(T)$. This indicates that any minimax regret-optimal algorithm must incur worst-case allocation variability $\u0398(T)$, the largest possible scale; while any algorithm with sublinear worst-case regret must necessarily incur ${S}_T= \u03c9(\\sqrt{T})$.

Despite recent progress in retrieval-augmented and graph-based QA methods, systematic evaluation in this setting remains limited, especially for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese, due to the lack of benchmark datasets that explicitly support multihop reasoning over healthcare regulations. In this work, we introduce the Vietnamese Healthcare Regulations-Multihop Reasoning Dataset (ViHERMES), a benchmark designed for multihop QA over Vietnamese healthcare regulatory documents. ViHERMES consists of high-quality question-answer pairs that require reasoning across multiple regulations and capture diverse dependency patterns, including amendment tracing, cross-document comparison, and procedural synthesis. To construct the dataset, we propose a controlled multihop QA generation pipeline based on semantic clustering and graph-inspired data mining, followed by large language model-based generation with structured evidence and reasoning annotations. We further present a graph-aware retrieval framework that models formal legal relations at the level of legal units and supports principled context expansion for legally valid and coherent answers. Experimental results demonstrate that ViHERMES provides a challenging benchmark for evaluating multihop regulatory QA systems and that the proposed graph-aware approach consistently outperforms strong retrieval-based baselines.

These visual representations pose unique challenges for machine understanding, as they combine both structural and visual complexities. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results in table understanding, they typically assume the relevant table is readily available. However, a more practical scenario involves identifying and reasoning over relevant tables from large-scale collections to answer user queries. To address this gap, we propose TabRAG, a framework that enables MLLMs to answer queries over large collections of table images. Our approach first retrieves candidate tables using jointly trained visual-text foundation models, then leverages MLLMs to perform fine-grained reranking of these candidates, and finally employs MLLMs to reason over the selected tables for answer generation. Through extensive experiments on a newly constructed dataset comprising 88,161 training and 9,819 testing samples across 8 benchmarks with 48,504 unique tables, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods by 7.0% in retrieval recall and 6.1% in answer accuracy, offering a practical solution for real-world table understanding tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTabRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9MLLMs\u5728\u5927\u96c6\u5408\u8868\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u56de\u7b54\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5047\u8bbe\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u683c\u553e\u624b\u53ef\u5f97\uff0c\u66f4\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u662f\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u683c\u56de\u7b54\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6b64\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u7f3a\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5229\u7528\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9 - \u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u5019\u9009\u8868\uff0c\u518d\u7528MLLMs\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u8868\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528MLLMs\u5bf9\u9009\u5b9a\u8868\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u68c0\u7d22\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd57.0%\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d856.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TabRAG\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created new opportunities to support knowledge-intensive Scrum practices.

In this study, we investigate the use of LLMs in Scrum management activities through a survey of 70 Brazilian professionals. Among them, 49 actively use Scrum, and 33 reported using LLM-based assistants in their Scrum practices. The results indicate a high level of proficiency and frequent use of LLMs, with 85% of respondents reporting intermediate or advanced proficiency and 52% using them daily. LLM use concentrates on exploring Scrum practices, with artifacts and events receiving targeted yet uneven support, whereas broader management tasks appear to be adopted more cautiously. The main benefits include increased productivity (78%) and reduced manual effort (75%). However, several critical risks remain, as respondents report 'almost correct' outputs (81%), confidentiality concerns (63%), and hallucinations during use (59%).

The framework instantiates core cerebellar principles, including high-dimensional pattern separation via fixed feature expansion, parallel microzone-style residual pathways, and local error-driven plasticity with excitatory and inhibitory eligibility traces operating at distinct time scales. These mechanisms enable fast, localized correction under post-training disturbances while avoiding destabilizing global policy updates.

In this paper, we propose a role-aware, phase-wise diagnostic framework that traces how these risks emerge, manifest in ranking outcomes, and accumulate over repeated recommendation cycles. We formalize a controlled feedback-loop pipeline that simulates long-term interaction dynamics and enables empirical measurement of risks at the LLM-generated content, ranking, and ecosystem levels. Experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that LLM-based components can amplify popularity bias, introduce spurious signals through hallucination, and lead to polarized and self-reinforcing exposure patterns over time.

Some examples are advances in artificial intelligence that make machines more and more humanlike, and the introduction of decentralized technologies (e.g. blockchains), which creates new forms of (decentralized) trust. These new developments have the potential to improve the provision of products and services, as well as to contribute to individual and collective well-being. However, their adoption depends largely on trust. In order to build trustworthy systems, along with defining laws, regulations and proper governance models for new forms of trust, it is necessary to properly conceptualize trust, so that it can be understood both by humans and machines. This paper is the culmination of a long-term research program of providing a solid ontological foundation on trust, by creating reference conceptual models to support information modeling, automated reasoning, information integration and semantic interoperability tasks. To address this, a Reference Ontology of Trust (ONTrust) was developed, grounded on the Unified Foundational Ontology and specified in OntoUML, which has been applied in several initiatives, to demonstrate, for example, how it can be used for conceptual modeling and enterprise architecture design, for language evaluation and (re)design, for trust management, for requirements engineering, and for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of affective Human-AI teaming. ONTrust formally characterizes the concept of trust and its different types, describes the different factors that can influence trust, as well as explains how risk emerges from trust relations. To illustrate the working of ONTrust, the ontology is applied to model two case studies extracted from the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4fe1\u4efb\u53c2\u8003\u672c\u4f53ONTrust\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u63d0\u4f9b\u672c\u4f53\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u4fe1\u4efb\u6108\u53d1\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u9700\u4e3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u6784\u5efa\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u672c\u4f53\u5f00\u53d1ONTrust\uff0c\u7528OntoUML\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "result": "ONTrust\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u591a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u80fd\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u4fe1\u4efb\u6982\u5ff5\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86ONTrust\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u672c\u4f53\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Code and data: https://github.com/amughalbscs16/network-layer-quality-testing", "summary": "Modern web applications rely heavily on client-side API calls to fetch data, render content, and communicate with backend services. However, the quality of these network interactions (redundant requests, missing cache headers, oversized payloads, and excessive third-party dependencies) is rarely tested in a systematic way. Moreover, many of these quality deficiencies carry security implications: missing cache headers enable cache poisoning, excessive third-party dependencies expand the supply-chain attack surface, and error responses risk leaking server internals. In this study, we present an automated software testing framework that captures and analyzes the complete HTTP traffic of 18 production websites spanning 11 categories (e-commerce, news, government, developer tools, travel, and more). Using automated browser instrumentation via Playwright, we record 108 HAR (HTTP Archive) files across 3 independent runs per page, then apply 8 heuristic-based anti-pattern detectors to produce a composite quality score (0-100) for each site. Our results reveal a wide quality spectrum: minimalist server-rendered sites achieve perfect scores of 100, while content-heavy commercial sites score as low as 56.8. We identify redundant API calls and missing cache headers as the two most pervasive anti-patterns, each affecting 67% of sites, while third-party overhead exceeds 20% on 72% of sites. One utility site makes 2,684 requests per page load, which is 447x more than the most minimal site. To protect site reputations, all identities are anonymized using category-based pseudonyms. We provide all analysis scripts, anonymized results, and reproducibility instructions as an open artifact.

Existing watermarks insert a signal into generated tokens that either flags LM-generated text (zero-bit watermarking) or encodes more complex messages (multi-bit watermarking). Though a number of recent multi-bit watermarks insert several bits into text without perturbing average next-token predictions, they largely extend design principles from the zero-bit setting, such as encoding a single bit per token. Notably, the information-theoretic capacity of multi-bit watermarking -- the maximum number of bits per token that can be inserted and detected without changing average next-token predictions -- has remained unknown. We address this gap by deriving the first capacity characterization of multi-bit watermarks. Our results inform the design of ArcMark: a new watermark construction based on coding-theoretic principles that, under certain assumptions, achieves the capacity of the multi-bit watermark channel.

The modeling of LTPs and interpretation of LTP experiments rely heavily on accurate data, much of which is hosted on LXCat, a community-driven, open-access platform central to the LTP research ecosystem. To investigate the scholarly impact of the LXCat platform over the past decade, we analyzed a curated corpus of full-text research articles citing three foundational LXCat publications. We present a comprehensive pipeline that integrates chemical entity recognition, dataset and solver mention extraction, affiliation based geographic mapping and topic modeling to extract fine-grained patterns of data usage that reflect implicit research priorities, data practices, differential reliance on specific databases, evolving modes of data reuse and coupling within scientific workflows, and thematic evolution. Importantly, our proposed methodology is domain-agnostic and transferable to other ORI contexts, and highlights the utility of NLP in quantifying the role of scientific data infrastructures and offers a data-driven reflection on how open-access platforms like LXCat contribute to shaping research directions.

However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods.

This limitation suggests the need for an alternative repair paradigm that relies on a representation more accessible to LLMs than raw code, enabling more accurate understanding, analysis, and alignment during repair. To address this gap, we propose VibeRepair, a specification-centric APR technique that treats repair as behavior-specification repair rather than ad-hoc code editing. VibeRepair first translates buggy code into a structured behavior specification that captures the program's intended runtime behavior, then infers and repairs specification misalignments, and finally synthesizes code strictly guided by the corrected behavior specification. An on-demand reasoning component enriches hard cases with program analysis and historical bug-fix evidence while controlling cost. Across Defects4J and real-world benchmarks and multiple LLMs, VibeRepair demonstrates consistently strong repair effectiveness with a significantly smaller patch space. On Defects4J v1.2, VibeRepair correctly repairs 174 bugs, exceeding the strongest state-of-the-art baseline by 28 bugs, which corresponds to a 19% improvement. On Defects4J v2.0, it repairs 178 bugs, outperforming prior approaches by 33 bugs, representing a 23% improvement.

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGRAPHITE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u589e\u52a0\u56fe\u540c\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u56fe\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u56fe\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u7b80\u5355\u7684MLP\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRAPHITE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u76f4\u63a5\u589e\u52a0\u56fe\u540c\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u8282\u70b9\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660eGRAPHITE\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u539f\u672c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u56fe\u7684\u540c\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\u4ec5\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u56fe\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "GRAPHITE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u7684\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u56fe\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Numerical investigations show that this task retains key qualitative aspects of how Transformers develop match-and-copy circuits in practice, and separates architectures by their retrieval capabilities. We also analyze the optimization dynamics in a simplified attention setting. Although many solutions are a priori possible under a regression objective, including ones that do not implement retrieval, we identify an implicit-bias regime in which gradient descent drives the parameters to diverge while their direction aligns with the max-margin separator, yielding hard match selection.

Nevertheless, current inverse graphics methods face tremendous challenges in accurately reconstructing complex geometric details, which often results in the loss of key geometric constraints or structural distortion. To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples.

Robust-OGK-Dorfman-Adaptive-EN offers strong performance under both ideal and contaminated conditions and scales to ultra-high-dimensional settings, making it well suited for modern genomic biomarker discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u7279\u70b9\u63d0\u51fa Dorfman \u7b5b\u9009\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0cRobust - OGK - Dorfman - Adaptive - EN \u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u7ec4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u7279\u5f81\u72ec\u7acb\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Dorfman \u7b5b\u9009\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u7c7b\u5f62\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u7ec4\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u548c\u7ec4\u5185\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u7528\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u6216\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u6539\u8fdb\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u9c81\u68d2\u53d8\u4f53\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e OGK \u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0cDorfman - Sparse - Adaptive - EN \u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6700\u597d\uff0cRobust - OGK - Dorfman - Adaptive - EN \u5728\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u65f6\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e NSCLC \u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2 Dorfman \u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u4f4e\u4e14\u5bcc\u96c6\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u56e0\u6062\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "Dorfman \u6846\u67b6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cRobust - OGK - Dorfman - Adaptive - EN \u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u60f3\u548c\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u8d85\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

Submitted to ACM conference", "summary": "Reproducing computational research is often assumed to be as simple as rerunning the original code with provided data. In practice, missing packages, fragile file paths, version conflicts, or incomplete logic frequently cause analyses to fail, even when materials are shared. This study investigates whether large language models and AI agents can automate the diagnosis and repair of such failures, making computational results easier to reproduce and verify. We evaluate this using a controlled reproducibility testbed built from five fully reproducible R-based social science studies. Realistic failures were injected, ranging from simple issues to complex missing logic, and two automated repair workflows were tested in clean Docker environments. The first workflow is prompt-based, repeatedly querying language models with structured prompts of varying context, while the second uses agent-based systems that inspect files, modify code, and rerun analyses autonomously. Across prompt-based runs, reproduction success ranged from 31-79 percent, with performance strongly influenced by prompt context and error complexity. Complex cases benefited most from additional context. Agent-based workflows performed substantially better, with success rates of 69-96 percent across all complexity levels. These results suggest that automated workflows, especially agent-based systems, can significantly reduce manual effort and improve reproduction success across diverse error types.

While recent advances enable batching (co-locating) multiple adapters during serving, efficient training-time co-location of heterogeneous LoRA adapters presents unique challenges. Jobs often differ in adapter rank, batch size, and resource allocation, and na\u00efve batching can introduce synchronization stalls, communication overheads, and per-job slowdowns that are worse than executing independently. We introduce tLoRA, a framework that enables efficient batch training of multiple LoRA jobs. tLoRA fuses adapters that share the same base model into an elastic shared super-model, exploiting existing distributed training frameworks to derive parallelism plans that share resources effectively. At the kernel level, tLoRA employs a fused LoRA kernel that adaptively reconstructs low-rank computation tiles and schedules rank-aware nano-batches to maximize overlap between computation and communication across adapters. At the scheduling layer, tLoRA incorporates an online, residual-capacity-aware scheduler that adaptively groups jobs to maximize collective throughput. Evaluations using real-world cluster traces demonstrate that tLoRA improves training throughput by 1.2--1.8x, job training completion time by 2.3--5.4x, and GPU utilization by 37%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fatLoRA\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2aLoRA\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6279\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684LoRA\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5e76\u53d1\u6267\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5f02\u6784LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5171\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5b58\u5728\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u8bf8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5171\u4eab\u540c\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u5f39\u6027\u5171\u4eab\u8d85\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u878d\u5408\u7684LoRA\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u5efa\u4f4e\u79e9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5757\u5e76\u8c03\u5ea6\u79e9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u6279\u6b21\uff1b\u5728\u8c03\u5ea6\u5c42\u91c7\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u5269\u4f59\u5bb9\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u96c6\u7fa4\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0ctLoRA\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad81.2 - 1.8\u500d\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed2.3 - 5.4\u500d\uff0cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u63d0\u9ad837%\u3002", "conclusion": "tLoRA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2aLoRA\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6279\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, agentic systems commonly incorporate memory modules to retain and reuse past experience, aiming for continual learning during test time. However, most existing memory designs are human-crafted and fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to the diversity and non-stationarity of real-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks.

As mobile ecosystems evolve, HarmonyOS has emerged as a critical platform requiring robust development tools. Software development for the HarmonyOS ecosystem relies heavily on ArkTS, a statically typed extension of TypeScript. Despite its growing importance, the ecosystem lacks robust tools for automated code repair, primarily due to the absence of a high-quality benchmark for evaluation. To address this gap, we present ArkEval, a unified framework for ArkTS automated repair workflow evaluation and benchmark construction. It provides the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for ArkTS automated program repair. We constructed this benchmark by mining issues from a large-scale official Huawei repository containing over 400 independent ArkTS applications. Through a rigorous multi-stage filtering process, we curated 502 reproducible issues. To ensure testability, we employed a novel LLM-based test generation and voting mechanism involving Claude and other models. Furthermore, we standardized problem statements to facilitate fair evaluation. Finally, we evaluated four state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) on our benchmark using a retrieval-augmented repair workflow.

To meet these requirements, an edge server must render panoramic content, predict user head motion, and transmit a portion of the scene that is large enough to cover the user viewport while remaining within wireless bandwidth constraints. Each portion produces two feedback signals: prediction feedback, indicating whether the selected portion covers the actual viewport, and transmission feedback, indicating whether the corresponding packets are successfully delivered. Prior work models this problem as a multi-armed bandit with two-level bandit feedback, but fails to exploit the fact that prediction feedback can be retrospectively computed for all candidate portions once the user head pose is observed. As a result, prediction feedback constitutes full-information feedback rather than bandit feedback. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a two-level hybrid feedback model that combines full-information and bandit feedback, and formulate the portion selection problem as an online learning task under this setting. We derive an instance-dependent regret lower bound for the hybrid feedback model and propose AdaPort, a hybrid learning algorithm that leverages both feedback types to improve learning efficiency. We further establish an instance-dependent regret upper bound that matches the lower bound asymptotically, and demonstrate through real-world trace driven simulations that AdaPort consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u4e24\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u53caAdaPort\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e24\u7ea7\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u4e8b\u540e\u5168\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u6094\u503c\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAdaPort\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0e\u4e0b\u754c\u6e10\u8fd1\u5339\u914d\u7684\u540e\u6094\u503c\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u8bc1\u660eAdaPort\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u548cAdaPort\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Across tens of thousands of commented threads, Moltbook discussions are dominated by first-layer reactions rather than extended chains. Most comments never receive a direct reply, reciprocal back-and-forth is rare, and when replies do occur they arrive almost immediately -- typically within seconds -- implying persistence on the order of minutes rather than hours. Moltbook is often described as running on an approximately four-hour ``heartbeat'' check-in schedule; using aggregate spectral tests on the longest contiguous activity window, we do not detect a reliable four-hour rhythm in this snapshot, consistent with jittered or out-of-phase individual schedules. A contemporaneous Reddit baseline analyzed with the same estimators shows substantially deeper threads and much longer reply persistence.

GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation. It integrates both deep reasoning and broad information aggregation within unified tasks, and includes a live subset with periodically updated answers to resist memorization. Notably, GISA provides complete human search trajectories for every query, offering gold-standard references for process-level supervision and imitation learning. Experiments on mainstream LLMs and commercial search products reveal that even the best-performing model achieves only 19.30\\% exact match score, with performance notably degrading on tasks requiring complex planning and comprehensive information gathering.

Experts largely agreed with the LLM's quality assessments, especially regarding overall ratings and explanations. However, they did not always agree with the other experts on detailed ratings, suggesting that expertise and experience may influence judgments.

While many prior approaches mitigate this effect through architectural modifications or residual mechanisms, the underlying spectral cause of oversmoothing is often left implicit. We propose Laplacian-LoRA, a simple and interpretable low-rank spectral adaptation of standard GCNs. Rather than redesigning message passing, Laplacian-LoRA introduces a learnable, spectrally anchored correction to the fixed Laplacian propagation operator, selectively weakening contraction while preserving stability and the low-pass inductive bias. Across multiple benchmark datasets and depths, Laplacian-LoRA consistently delays the onset of oversmoothing, extending the effective depth of GCNs by up to a factor of two. Embedding variance diagnostics confirm that these gains arise from delayed representational collapse, while learned spectral analysis demonstrates that the correction is smooth, bounded, and well behaved.

However, its widespread adoption is hindered by a reliance on untestable causal assumptions and by the lack of robustness-oriented evaluation in existing benchmarks. To address these challenges, we propose CausalCompass, a flexible and extensible benchmark suite designed to assess the robustness of time-series causal discovery (TSCD) methods under violations of modeling assumptions. To demonstrate the practical utility of CausalCompass, we conduct extensive benchmarking of representative TSCD algorithms across eight assumption-violation scenarios. Our experimental results indicate that no single method consistently attains optimal performance across all settings. Nevertheless, the methods exhibiting superior overall performance across diverse scenarios are almost invariably deep learning-based approaches. We further provide hyperparameter sensitivity analyses to deepen the understanding of these findings. We also find, somewhat surprisingly, that NTS-NOTEARS relies heavily on standardized preprocessing in practice, performing poorly in the vanilla setting but exhibiting strong performance after standardization. Finally, our work aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of TSCD methods under assumption violations, thereby facilitating their broader adoption in real-world applications.

Such spillovers bias causal estimates and undermine experimental conclusions. Existing approaches face key limitations: user-level randomization ignores network structure, while cluster-based methods often rely on general-purpose clustering that is not tailored for spillover containment and has difficulty balancing unbiasedness and statistical power at scale. We propose a spillover-contained experimentation framework with two stages. In the pre-experiment stage, we build social interaction graphs and introduce a Balanced Louvain algorithm that produces stable, size-balanced clusters while minimizing cross-cluster edges, enabling reliable cluster-based randomization. In the post-experiment stage, we develop a tailored CUPAC estimator that leverages pre-experiment behavioral covariates to reduce the variance induced by cluster-level assignment, thereby improving statistical power. Together, these components provide both structural spillover containment and robust statistical inference. We validate our approach through large-scale social sharing experiments on Kuaishou, a platform serving hundreds of millions of users.

We introduce VertCoHiRF, a fully decentralized framework for vertical federated clustering based on structural consensus across heterogeneous views, allowing each agent to apply a base clustering method adapted to its local feature space in a peer-to-peer manner. Rather than exchanging feature-dependent statistics or relying on noise injection for privacy, agents cluster their local views independently and reconcile their proposals through identifier-level consensus. Consensus is achieved via decentralized ordinal ranking to select representative medoids, progressively inducing a shared hierarchical clustering across agents. Communication is limited to sample identifiers, cluster labels, and ordinal rankings, providing privacy by design while supporting overlapping feature partitions and heterogeneous local clustering methods, and yielding an interpretable shared Cluster Fusion Hierarchy (CFH) that captures cross-view agreement at multiple resolutions.We analyze communication complexity and robustness, and experiments demonstrate competitive clustering performance in vertical federated settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u5168\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6846\u67b6VertCoHiRF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5171\u8bc6\u5b9e\u73b0\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u65f6\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u96c6\u4e2d\u534f\u8c03\u6216\u4ea4\u6362\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u89c6\u56fe\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VertCoHiRF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5404\u4ee3\u7406\u72ec\u7acb\u805a\u7c7b\u672c\u5730\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u7ea7\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5e8f\u6570\u6392\u540d\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5f62\u6210\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u4fe1\u4ec5\u6d89\u53ca\u6837\u672c\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5e8f\u6570\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u53e0\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u533a\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u5c40\u90e8\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u805a\u7c7b\u878d\u5408\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite this progress, it remains unclear which compositional problems are learnable in this setting using outcome-level feedback alone. In this work, we theoretically study the learnability of compositional problems in autoregressive models under RLVR training. We identify a quantity that we call the task-advantage ratio, a joint property of the compositional problem and the base model, that characterizes which tasks and compositions are learnable from outcome-level feedback. On the positive side, using this characterization, we show that compositional problems where correct intermediate steps provide a clear advantage are efficiently learnable with RLVR. We also analyze how such an advantage naturally arises in different problems. On the negative side, when the structural advantage is not present, RLVR may converge to suboptimal compositions. We prove that, in some cases, the quality of the base model determines if such an advantage exists and whether RLVR will converge to a suboptimal solution.

We formalize this risk as Retrieval Pivot Risk (RPR) and introduce companion metrics Leakage@k, Amplification Factor, and Pivot Depth (PD) to quantify leakage magnitude and traversal structure.\n  We present seven Retrieval Pivot Attacks that exploit the vector-to-graph boundary and show that adversarial injection is not required: naturally shared entities create cross-tenant pivot paths organically. Across a synthetic multi-tenant enterprise corpus and the Enron email corpus, the undefended hybrid pipeline exhibits high pivot risk (RPR up to 0.95) with multiple unauthorized items returned per query. Leakage consistently appears at PD=2, which we attribute to the bipartite chunk-entity topology and formalize as a proposition.\n  We then show that enforcing authorization at a single location, the graph expansion boundary, eliminates measured leakage (RPR near 0) across both corpora, all attack variants, and label forgery rates up to 10 percent, with minimal overhead.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), especially their reasoning abilities unlocked through reinforcement learning (RL), have opened new opportunities for tackling tasks with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data. In this paper, we introduce VeriTime, a framework that tailors LLMs for time series reasoning through data synthesis, data scheduling, and RL training. First, we propose a data synthesis pipeline that constructs a TS-text multimodal dataset with process-verifiable annotations. Second, we design a data scheduling mechanism that arranges training samples according to a principled hierarchy of difficulty and task taxonomy. Third, we develop a two-stage reinforcement finetuning featuring fine-grained, multi-objective rewards that leverage verifiable process-level CoT data.

Conventional machine-learning detectors reduce alert volume but still yield many false positives, while standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to justify predictions. We present CyberRAG, a modular agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification, explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent orchestrates: (i) fine-tuned classifiers specialized by attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that queries a domain-specific knowledge base until evidence is relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG, CyberRAG adopts an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This architecture autonomously refines threat labels and natural-language justifications, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability. It is also extensible: new attack types can be supported by adding classifiers without retraining the core agent.

While thresholding scores is Bayes-optimal in the unconstrained setting, using a single threshold generally violates statistical group fairness constraints. Under independence (statistical parity) and separation (equalized odds), such thresholding suffices when the scores already satisfy the corresponding criterion. However, this does not extend to sufficiency: even perfectly group-calibrated scores -- including true class probabilities -- violate predictive parity after thresholding. In this work, we present an exact solution for optimal binary (randomized) classification under sufficiency, assuming finite sets of group-calibrated scores. We provide a geometric characterization of the feasible pairs of positive predictive value (PPV) and false omission rate (FOR) achievable by such classifiers, and use it to derive a simple post-processing algorithm that attains the optimal classifier using only group-calibrated scores and group membership. Finally, since sufficiency and separation are generally incompatible, we identify the classifier that minimizes deviation from separation subject to sufficiency, and show that it can also be obtained by our algorithm, often achieving performance comparable to the optimum.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u5145\u5206\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6b63\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u548c\u5047\u9057\u6f0f\u7387\u53ef\u884c\u5bf9\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7b80\u5355\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u627e\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\u5145\u5206\u6027\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0e\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u9608\u503c\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u8fdd\u53cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u6821\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u5728\u9608\u503c\u5904\u7406\u540e\u4e5f\u4f1a\u8fdd\u53cd\u9884\u6d4b\u5947\u5076\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5047\u8bbe\u6709\u9650\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u6821\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6b63\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u548c\u5047\u9057\u6f0f\u7387\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4f7f\u7528\u7fa4\u4f53\u6821\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u6210\u5458\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u627e\u51fa\u6ee1\u8db3\u5145\u5206\u6027\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0e\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u4e8c\u5143\uff08\u968f\u673a\uff09\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u5145\u5206\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u627e\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\u5145\u5206\u6027\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0e\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5e38\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of text-based clarifying questions in enhancing both retrieval performance and user experience. While images have been shown to improve retrieval performance in various contexts, their impact on user performance when incorporated into clarifying questions remains largely unexplored. We conduct a user study with 73 participants to investigate the role of images in conversational search, specifically examining their effects on two search-related tasks: (i) answering clarifying questions and (ii) query reformulation. We compare the effect of multimodal and text-only clarifying questions in both tasks within a conversational search context from various perspectives. Our findings reveal that while participants showed a strong preference for multimodal questions when answering clarifying questions, preferences were more balanced in the query reformulation task. The impact of images varied with both task type and user expertise. In answering clarifying questions, images helped maintain engagement across different expertise levels, while in query reformulation they led to more precise queries and improved retrieval performance. Interestingly, for clarifying question answering, text-only setups demonstrated better user performance as they provided more comprehensive textual information in the absence of images. These results provide valuable insights for designing effective multimodal conversational search systems, highlighting that the benefits of visual augmentation are task-dependent and should be strategically implemented based on the specific search context and user characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u597d\u5904\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6587\u672c\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u56fe\u50cf\u7528\u4e8e\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u670973\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u56de\u7b54\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u504f\u597d\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\uff1b\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u800c\u5f02\uff1b\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u597d\u5904\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u641c\u7d22\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5f81\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002"}}

A closely related but distinct problem is training models that are robust to internal perturbations to their weights, which may be an important need for future low-power hardware platforms. In this paper, we explore the usage of two methods, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) and random-weight perturbation (RWP), to find minima robust to a variety of random corruptions to weights. We consider the problem from two angles: generalization (how do we reduce the noise-robust generalization gap) and optimization (how do we maximize performance from optimizers when subject to strong perturbations). First, we establish, both theoretically and empirically, that an over-regularized RWP training objective is optimal for noise-robust generalization. For small-magnitude noise, we find that SAM's adversarial objective further improves performance over any RWP configuration, but performs poorly for large-magnitude noise. We link the cause of this to a vanishing-gradient effect, caused by unevenness in the loss landscape, affecting both SAM and RWP.

Concerningly, a pre-registered survey of experts failed to predict this result, highlighting our poor understanding of the inductive biases governing learning and generalisation in LLMs. We use emergent misalignment (EM) as a case study to investigate these inductive biases and find that models can just learn the narrow dataset task, but that the general solution appears to be more stable and more efficient. To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution. This work isolates a concrete representation of general misalignment for monitoring and mitigation.

Most existing robust alignment methods focus on uncertainty in alignment data, while overlooking optimization-induced fragility in preference-based objectives. In this work, we revisit robustness for LLM safety alignment from an optimization geometry perspective, and argue that robustness failures cannot be addressed by data-centric methods alone. We propose ShaPO, a geometry-aware preference optimization framework that enforces worst-case alignment objectives via selective geometry control over alignment-critical parameter subspace. By avoiding uniform geometry constraints, ShaPO mitigates the over-regularization that can harm robustness under distribution shift. We instantiate ShaPO at two levels: token-level ShaPO stabilizes likelihood-based surrogate optimization, while reward-level ShaPO enforces reward-consistent optimization under noisy supervision. Across diverse safety benchmarks and noisy preference settings, ShaPO consistently improves safety robustness over popular preference optimization methods. Moreover, ShaPO composes cleanly with data-robust objectives, yielding additional gains and empirically supporting the proposed optimization-geometry perspective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u504f\u597d\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u8f83\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u63d0\u51faShaPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u9f50\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u504f\u597d\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6ShaPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u6267\u884c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u504f\u597d\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cShaPO\u6bd4\u6d41\u884c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u989d\u5916\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Yet, automated systems that extract locations from text often reproduce existing geographic and socioeconomic biases, leading to uneven visibility of crisis-affected regions. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these geographic disparities in extracting location information from humanitarian documents. We introduce a two-step framework that combines few-shot LLM-based named entity recognition with an agent-based geocoding module that leverages context to resolve ambiguous toponyms. We benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art pretrained and rule-based systems using both accuracy and fairness metrics across geographic and socioeconomic dimensions.

However, their efficacy is fundamentally constrained by static configurations governing agent behaviors, which are fixed prior to execution and fail to adapt to evolving task dynamics. Existing approaches, relying on manual orchestration or heuristic-based patches, often struggle with poor generalization and fragmented optimization. To transcend these limitations, we propose ToolSelf, a novel paradigm enabling tool-driven runtime self-reconfiguration. By abstracting configuration updates as a callable tool, ToolSelf unifies task execution and self-adjustment into a single action space, achieving a phase transition from external rules to intrinsic parameters. Agents can thereby autonomously update their sub-goals and context based on task progression, and correspondingly adapt their strategy and toolbox, transforming from passive executors into dual managers of both task and self. We further devise Configuration-Aware Two-stage Training (CAT), combining rejection sampling fine-tuning with trajectory-level reinforcement learning to internalize this meta-capability. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ToolSelf rivals specialized workflows while generalizing to novel tasks, achieving a 24.1% average performance gain and illuminating a path toward truly self-adaptive agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faToolSelf\u8303\u5f0f\u53caCAT\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u81ea\u6211\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u9759\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u534f\u8c03\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u4fee\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u6563\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faToolSelf\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u914d\u7f6e\u66f4\u65b0\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u53ef\u8c03\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u6574\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1Configuration - Aware Two - stage Training (CAT) \u7ed3\u5408\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cToolSelf\u53ef\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534724.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "ToolSelf\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Introducing greater autonomy to these systems can simultaneously make them more effective as well as reliable. Thus, the ability to rapidly engineer and deploy autonomous aerial systems has become of strategic importance. In the 2010s, a combination of high-performance compute, data, and open-source software led to the current deep learning and AI boom, unlocking decades of prior theoretical work. Robotics is on the cusp of a similar transformation. However, physical AI faces unique hurdles, often combined under the umbrella term \"simulation-to-reality gap\". These span from modeling shortcomings to the complexity of vertically integrating the highly heterogeneous hardware and software systems typically found in field robots. To address the latter, we introduce aerial-autonomy-stack, an open-source, end-to-end framework designed to streamline the pipeline from (GPU-accelerated) perception to (flight controller-based) action. Our stack allows the development of aerial autonomy using ROS2 and provides a common interface for two of the most popular autopilots: PX4 and ArduPilot.

In such a system, we present a unified framework to address the general manipulation task problem. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks. By conducting the ablation study, it is confirmed that the proposed RL with contrastive learning overcomes policy collapse.

We cast it as an Information Bottleneck question: what embedding bottleneck dimension is sufficient to compress predictor and predicted views while preserving their mutual information (MI). This repurposes neural MI estimators for dimensionality estimation. We show that standard neural estimators with separable/bilinear critics systematically inflate the inferred dimension, and we address this by introducing a hybrid critic that retains an explicit dimensional bottleneck while allowing flexible nonlinear cross-view interactions, thereby preserving the latent geometry. We further propose a one-shot protocol that reads off the effective dimension from a single over-parameterized hybrid model, without sweeping over bottleneck sizes. We validate the approach on synthetic problems with known task-relevant dimension.

However, there is no systematic study on their effectiveness in autonomously reproducing Linux kernel vulnerabilities with concrete proofs-of-concept (PoCs). Owing to the size, complexity, and low-level nature of the Linux kernel, such tasks are widely regarded as particularly challenging for current LLM-based approaches.\n  In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of LLM-based Linux kernel vulnerability reproduction. For this purpose, we develop K-Repro, an LLM-based agentic system equipped with controlled code-browsing, virtual machine management, interaction, and debugging capabilities. Using kernel security patches as input, K-Repro automates end-to-end bug reproduction of N-day vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. On a dataset of 100 real-world exploitable Linux kernel vulnerabilities collected from KernelCTF, our results show that K-Repro can generate PoCs that reproduce over 50\\% of the cases with practical time and monetary cost.\n  Beyond aggregate success rates, we perform an extensive study of effectiveness, efficiency, stability, and impact factors to explain when agentic reproduction succeeds, where it fails, and which components drive performance.

To characterize this limitation, we introduce value leakage, a diagnostic notion that captures the unintended activation of non-target values during value steering, along with a normalized leakage metric grounded in Schwartz's value theory. In light of this analysis, we propose NeVA, a neuron-level editing framework for controllable value alignment in LLMs. NeVA identifies sparse, value-relevant neurons and performs inference-time activation editing, enabling fine-grained control without parameter updates or retraining. Experiments show that NeVA achieves stronger target value alignment while incurring smaller performance degradation on general capability.

A common approach is to use predictive distributions from Bayesian or approximation methods and additively decompose uncertainty into aleatoric (i.e., data-related) and epistemic (i.e., model-related) components. However, additive decomposition has recently been questioned, with evidence that it breaks down when using finite-ensemble sampling and/or mismatched predictive distributions. This paper introduces Variance-Gated Ensembles (VGE), an intuitive, differentiable framework that injects epistemic sensitivity via a signal-to-noise gate computed from ensemble statistics. VGE provides: (i) a Variance-Gated Margin Uncertainty (VGMU) score that couples decision margins with ensemble predictive variance; and (ii) a Variance-Gated Normalization (VGN) layer that generalizes the variance-gated uncertainty mechanism to training via per-class, learnable normalization of ensemble member probabilities. We derive closed-form vector-Jacobian products enabling end-to-end training through ensemble sample mean and variance. VGE matches or exceeds state-of-the-art information-theoretic baselines while remaining computationally efficient. As a result, VGE provides a practical and scalable approach to epistemic-aware uncertainty estimation in ensemble models.

Although some previous work tended to handle this challenge via optimization- or structure-level remedies, the overall performance of GCNs still suffers from limited accuracy, poor stability, and unaffordable computational cost. Moreover, neglect of higher-order relationships during the propagation of MPNNs has further limited the performance of them. To overcome these challenges, a novel variant of PageRank named motif-based personalized PageRank (MPPR) is proposed to measure the influence of one node to another on the basis of considering higher-order motif relationships. Secondly, the MPPR is utilized to the message passing process of GCNs, thereby guiding the message passing process at a relatively `high' level. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms almost all of the baselines on accuracy, stability, and time consumption. Additionally, the proposed method can be considered as a component that can underpin almost all GCN tasks, with DGCRL being demonstrated in the experiment.

While existing studies augment LLMs with various knowledge types, it remains unclear how effectively the additional costs translate into accuracy. In this paper, we explore how meta-cognition of LLMs, i.e., their self-awareness of their own knowledge states, can regulate the reasoning process. Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density.

As such data often co-evolves with multiple variables interacting with each other, estimating the time-varying dependencies between variables (i.e., the dynamic network structure) has become crucial for accurate modeling. However, real-world data is often represented as tensor time series with multiple modes, resulting in large, entangled networks that are hard to interpret and computationally intensive to estimate. In this paper, we propose Kronecker Time-Varying Graphical Lasso (KTVGL), a method designed for modeling tensor time series. Our approach estimates mode-specific dynamic networks in a Kronecker product form, thereby avoiding overly complex entangled structures and producing interpretable modeling results. Moreover, the partitioned network structure prevents the exponential growth of computational time with data dimension. In addition, our method can be extended to stream algorithms, making the computational time independent of the sequence length. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed method achieves higher edge estimation accuracy than existing methods while requiring less computation time. To further demonstrate its practical value, we also present a case study using real-world data.

Concept unlearning methods aim at reducing the models' likelihood of generating harmful content.

However, state of the art methods depend on full finetuning, which is computationally expensive. Concept localisation methods can facilitate selective finetuning, but existing techniques are static, resulting in suboptimal utility. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TRUST (Targeted Robust Selective fine Tuning), a novel approach for dynamically estimating target concept neurons and unlearning them through selective finetuning, empowered by a Hessian based regularization.

We dissect this mismatch into two deficiencies: Decoder-Blindness (being oblivious to the non-differentiable decoding process) and Cost-Blindness (prioritizing structural imitation over solution quality). We empirically demonstrate that these intrinsic flaws impose a hard performance ceiling. To overcome this limitation, we propose CADO (Cost-Aware Diffusion models for Optimization), a streamlined Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning framework that formulates the diffusion denoising process as an MDP to directly optimize the post-decoded solution cost. We introduce Label-Centered Reward, which repurposes ground-truth labels as unbiased baselines rather than imitation targets, and Hybrid Fine-Tuning for parameter-efficient adaptation.

This ability, collectively known as general continual learning (GCL), encapsulates practical challenges such as online datastreams and blurry task boundaries. Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment. MePo serves as a plug-in strategy that achieves significant performance gains across a variety of GCL benchmarks and pretrained checkpoints in a rehearsal-free manner (e.g., 15.10\\%, 13.36\\%, and 12.56\\% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200 under Sup-21/1K).

The natural properties of Tensor, especially the memory-continuity and slice-independence, make it feasible for training system to leverage parallel computing unit like GPU to process data simultaneously in batch, spatial or temporal dimensions. However, if we look beyond perception tasks, the data in a complicated cognitive AI system usually has hierarchical structures (i.e. nested data) with various modalities. They are inconvenient and inefficient to program directly with conventional Tensor with fixed shape. To address this issue, we summarize two main computational patterns of nested data, and then propose a general nested data container: TreeTensor. Through various constraints and magic utilities of TreeTensor, one can apply arbitrary functions and operations to nested data with almost zero cost, including some famous machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy and PyTorch. Our approach utilizes a constrained tree-structure perspective to systematically model data relationships, and it can also easily be combined with other methods to extend more usages, such as asynchronous execution and variable-length data computation. Detailed examples and benchmarks show TreeTensor not only provides powerful usability in various problems, especially one of the most complicated AI systems at present: AlphaStar for StarCraftII, but also exhibits excellent runtime efficiency without any overhead.

In this work, we propose a first-principles framework for information dynamics, treating the attention mechanism as a physical system governed by the principle of least action rather than as an algorithmic optimization. By mapping information states to a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher information metric, we derive the intelligence Lagrangian. We show that the softmax function corresponds to the unique thermodynamic equilibrium state that minimizes the Helmholtz free energy of the information gas. In addition, we identify the query-key interaction as an electrodynamic coupling between an external field and an intrinsic dipole moment. This theory establishes the first law of information thermodynamics, unifying inference (mechanical work) and learning (chemical evolution). It also explains emergent phenomena, such as scaling laws and grokking, as phase transitions characterized by the divergence of specific heat.

Across a wide range of models and tasks, Sketch&Walk maintains near-lossless accuracy at 20% attention density and can slightly outperform dense attention in some settings, while achieving up to 6x inference speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5Sketch&Walk Attention\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Hadamard sketching\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7walk\u673a\u5236\u805a\u5408\u5404\u5c42\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7528\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u6570\u9009\u62e9top - k\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\u3002", "result": "\u572820%\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53476\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Sketch&Walk Attention\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

The best-known adaptive regret bounds are achieved by Shampoo-like methods, but they require solving a costly quadratic projection subproblem. To address this, we extend the gradient-based prediction scheme to adaptive matrix online learning and cast algorithm design as constructing a family of smoothed potentials for the nuclear norm. We define a notion of admissibility for such smoothings and prove any admissible smoothing yields a regret bound matching the best-known guarantees of one-sided Shampoo. We instantiate this framework with two efficient methods that avoid quadratic projections. The first is an adaptive Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) method using Gaussian stochastic smoothing. The second is Follow-the-Augmented-Matrix-Leader (FAML), which uses a deterministic hyperbolic smoothing in an augmented matrix space. By analyzing the admissibility of these smoothings, we show both methods admit closed-form updates and match one-sided Shampoo's regret up to a constant factor, while significantly reducing computational cost. Lastly, using the online-to-nonconvex conversion, we derive two matrix-based optimizers, Pion (from FTPL) and Leon (from FAML).

However, as the amount of context grows, their reliability often deteriorates, a phenomenon known as \"context rot\". Existing long-context benchmarks primarily focus on single-step settings that evaluate a model's ability to retrieve information from a long snippet. In realistic scenarios, however, LLMs often need to act as agents that explore environments, follow instructions and plans, extract useful information, and predict correct actions under a dynamically growing context. To assess language agents in such settings, we introduce LOCA-bench (a benchmark for LOng-Context Agents). Given a task prompt, LOCA-bench leverages automated and scalable control of environment states to regulate the agent's context length. This design enables LOCA-bench to extend the context length potentially to infinity in a controlled way while keeping the underlying task semantics fixed. LOCA-bench evaluates language agents as a combination of models and scaffolds, including various context management strategies. While agent performance generally degrades as the environment states grow more complex, advanced context management techniques can substantially improve the overall success rate.

A common metric for this, inspired by Boolean function analysis, is average sensitivity, which captures a model's robustness to single-token perturbations. We argue that average sensitivity has two key limitations: it lacks a natural generalization to real-valued domains and fails to explain the \"junta-like\" input dependence we empirically observe in modern LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose noise stability as a more comprehensive simplicity metric. Noise stability expresses a model's robustness to correlated noise applied to all input coordinates simultaneously. We provide a theoretical analysis of noise stability for single-layer attention and ReLU MLP layers and tackle the multi-layer propagation problem with a covariance interval propagation approach.

While recent data-driven methods promise to accelerate parts of this process, they largely fail to support end-to-end scientific discovery. To address this gap, we introduce EXPERIGEN, an agentic framework that operationalizes end-to-end discovery through a Bayesian optimization inspired two-phase search, in which a Generator proposes candidate hypotheses and an Experimenter evaluates them empirically. Across multiple domains, EXPERIGEN consistently discovers 2-4x more statistically significant hypotheses that are 7-17 percent more predictive than prior approaches, and naturally extends to complex data regimes including multimodal and relational datasets. Beyond statistical performance, hypotheses must be novel, empirically grounded, and actionable to drive real scientific progress. To evaluate these qualities, we conduct an expert review of machine-generated hypotheses, collecting feedback from senior faculty. Among 25 reviewed hypotheses, 88 percent were rated moderately or strongly novel, 70 percent were deemed impactful and worth pursuing, and most demonstrated rigor comparable to senior graduate-level research. Finally, recognizing that ultimate validation requires real-world evidence, we conduct the first A/B test of LLM-generated hypotheses, observing statistically significant results with p less than 1e-6 and a large effect size of 344 percent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165EXPERIGEN\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u793e\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u548cA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u6210\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u793e\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165EXPERIGEN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u641c\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cGenerator\u63d0\u51fa\u5019\u9009\u5047\u8bbe\uff0cExperimenter\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a2 - 4\u500d\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u9ad87 - 17%\uff1b2. \u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a88%\u5047\u8bbe\u5177\u4e00\u5b9a\u65b0\u9896\u6027\uff0c70%\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u503c\u5f97\u7814\u7a76\uff1b3.

Failure to meet these conditions can place reuse outside the scope of the license, effectively leaving AI artifacts under default copyright for those uses and exposing downstream users to litigation. We call this phenomenon ``permissive washing'': labeling AI artifacts as free to use, while omitting the legal documentation required to make that label actionable.

We propose the first BO algorithm that achieves no-regret guarantee in a general reward setting, requiring only Lipschitz continuity of the objective function and accommodating a broad class of measurement noise. The core of our approach is a novel surrogate model, termed as infinite Gaussian process ($\\infty$-GP). It is a Bayesian nonparametric model that places a prior on the space of reward distributions, enabling it to represent a substantially broader class of reward models than classical Gaussian process (GP). The $\\infty$-GP is used in combination with Thompson Sampling (TS) to enable effective exploration and exploitation. Correspondingly, we develop a new TS regret analysis framework for general rewards, which relates the regret to the total variation distance between the surrogate model and the true reward distribution.

While prior work on IGL provides efficient algorithms with provable guarantees, those results are confined to single-step settings, restricting their applicability to modern sequential decision-making systems such as multi-turn Large Language Model (LLM) deployments. To bridge this gap, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves a sublinear regret guarantee for contextual episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with personalized feedback. Technically, we extend the reward-estimator construction of Zhang et al.

In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers.

Conventional disaster management frameworks rely on static simulations and passive data acquisition, hindering their ability to adapt to arbitrarily evolving wildfire episodes in real-time. To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis. We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining. Our results indicate marked reductions in detection-to-intervention latency and more effective resource coordination versus traditional systems.

Capturing chirality in machine learning models remains challenging due to the geometric complexity of stereochemical relationships and the limitations of traditional molecular representations that often lack explicit stereochemical encoding. Existing approaches to chiral molecular representation primarily focus on central chirality, relying on handcrafted stereochemical tags or limited 3D encodings, and thus fail to generalize to more complex forms such as axial chirality. In this work, we introduce ChiDeK (Chiral Determinant Kernels), a framework that systematically integrates stereogenic information into molecular representation learning. We propose the chiral determinant kernel to encode the SE(3)-invariant chirality matrix and employ cross-attention to integrate stereochemical information from local chiral centers into the global molecular representation. This design enables explicit modeling of chiral-related features within a unified architecture, capable of jointly encoding central and axial chirality. To support the evaluation of axial chirality, we construct a new benchmark for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and optical rotation (OR) prediction.

Therefore, it is crucial to design an algorithm that accelerates each individual test. To this end, we propose the Flow Matching-based Conditional Independence Test (FMCIT). The proposed test leverages the high computational efficiency of flow matching and requires the model to be trained only once throughout the entire causal discovery procedure, substantially accelerating causal discovery. According to numerical experiments, FMCIT effectively controls type-I error and maintains high testing power under the alternative hypothesis, even in the presence of high-dimensional conditioning sets.

However, real-world clinical needs include not only effectiveness, but also reliability and reasonable deployment cost. Since clinical decision-making is inherently collaborative, we challenge the monolithic scaling paradigm and ask whether a Small Agent Group (SAG) can support better clinical reasoning. SAG shifts from single-model intelligence to collective expertise by distributing reasoning, evidence-based analysis, and critical audit through a collaborative deliberation process. To assess the clinical utility of SAG, we conduct extensive evaluations using diverse clinical metrics spanning effectiveness, reliability, and deployment cost. Our results show that SAG achieves superior performance compared to a single giant model, both with and without additional optimization or retrieval-augmented generation.

This work presents a structure-aware and robustness-oriented counterfactual search method based on the conditional Gaussian network classifier (CGNC). The CGNC has a generative structure that encodes conditional dependencies and potential causal relations among features through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure naturally embeds feature relationships into the search process, eliminating the need for additional constraints to ensure consistency with the model's structural assumptions. We adopt a convergence-guaranteed cutting-set procedure as an adversarial optimization framework, which iteratively approximates solutions that satisfy global robustness conditions. To address the nonconvex quadratic structure induced by feature dependencies, we apply piecewise McCormick relaxation to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), ensuring global optimality. Experimental results show that our method achieves strong robustness, with direct global optimization of the original formulation providing especially stable and efficient results.

The vast majority of existing anomaly diagnosis methods offer limited theoretical insights, especially for anomaly localization, which is a vital but largely unexplored area. The aim of this contribution is to study the learning process of a Transformer when applied to MTS by revealing connections to statistical time series methods. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose the Attention Low-Rank Transformer (ALoRa-T) model, which applies low-rank regularization to self-attention, and we introduce the Attention Low-Rank score, effectively capturing the temporal characteristics of anomalies. Finally, to enable anomaly localization, we propose the ALoRa-Loc method, a novel approach that associates anomalies to specific variables by quantifying interrelationships among time series.

We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as \"malloc-only\" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.\n  Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%.

While deep learning shows promise in processing B-rep models, existing methods suffer from a representation gap: continuous approaches offer analytical precision but are visually abstract, whereas discrete methods provide intuitive clarity at the expense of geometric precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce Brep2Shape, a novel self-supervised pre-training method designed to align abstract boundary representations with intuitive shape representations. Our method employs a geometry-aware task where the model learns to predict dense spatial points from parametric B\u00e9zier control points, enabling the network to better understand physical manifolds derived from abstract coefficients. To enhance this alignment, we propose a Dual Transformer backbone with parallel streams that independently encode surface and curve tokens to capture their distinct geometric properties. Moreover, the topology attention is integrated to model the interdependencies between surfaces and curves, thereby maintaining topological consistency.

They offer a principled way to quantify predictive epistemic uncertainty (EU) and have been shown to improve model robustness in various settings.

To address this, we define EU as disagreement among models trained with varying relaxations of the i.i.d. assumption between training and test data. Based on this idea, we propose CreDRO, which learns an ensemble of plausible models through distributionally robust optimization.

This strategy not only reduces labeling expenses but also results in energy savings during neural network training, thereby enhancing both data and energy efficiency. In this paper, we implement and evaluate various state-of-the-art acquisition functions, analyzing their accuracy and computational costs, while discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Our findings reveal that representativity-based acquisition functions effectively explore the dataset but do not prioritize boundary decisions, whereas uncertainty-based acquisition functions focus on refining boundary decisions already identified by the neural network. This trade-off is known as the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To address this dilemma, we introduce six aggregation structures: series, parallel, hybrid, adaptive feedback, random exploration, and annealing exploration. Our aggregated acquisition functions alleviate common AL pathologies such as batch mode inefficiency and the cold start problem. Additionally, we focus on balancing accuracy and energy consumption, contributing to the development of more sustainable, energy-aware artificial intelligence (AI). We evaluate our proposed structures on various models and datasets. Our results demonstrate the potential of these structures to reduce computational costs while maintaining or even improving accuracy. Innovative aggregation approaches, such as alternating between acquisition functions such as BALD and BADGE, have shown robust results.

AI models for biology are trained on large volumes of data, including data related to biological sequences, structures, images, and functions. The type of data used to train a model is intimately tied to the capabilities it ultimately possesses--including those of biosecurity concern. For this reason, an international group of more than 100 researchers at the recent 50th anniversary Asilomar Conference endorsed data controls to prevent the use of AI for harmful applications such as bioweapons development. To help design such controls, we introduce a five-tier Biosecurity Data Level (BDL) framework for categorizing pathogen data. Each level contains specific data types, based on their expected ability to contribute to capabilities of concern when used to train AI models. For each BDL tier, we propose technical restrictions appropriate to its level of risk. Finally, we outline a novel governance framework for newly created dual-use pathogen data.

A popular and promising approach is to regularize actor-critic methods with behavior cloning (BC), which yields realistic policies and mitigates bias from out-of-distribution actions, but can impose an often-overlooked performance ceiling: when dataset actions are suboptimal, indiscriminate imitation structurally prevents the actor from fully exploiting high-value regions suggested by the critic, especially in later training when imitation is already dominant. We formally analyzed this limitation by investigating convergence properties of BC-regularized actor-critic optimization and verified it on a controlled continuous bandit task. To break this ceiling, we propose proximal action replacement (PAR), a plug-and-play training sample replacer that progressively replaces low-value actions with high-value actions generated by a stable actor, broadening the action exploration space while reducing the impact of low-value data.

To address this challenge, we present CauScale, a neural architecture designed for efficient causal discovery that scales inference to graphs with up to 1000 nodes. CauScale improves time efficiency via a reduction unit that compresses data embeddings and improves space efficiency by adopting tied attention weights to avoid maintaining axis-specific attention maps. To keep high causal discovery accuracy, CauScale adopts a two-stream design: a data stream extracts relational evidence from high-dimensional observations, while a graph stream integrates statistical graph priors and preserves key structural signals. CauScale successfully scales to 500-node graphs during training, where prior work fails due to space limitations. Across testing data with varying graph scales and causal mechanisms, CauScale achieves 99.6% mAP on in-distribution data and 84.4% on out-of-distribution data, while delivering 4-13,000 times inference speedups over prior methods.

In this paper, we identify this assumption as Dogma 4 of Reinforcement Learning (RL). We demonstrate that while this dogma holds in static environments, it fails in social settings where evaluators may be sycophantic, lazy, or adversarial. We prove that under Dogma 4, standard RL agents suffer from what we call Objective Decoupling, a structural failure mode where the agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth, guaranteeing convergence to misalignment. To resolve this, we propose Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA). Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself. We prove that this \"judging the judges\" mechanism guarantees convergence to the true objective, even when a majority of evaluators are biased.

We introduce a two-stage gradient-based framework that provides interpretable diagnostics for three critical failure analysis tasks: (1) detecting the true initial failure source (Patient-0); (2) validating why non-attacked agents may be flagged first due to domino effects; and (3) tracing how failures propagate through learned coordination pathways. Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs.

However, conventional practices rely on random sequences of fixed length, overlooking the variable-length nature of LLM inputs. Input length directly influences the activation distribution and, consequently, the weight importance captured by the Hessian, which in turn affects quantization outcomes. As a result, Hessian estimates derived from fixed-length calibration may fail to represent the true importance of weights across diverse input scenarios. We propose MaCa (Matryoshka Calibration), a simple yet effective method for length-aware Hessian construction. MaCa (i) incorporates multi-scale sequence length information into Hessian estimation and (ii) regularizes each sequence as an independent sample, yielding a more stable and fruitful Hessian for accurate quantization. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, Gemma3, LLaMA3) demonstrate that MaCa consistently improves accuracy under low bit quantization, offering a lightweight enhancement compatible with existing PTQ frameworks.

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targets these mechanisms but faces scalability challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers potential for delivering personalized DBT coaching at scale, yet rapid development has outpaced safety infrastructure. Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an \"empathy trap,\" providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic safety evaluation of GenAI-delivered DBT coaching for HIV and substance use risk reduction. Findings reveal vulnerabilities requiring mitigation before clinical trials. The HHH framework and user-driven adversarial testing offer replicable methods for evaluating GenAI mental health interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1GenAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684DBT\u6280\u80fd\u6559\u7ec3Glow\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6709\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u9700\u7f13\u89e3\u53ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "HIV\u548c\u7269\u8d28\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u5171\u540c\u5fc3\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0cDBT\u5e94\u5bf9\u9762\u4e34\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0cGenAI\u53ef\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316DBT\u8f85\u5bfc\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u7840\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1GenAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684DBT\u6280\u80fd\u6559\u7ec3Glow\uff0c\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u536b\u751f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5408\u4f5c\u5f00\u5c55\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528HHH\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "Glow\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u740673%\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9f13\u52b1\u7269\u8d28\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u4e0d\u826f\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u5931\u8d25\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b027\u4f8bDBT\u6280\u80fd\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9GenAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684DBT\u8f85\u5bfc\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9700\u7f13\u89e3\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0cHHH\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u9a71\u52a8\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30GenAI\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5e72\u9884\u3002"}}

Such explicit reasoning requires extended context lengths, resulting in substantially higher resource consumption. Prior work has shown that adversarially crafted inputs can trigger redundant reasoning processes, exposing LRMs to resource-exhaustion vulnerabilities. However, the reasoning process itself, especially its reflective component, has received limited attention, even though it can lead to over-reflection and consume excessive computing power. In this paper, we introduce Recursive Entropy to quantify the risk of resource consumption in reflection, thereby revealing the safety issues inherent in inference itself. Based on Recursive Entropy, we introduce RECUR, a resource exhaustion attack via Recursive Entropy guided Counterfactual Utilization and Reflection.

In contrast, we argue that with a well-chosen D'(x), the shift can be positive and make learning easier -- a perspective called Positive Distribution Shift (PDS). Such a perspective is central to contemporary machine learning, where much of the innovation is in finding good training distributions D'(x), rather than changing the training algorithm.

The method employs a structured spike-and-slab prior for sparsity, a mixture of Gaussians to approximate the intractable multimodal posterior, and a Jaccard-based penalty to further control solution diversity. Unlike sequential greedy approaches, GEMSS optimizes the entire ensemble of solutions within a single objective function via stochastic gradient descent.\n  The method is validated on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 128 synthetic experiments across classification and regression tasks. Results demonstrate that GEMSS scales effectively to high-dimensional settings ($p=5000$) with sample size as small as $n = 50$, generalizes seamlessly to continuous targets, handles missing data natively, and exhibits remarkable robustness to class imbalance and Gaussian noise.\n  GEMSS is available as a Python package 'gemss' at PyPI.

To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28.

However, classical LoRA training methods treat the low-rank factor matrices individually and optimize them using standard gradient-based algorithms. Such decoupled optimization schemes are theoretically and empirically suboptimal, as they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic structure of the LoRA parameterization. In this work, we propose a novel continuous-time optimization dynamic for LoRA factor matrices in the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that emulates the gradient flow of full fine-tuning on the balanced manifold. We term this approach ODELoRA. To faithfully track the trajectories of ODELoRA, we adopt well-established and theoretically grounded time-discretization schemes, including Euler and Runge--Kutta methods. Our framework provides a unified ODE-based perspective for understanding and designing LoRA training algorithms. We establish linear convergence of the proposed method under strongly convex objectives for certain discretization schemes under mild conditions, and further extend our analysis to the matrix sensing setting. Moreover, we show that ODELoRA achieves stable feature learning, a property that is crucial for training deep neural networks at different scales of problem dimensionality. Empirical results on matrix sensing tasks confirm the derived linear convergence behavior, and experiments on training physics-informed neural networks further demonstrate the superiority of ODELoRA over existing baselines, especially in the training stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08ODE\uff09\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\uff08LoRA\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5ODELoRA\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00ODE\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u8bbe\u8ba1LoRA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178LoRA\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u79e9\u56e0\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3aLoRA\u56e0\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7684ODELoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6210\u719f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e00\u5b9a\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u77e9\u9635\u4f20\u611f\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7a33\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u77e9\u9635\u4f20\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "ODELoRA\u4e3aLoRA\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eODE\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient alternative due to their event-driven nature; however, their integration with continuous Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) representations is fundamentally challenged by distribution mismatch, where high-dynamic-range embeddings degrade the information coding capacity of threshold-based neurons. To resolve this, we propose Prompt-Tuned Spiking Neural Networks (PTS-SNN), a parameter-efficient neuromorphic adaptation framework that aligns frozen SSL backbones with spiking dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Shift Spiking Encoder to capture local temporal dependencies via parameter-free channel shifts, establishing a stable feature basis. To bridge the domain gap, we devise a Context-Aware Membrane Potential Calibration strategy. This mechanism leverages a Spiking Sparse Linear Attention module to aggregate global semantic context into learnable soft prompts, which dynamically regulate the bias voltages of Parametric Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (PLIF) neurons. This regulation effectively centers the heterogeneous input distribution within the responsive firing range, mitigating functional silence or saturation. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets (e.g., IEMOCAP, CASIA, EMODB) demonstrate that PTS-SNN achieves 73.34\\% accuracy on IEMOCAP, comparable to competitive Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while requiring only 1.19M trainable parameters and 0.35 mJ inference energy per sample.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\uff08SER\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPTS - SNN\u5e94\u5bf9SNN\u4e0e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SSL\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSER\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u800cSNN\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eedSSL\u7ed3\u5408\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPrompt - Tuned Spiking Neural Networks\uff08PTS - SNN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Temporal Shift Spiking Encoder\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Context - Aware Membrane Potential Calibration\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cPTS - SNN\u5728IEMOCAP\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe73.34%\uff0c\u4e0eANN\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4ec5\u97001.19M\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u548c0.35 mJ\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "PTS - SNN\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3SNN\u4e0eSSL\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

We argue that this limitation stems from inadequate credit assignment for visual attention during training. To address this issue, we propose SAYO, a visual reasoning model trained with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that introduces a region-level visual attention-based reward.

Such designs offer limited capacity for structural exploration, making it difficult to escape deep local optima in complex Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). In this work, we propose G-LNS, a generative evolutionary framework that extends LLM-based AHD to the automated design of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operators. Unlike prior methods that evolve heuristics in isolation, G-LNS leverages LLMs to co-evolve tightly coupled pairs of destroy and repair operators. A cooperative evaluation mechanism explicitly captures their interaction, enabling the discovery of complementary operator logic that jointly performs effective structural disruption and reconstruction. Extensive experiments on challenging COP benchmarks, such as Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP), demonstrate that G-LNS significantly outperforms LLM-based AHD methods as well as strong classical solvers.

This reliance on expert knowledge limits their adaptability to new behaviors, and only enables analysis related to the learned rewards, and not across the behavior modes used to train them. We propose Contrastive Multi-Intention IRL (CoMI-IRL), a transformer-based unsupervised framework that decouples behavior representation and clustering from downstream reward learning.

This paper introduces the Pavlovian Associative Learning Models Simulator (PALMS), a Python environment to simulate Pavlovian conditioning experiments. In addition to the canonical Rescorla-Wagner model, PALMS incorporates several attentional learning approaches, including Pearce-Kaye-Hall, Mackintosh Extended, Le Pelley's Hybrid, and a novel extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model with a unified variable learning rate that integrates Mackintosh's and Pearce and Hall's opposing conceptualisations. The simulator's graphical interface allows for the input of entire experimental designs in an alphanumeric format, akin to that used by experimental neuroscientists. Moreover, it uniquely enables the simulation of experiments involving hundreds of stimuli, as well as the computation of configural cues and configural-cue compounds across all models, thereby considerably expanding their predictive capabilities. PALMS operates efficiently, providing instant visualisation of results, supporting rapid, precise comparisons of various models' predictions within a single architecture and environment. Furthermore, graphic displays can be easily saved, and simulated data can be exported to spreadsheets. To illustrate the simulator's capabilities and functionalities, we provide a detailed description of the software and examples of use, reproducing published experiments in the associative learning literature.

Meanwhile, the rapid proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents has intensified demand for highly personalized services that require the dynamic provision of diverse personal data. This presents a significant challenge: balancing the utilization of such data with privacy protection. To address this challenge, we propose Puda (Private User Dataset Agent), a user-sovereign architecture that aggregates data across services and enables client-side management. Puda allows users to control data sharing at three privacy levels: (i) Detailed Browsing History, (ii) Extracted Keywords, and (iii) Predefined Category Subsets. We implemented Puda as a browser-based system that serves as a common platform across diverse services and evaluated it through a personalized travel planning task. Our results show that providing Predefined Category Subsets achieves 97.2% of the personalization performance (evaluated via an LLM-as-a-Judge framework across three criteria) obtained when sharing Detailed Browsing History. These findings demonstrate that Puda enables effective multi-granularity management, offering practical choices to mitigate the privacy-personalization trade-off.

However, deploying such powerful agents on mobile devices remains a major challenge. On one hand, the intricate multi-modal state representation and hierarchical action space of HoK demand large, sophisticated policy networks that are inherently difficult to compress into lightweight forms. On the other hand, production deployment requires high-frequency inference under strict energy and latency constraints on mobile platform. To the best of our knowledge, bridging large-scale game AI and practical on-device deployment has not been systematically studied. In this work, we propose a Pareto optimality guided pipeline and design a high-efficiency student architecture search space tailored for mobile execution, enabling systematic exploration of the trade-off between performance and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the distilled model achieves remarkable efficiency, including an $12.4\\times$ faster inference speed (under 0.5ms per frame) and a $15.6\\times$ improvement in energy efficiency (under 0.5mAh per game), while retaining a 40.32% win rate against the original teacher model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u5f15\u5bfc\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u9002\u5408\u79fb\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u751f\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6e38\u620fAI\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6e38\u620fAI\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6e38\u620fAI\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8854\u63a5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u5f15\u5bfc\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9002\u5408\u79fb\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u751f\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb12.4\u500d\uff08\u6bcf\u5e27\u4f4e\u4e8e0.5ms\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad815.6\u500d\uff08\u6bcf\u573a\u6e38\u620f\u4f4e\u4e8e0.5mAh\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u9635\u539f\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u80dc\u738740.32%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6e38\u620fAI\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we propose the \\texttt{Structural Context Model}, a formal model for analyzing and comparing LLM agents from the perspective of context structure.

The proposed workflow provides principled insights into agent mechanisms and supports rapid, systematic design iteration.

To address this, we propose MedVerse, a reasoning framework for complex medical inference that reformulates medical reasoning as a parallelizable directed acyclic graph (DAG) process based on Petri net theory. The framework adopts a full-stack design across data, model architecture, and system execution. For data creation, we introduce the MedVerse Curator, an automated pipeline that synthesizes knowledge-grounded medical reasoning paths and transforms them into Petri net-structured representations. At the architectural level, we propose a topology-aware attention mechanism with adaptive position indices that supports parallel reasoning while preserving logical consistency. Systematically, we develop a customized inference engine that supports parallel execution without additional overhead. Empirical evaluations show that MedVerse improves strong general-purpose LLMs by up to 8.9%.

Whereas machine learning has been described as the automation of automation, generative AI operates by navigating contextual, semantic, and stylistic coherence rather than optimizing predefined objective metrics. This paper introduces the concept of Vibe-Automation to characterize this transition.\n  The central claim is that the significance of GenAI lies in its functional access to operationalized tacit regularities: context-sensitive patterns embedded in practice that cannot be fully specified through explicit algorithmic rules. Although generative systems do not possess tacit knowledge in a phenomenological sense, they operationalize sensitivities to tone, intent, and situated judgment encoded in high-dimensional latent representations. On this basis, the human role shifts from algorithmic problem specification toward Vibe-Engineering, understood as the orchestration of alignment and contextual judgment in generative systems.\n  The paper connects this epistemological shift to educational and institutional transformation by proposing a conceptual framework structured across three analytical levels and three domains of action: faculty worldview, industry relations, and curriculum design. The risks of mode collapse and cultural homogenization are briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for deliberate engagement with generative systems to avoid regression toward synthetic uniformity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e26\u6765\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u6c1b\u56f4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u7c7b\u89d2\u8272\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u8fde\u63a5\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u5236\u5ea6\u53d8\u9769\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u8f6c\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5176\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u6c1b\u56f4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u4e09\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u5c42\u6b21\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u884c\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u5728\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9690\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u89d2\u8272\u8f6c\u5411\u2018\u6c1b\u56f4\u5de5\u7a0b\u2019\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u501f\u52a9\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u52a8\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u53d8\u9769\uff0c\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u5bf9\u5f85\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u6587\u5316\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u3002"}}

While prior studies have explored sycophantic behavior in general contexts, its impact on morally grounded visual decision-making remains insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of moral sycophancy in VLMs, analyzing ten widely-used models on the Moralise and M^3oralBench datasets under explicit user disagreement. Our results reveal that VLMs frequently produce morally incorrect follow-up responses even when their initial judgments are correct, and exhibit a consistent asymmetry: models are more likely to shift from morally right to morally wrong judgments than the reverse when exposed to user-induced bias. Follow-up prompts generally degrade performance on Moralise, while yielding mixed or even improved accuracy on M^3oralBench, highlighting dataset-dependent differences in moral robustness. Evaluation using Error Introduction Rate (EIR) and Error Correction Rate (ECR) reveals a clear trade-off: models with stronger error-correction capabilities tend to introduce more reasoning errors, whereas more conservative models minimize errors but exhibit limited ability to self-correct.

However, training these systems remains notoriously difficult due to the credit assignment challenge, as it is often unclear which specific functional agent is responsible for the success or failure of decision trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on sparse or globally broadcast rewards, failing to capture individual contributions and leading to inefficient reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency. Extensive experiments across various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SHARP significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average match improvements of 23.66% and 14.05% over single-agent and multi-agent approaches, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSHARP\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u6311\u6218\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u5168\u5c40\u5e7f\u64ad\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e2a\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SHARP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b\u5168\u5c40\u5e7f\u64ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eShapley\u503c\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u4fe1\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u5904\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ec4\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f18\u52bf\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSHARP\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fd1\u671f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad823.66%\u548c14.05%\u3002", "conclusion": "SHARP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002"}}

In Time Series Classification (TSC), ensembles have proven highly effective whether based on neural networks (NNs) or traditional methods like HIVE-COTE. However most existing NN-based ensemble methods for TSC train multiple models with identical architectures and configurations. These ensembles aggregate predictions without explicitly promoting diversity which often leads to redundant feature representations and limits the benefits of ensembling. In this work, we introduce a diversity-driven ensemble learning framework that explicitly encourages feature diversity among neural network ensemble members. Our approach employs a decorrelated learning strategy using a feature orthogonality loss applied directly to the learned feature representations. This ensures that each model in the ensemble captures complementary rather than redundant information. We evaluate our framework on 128 datasets from the UCR archive and show that it achieves SOTA performance with fewer models.

A key limitation is that many VLMs rely on surface correlations rather than building logically coherent structured representations, which often leads to missed higher-level semantic structure and non-causal relational understanding, hindering compositional and verifiable reasoning. To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Here, we present the Pretrained Variational Bridge (PVB) in an encoder-decoder fashion, which maps the initial structure into a noised latent space and transports it toward stage-specific targets through augmented bridge matching. This unifies training on both single-structure and paired trajectory data, enabling consistent use of cross-domain structural knowledge across training stages. Moreover, for protein-ligand complexes, we further introduce a reinforcement learning-based optimization via adjoint matching that speeds progression toward the holo state, which supports efficient post-optimization of docking poses.

In this paper, we propose an effect-centric, admissibility-first framework that treats discovered graphs as structural hypotheses and evaluates them by identifiability, stability, and falsification rather than by graph recovery accuracy alone. Empirically, we study the effect of early exposure to competitive gameplay on short-term retention using real-world game telemetry. We find that many statistically plausible discovery outputs do not admit point-identified causal queries once minimal temporal and semantic constraints are enforced, highlighting identifiability as a critical bottleneck for decision support. When identification is possible, several algorithm families converge to similar, decision-consistent effect estimates despite producing substantially different graph structures, including cases where the direct treatment-outcome edge is absent and the effect is preserved through indirect causal pathways. These converging estimates survive placebo, subsampling, and sensitivity refutation. In contrast, other methods exhibit sporadic admissibility and threshold-sensitive or attenuated effects due to endpoint ambiguity. These results suggest that graph-level metrics alone are inadequate proxies for causal reliability for a given target query.

Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0b\u5e76\u884c\u601d\u7ef4\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faOutline - Guided Path Exploration (OPE)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u5e76\u884c\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u805a\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bf9\u8def\u5f84\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u5173\u6ce8\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u63a2\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u9650\u5236\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOPE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u7eb2\u5212\u5206\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u7eb2\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5927\u7eb2\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOPE\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u627e\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "OPE\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u601d\u7ef4\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Existing mitigation strategies often face critical limitations: they either yield insufficient outlier suppression or incur significant deployment inefficiencies, such as inference latency, heavy preprocessing, or reliance on complex operator fusion. To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy. Crucially, Astro introduces zero inference latency and is orthogonal to mainstream quantization methods like GPTQ.

Near state-of-the-art performance can be simply achieved by counting co-occurrences, without using any temporal information. In this work, we examine the root cause of this issue, identifying inherent biases in current datasets and over simplified form of evaluation task that can be exploited by these biases.

In a further in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, we surprisingly uncover and empirically verify that LRMs implicitly know the appropriate time to stop thinking, while this capability is obscured by current sampling paradigms.

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMemAdapter\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u5f02\u6784\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8303\u5f0f\u5feb\u901f\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b64\u7acb\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u963b\u788d\u8de8\u8303\u5f0f\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u5f02\u6784\u5185\u5b58\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMemAdapter\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u4ece\u7edf\u4e00\u5185\u5b58\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1bMemAdapter\u5728\u5355GPU\u4e0a13\u5206\u949f\u5b8c\u6210\u8de8\u8303\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u4e0d\u52305%\uff1b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u878d\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "MemAdapter\u5177\u6709\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address the fundamental tension between batch decoding and expert sparsity, we present SERE, a Similarity-based Expert Re-routing method for Efficient batch decoding in MoE models. SERE dynamically reduces the number of active experts in an input-aware manner by re-routing tokens from secondary experts to their most similar primary counterparts. It also leverages similarity patterns to identify and preserve critical experts, thereby preventing capability loss. Notably, SERE avoids static expert pruning or merging, instead enabling dynamic expert skipping based on batch-level expert redundancy. Additionally, we provide an efficient custom CUDA kernel for SERE, enabling plug-and-play use in vLLM with only a single-line code change. Extensive experiments on various complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SERE achieves up to 2.0x speedup with minimal quality loss, providing a practical solution for cost-efficient and latency-sensitive large-scale MoE deployment.

Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines.

We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u53d8\u6210\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cfIP\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u6a21\u4eff\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAGENTWM\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4IP\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u53d8\u6210\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u6a21\u4eff\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8be5\u573a\u666f\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u4fdd\u62a4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAGENTWM\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u5fae\u504f\u7f6e\u529f\u80fd\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u5e03\u6ce8\u5165\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u751f\u6210\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cAGENTWM\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "AGENTWM\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u5bf9\u624b\u79fb\u9664\u6c34\u5370\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u88ab\u76d7\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we propose Personalized Agent Security Bench (PASB), an end-to-end security evaluation framework tailored for real-world personalized agents. Building upon existing agent attack paradigms, PASB incorporates personalized usage scenarios, realistic toolchains, and long-horizon interactions, enabling black-box, end-to-end security evaluation on real systems. Using OpenClaw as a representative case study, we systematically evaluate its security across multiple personalized scenarios, tool capabilities, and attack types. Our results indicate that OpenClaw exhibits critical vulnerabilities at different execution stages, including user prompt processing, tool usage, and memory retrieval, highlighting substantial security risks in personalized agent deployments.

But is adaptation the right strategy? We study compute-optimal test-time strategies for verifiable execution-grounded (VEG) tasks, domains like GPU kernel optimization where a deterministic evaluator provides dense, continuous reward signals. Using KernelBench as our testbed and a 120B-parameter model (GPT-OSS-120B with LoRA adaptation), we find that search outperforms minimal adaptation (1-5 gradient steps): Best-of-N sampling achieves 90% task success (18/20 tasks) at K=64 across the full KernelBench L1 eval set while TTT's best checkpoint reaches only 30.6% (3-seed mean), with TTT's \"equivalent K\" falling below 1, worse than single-sample inference. The failure mode is over-sharpening: gradient updates collapse diversity toward mediocre solutions rather than discovering optimal ones. Our main contribution is surprisal-guided selection: selecting the highest-surprisal (lowest-confidence) correct sample yields 80% success vs. 50% for most-confident selection, a 30% improvement. Extending to surprisal-guided-top3 matches oracle performance at 100%. This zero-cost strategy, validated through length-controlled analysis, recovers oracle performance. For dense-reward VEG tasks, compute should be allocated to sample diversity and intelligent selection rather than gradient adaptation.

This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy.

Existing methods often fail to address distribution shift across clients and distribution drift over time, or they rely on unrealistic assumptions such as known number of client clusters and data heterogeneity types, which limits their generalizability. We introduce Feroma, a novel FL framework that explicitly handles both distribution shift and drift without relying on client or cluster identity. Feroma builds on client distribution profiles-compact, privacy-preserving representations of local data-that guide model aggregation and test-time model assignment through adaptive similarity-based weighting. This design allows Feroma to dynamically select aggregation strategies during training, ranging from clustered to personalized, and deploy suitable models to unseen, and unlabeled test clients without retraining, online adaptation, or prior knowledge on clients' data. Extensive experiments show that compared to 10 state-of-the-art methods, Feroma improves performance and stability under dynamic data heterogeneity conditions-an average accuracy gain of up to 12 percentage points over the best baselines across 6 benchmarks-while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg.

Algorithmic recourse provides actionable input modifications to achieve more favorable outcomes, typically relying on counterfactual explanations to suggest such changes. However, when the Rashomon set - the set of near-optimal models - is large, standard counterfactual explanations can become unreliable, as a recourse action valid for one model may fail under another. We introduce ElliCE, a novel framework for robust algorithmic recourse that optimizes counterfactuals over an ellipsoidal approximation of the Rashomon set. The resulting explanations are provably valid over this ellipsoid, with theoretical guarantees on uniqueness, stability, and alignment with key feature directions. Empirically, ElliCE generates counterfactuals that are not only more robust but also more flexible, adapting to user-specified feature constraints while being substantially faster than existing baselines.

To propose a stability-preserving way to inject spectral capacity into existing MLP/FFN layers under fixed parameter and training budgets, we introduce Spectral Gating Networks (SGN), a drop-in spectral reparameterization.

A hybrid GELU-Fourier formulation further improves optimization robustness while enhancing high-frequency fidelity. Across vision, NLP, audio, and PDE benchmarks, SGN consistently improves accuracy-efficiency trade-offs under comparable computational budgets, achieving 93.15% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and up to 11.7x faster inference than spline-based KAN variants.

Specifically, it remains unclear why multi-agent collaboration outperforms single-agent reasoning and which design choices contribute most to these gains, making it difficult to build better systems.\n  We address this gap by introducing a unified theoretical framework that decomposes multi-agent reasoning gains into three conceptually independent dimensions: Exploration for diverse solution coverage, Information for high-fidelity feedback, and Aggregation for principled consensus. Through this lens, existing methods can be understood as special cases that optimize only subsets of these dimensions. Building upon this decomposition, a novel framework called PRISM (Propose-Review-Integrate Synthesis for Multi-agent Reasoning) is proposed, which jointly maximizes all three dimensions through role-based diversity, execution-grounded feedback with evidence-based cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis with closed-loop validation. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and function calling benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior compute-efficiency compared to methods optimizing partial dimensions.

While effective for individual prediction problems, this paradigm underutilizes the rich structure of clinical data and limits the transferability, stability, and interpretability of learned features. In this work, we propose dense feature learning, a representation centric framework that explicitly shapes the linear structure of medical embeddings. Our approach operates directly on embedding matrices, encouraging spectral balance, subspace consistency, and feature orthogonality through objectives defined entirely in terms of linear algebraic properties. Without relying on labels or generative reconstruction, dense feature learning produces representations with higher effective rank, improved conditioning, and greater stability across time. Empirical evaluations across longitudinal EHR data, clinical text, and multimodal patient representations demonstrate consistent improvements in downstream linear performance, robustness, and subspace alignment compared to supervised and self supervised baselines.

While recent years have seen an increasing development of explainability methods, current evaluation metrics (e.g., fidelity, sparsity) often fail to assess whether an explanation identifies the true underlying causal variables. To address this, we propose the Explanation-Generalization Score (EGS), a metric that quantifies the causal relevance of GNN explanations. EGS is founded on the principle of feature invariance and posits that if an explanation captures true causal drivers, it should lead to stable predictions across distribution shifts. To quantify this, we introduce a framework that trains GNNs using explanatory subgraphs and evaluates their performance in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) settings (here, OOD generalization serves as a rigorous proxy for the explanation's causal validity). Through large-scale validation involving 11,200 model combinations across synthetic and real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that EGS provides a principled benchmark for ranking explainers based on their ability to capture causal substructures, offering a robust alternative to traditional fidelity-based metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e8b\u540e\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6307\u6807EGS\uff0c\u7ecf\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cEGS\u80fd\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u6392\u540d\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5426\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684Explanation - Generalization Score\uff08EGS\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3GNN\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf911200\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cEGS\u80fd\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6355\u83b7\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u540d\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "EGS\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem. Instead of relying on heuristic trial-and-error exploration, OSCAR employs a novel offline-online paradigm. In the offline phase, we model CIR via atomic retrieval selection and composition as a two-stage mixed-integer programming problem, mathematically deriving optimal trajectories that maximize ground-truth coverage for training samples via rigorous boolean set operations. These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time.

Empirical scaling laws are widely used to predict loss as model size and training data grow, however, almost all existing studies fix the optimizer (typically AdamW). At the same time, a new generation of optimizers (e.g., Muon, Shampoo, SOAP) promises faster and more stable convergence, but their relationship with model and data scaling is not yet well understood. In this work, we study scaling laws across different optimizers.

Previous work has established what problems debate can solve in principle, but has not analysed the practical cost of human oversight: how many queries must the judge make to the debate transcript? We introduce Debate Query Complexity}(DQC), the minimum number of bits a verifier must inspect to correctly decide a debate.\n  Surprisingly, we find that PSPACE/poly (the class of problems which debate can efficiently decide) is precisely the class of functions decidable with O(log n) queries. This characterisation shows that debate is remarkably query-efficient: even for highly complex problems, logarithmic oversight suffices. We also establish that functions depending on all their input bits require Omega(log n) queries, and that any function computable by a circuit of size s satisfies DQC(f) <= log(s) + 3.

Recently, zero-shot diffusion based methods have been proposed for such inverse problems, offering a posterior sampling based solution that leverages prior knowledge. Such algorithms incorporate the observations through inference, often leaning on manual tuning and heuristics. In this work we propose a rigorous analysis of such approximate posterior-samplers, relying on a Gaussianity assumption of the prior. Under this regime, we show that both the ideal posterior sampler and diffusion-based reconstruction algorithms can be expressed in closed-form, enabling their thorough analysis and comparisons in the spectral domain. Building on these representations, we also introduce a principled framework for parameter design, replacing heuristic selection strategies used to date. The proposed approach is method-agnostic and yields tailored parameter choices for each algorithm, jointly accounting for the characteristics of the prior, the degraded signal, and the diffusion dynamics. We show that our spectral recommendations differ structurally from standard heuristics and vary with the diffusion step size, resulting in a consistent balance between perceptual quality and signal fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6269\u6563\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u9a8c\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7ed9\u51fa\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6269\u6563\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u53c2\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bf9\u7406\u60f3\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u548c\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u8c31\u5efa\u8bae\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u957f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While regulatory and policy frameworks tend to define trust in normative terms, the trust users place in chatbots often emerges from behavioral mechanisms.

Based on this observation, we propose reframing chatbots not as companions or assistants, but as highly skilled salespeople whose objectives are determined by the deploying organization.

However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity.

Despite recent advances, the scalability of existing POMDP solvers remains limited. Moreover, many settings require a policy that is robust across multiple POMDPs, further aggravating the scalability issue. We propose the Lexpop framework for POMDP solving. Lexpop (1) employs deep reinforcement learning to train a neural policy, represented by a recurrent neural network, and (2) constructs a finite-state controller mimicking the neural policy through efficient extraction methods. Crucially, unlike neural policies, such controllers can be formally evaluated, providing performance guarantees. We extend Lexpop to compute robust policies for hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs), which describe finite sets of POMDPs. We associate every extracted controller with its worst-case POMDP. Using a set of such POMDPs, we iteratively train a robust neural policy and consequently extract a robust controller.

We close with directions for future work to assess the potential for and consequences of belief offloading in human-AI interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u4eec\u4ece\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u5f62\u6210\u4fe1\u5ff5\u65f6\u7684\u2018\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5378\u8f7d\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u89c4\u8303\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u660e\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4eba\u4eec\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u601d\u60f3\u4f19\u4f34\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5378\u8f7d\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u8ba4\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4eba\u7c7b - \u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u2018\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5378\u8f7d\u2019\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u54f2\u5b66\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5378\u8f7d\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5378\u8f7d\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u5176\u89c4\u8303\u542b\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b - \u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5378\u8f7d\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u53ca\u540e\u679c\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this paper, we view latent chain-of-thought as a manipulable causal process in representation space by modeling latent steps as variables in a structural causal model (SCM) and analyzing their effects through step-wise $\\mathrm{do}$-interventions. We study two representative paradigms (i.e., Coconut and CODI) on both mathematical and general reasoning tasks to investigate three key questions: (1) which steps are causally necessary for correctness and when answers become decidable early; (2) how does influence propagate across steps, and how does this structure compare to explicit CoT; and (3) do intermediate trajectories retain competing answer modes, and how does output-level commitment differ from representational commitment across steps. We find that latent-step budgets behave less like homogeneous extra depth and more like staged functionality with non-local routing, and we identify a persistent gap between early output bias and late representational commitment.

Current deep learning approaches to structure-based drug design rely on expensive all-atom diffusion to generate 3D coordinates, creating inference bottlenecks that render large-scale compound screening computationally intractable. We challenge this paradigm with a critical hypothesis: full all-atom resolution is unnecessary for accurate small molecule pose and binding affinity prediction. TerraBind tests this hypothesis through a coarse pocket-level representation (protein C$_\u03b2$ atoms and ligand heavy atoms only) within a multimodal architecture combining COATI-3 molecular encodings and ESM-2 protein embeddings that learns rich structural representations, which are used in a diffusion-free optimization module for pose generation and a binding affinity likelihood prediction module. On structure prediction benchmarks (FoldBench, PoseBusters, Runs N' Poses), TerraBind matches diffusion-based baselines in ligand pose accuracy. Crucially, TerraBind outperforms Boltz-2 by $\\sim$20\\% in Pearson correlation for binding affinity prediction on both a public benchmark (CASP16) and a diverse proprietary dataset (18 biochemical/cell assays). We show that the affinity prediction module also provides well-calibrated affinity uncertainty estimates, addressing a critical gap in reliable compound prioritization for drug discovery. Furthermore, this module enables a continual learning framework and a hedged batch selection strategy that, in simulated drug discovery cycles, achieves 6$\\times$ greater affinity improvement of selected molecules over greedy-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u86cb\u767d\u8d28 - \u914d\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bTerraBind\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5feb26\u500d\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea620%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u6269\u6563\u751f\u62103D\u5750\u6807\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u6784\u8c61\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u53e3\u888b\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408COATI - 3\u5206\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u548cESM - 2\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6269\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u6784\u8c61\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u4f3c\u7136\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u914d\u4f53\u6784\u8c61\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6bd4Boltz - 2\u9ad8\u7ea620%\uff1b\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u9009\u5206\u5b50\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad86\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "TerraBind\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28 - \u914d\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u9760\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4f18\u5148\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While diffusion models (DM) have recently gained attention for their ability to capture complex predictive distributions, two gaps remain: (i) the generative path is conditioned only on positive evidence, overlooking informative negative context, and (ii) training objectives are dominated by cross-entropy ranking, which improves candidate ordering but provides little supervision over the calibration of the denoised embedding. To bridge this gap, we introduce Negative-Aware Diffusion model for TKG Extrapolation (NADEx). Specifically, NADEx encodes subject-centric histories of entities, relations and temporal intervals into sequential embeddings. NADEx perturbs the query object in the forward process and reconstructs it in reverse with a Transformer denoiser conditioned on the temporal-relational context.

This requires operationalization of values, which can be prone to misspecification. The social nature of values demands their representation to adhere to multiple users while value systems are diverse, yet exhibit patterns among groups. In sequential decision making, efforts have been made towards personalization for different goals or values from demonstrations of diverse agents. However, these approaches demand manually designed features or lack value-based interpretability and/or adaptability to diverse user preferences.\n  We propose algorithms for learning models of value alignment and value systems for a society of agents in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), based on clustering and preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (PbMORL).

With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), state-of-the-art performance in tabular anomaly detection has been achieved by converting tabular data into text and fine-tuning LLMs. However, these methods randomly order columns during conversion, without considering the causal relationships between them, which is crucial for accurately detecting anomalies. In this paper, we present CausalTaD, a method that injects causal knowledge into LLMs for tabular anomaly detection. We first identify the causal relationships between columns and reorder them to align with these causal relationships. This reordering can be modeled as a linear ordering problem. Since each column contributes differently to the causal relationships, we further propose a reweighting strategy to assign different weights to different columns to enhance this effect.

We introduce CausalT5K, a diagnostic benchmark of over 5,000 cases across 10 domains that tests three critical capabilities: (1) detecting rung collapse, where models answer interventional queries with associational evidence; (2) resisting sycophantic drift under adversarial pressure; and (3) generating Wise Refusals that specify missing information when evidence is underdetermined. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, CausalT5K embeds causal traps in realistic narratives and decomposes performance into Utility (sensitivity) and Safety (specificity), revealing failure modes invisible to aggregate accuracy. Developed through a rigorous human-machine collaborative pipeline involving 40 domain experts, iterative cross-validation cycles, and composite verification via rule-based, LLM, and human scoring, CausalT5K implements Pearl's Ladder of Causation as research infrastructure. Preliminary experiments reveal a Four-Quadrant Control Landscape where static audit policies universally fail, a finding that demonstrates CausalT5K's value for advancing trustworthy reasoning systems.

The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines.

In LLM reasoning, existing works also explore various solutions for learning effective process reward models (PRM) with or without the help of an expert policy. However, existing methods either rely on strong assumptions about the expert policies (e.g., requiring their reward functions) or suffer intrinsic limitations (e.g., entropy collapse), resulting in weak PRMs or limited generalizability. In this paper, we introduce rePIRL, an inverse RL-inspired framework that learns effective PRMs with minimal assumptions about expert policies. Specifically, we design a dual learning process that updates the policy and the PRM interchangeably. Our learning algorithm has customized techniques to address the challenges of scaling traditional inverse RL to LLMs. We theoretically show that our proposed learning framework can unify both online and offline PRM learning methods, justifying that rePIRL can learn PRMs with minimal assumptions. Empirical evaluations on standardized math and coding reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of rePIRL over existing methods. We further show the application of our trained PRM in test-time training, test-time scaling, and providing an early signal for training hard problems.

Multi-agent collaboration offers a promising avenue to transcend these boundaries. However, existing frameworks typically rely on prompt-based test-time interactions or multi-role configurations trained with homogeneous parameters, limiting error correction capabilities and strategic diversity. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforced Training and Inference Framework with Self-Search Scaling (MARTI-MARS2), which integrates policy learning with multi-agent tree search by formulating the multi-agent collaborative exploration process as a dynamic and learnable environment. By allowing agents to iteratively explore and refine within the environment, the framework facilitates evolution from parameter-sharing homogeneous multi-role training to heterogeneous multi-agent training, breaking through single-agent capability limits. We also introduce an efficient inference strategy MARTI-MARS2-T+ to fully exploit the scaling potential of multi-agent collaboration at test time. We conduct extensive experiments across varied model scales (8B, 14B, and 32B) on challenging code generation benchmarks.

Such loads are characterized by fast workload-driven variability and protection-driven disconnection and reconnection behavior that are not captured by conventional load models. Existing data center load modeling includes physics-based approaches, which provide interpretable structure for grid simulation, and data-driven approaches, which capture empirical workload variability from data. However, physics-based models are typically uncalibrated to facility-level operation, while trajectory alignment in data-driven methods often leads to overfitting and unrealistic dynamic behavior. To resolve these limitations, we design the framework to leverage both physics-based structure and data-driven adaptability. The physics-based structure is parameterized to enable data-driven pattern-consistent calibration from real operational data, supporting facility-level grid planning. We further show that trajectory-level alignment is limited for inherently stochastic data center loads. Therefore, we design the calibration to align temporal and statistical patterns using temporal contrastive learning (TCL). This calibration is performed locally at the facility, and only calibrated parameters are shared with utilities, preserving data privacy. The proposed load model is calibrated by real-world operational load data from the MIT Supercloud, ASU Sol, Blue Waters, and ASHRAE datasets. Then it is integrated into the ANDES platform and evaluated on the IEEE 39-bus, NPCC 140-bus, and WECC 179-bus systems. We find that interactions among LELs can fundamentally alter post-disturbance recovery behavior, producing compound disconnection-reconnection dynamics and delayed stabilization that are not captured by uncalibrated load models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5927\u7535\u5b50\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ecf\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6821\u51c6\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6bcd\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u672a\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5982\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u9488\u5bf9\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e00\u81f4\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u6821\u51c6\u53c2\u6570\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6821\u51c6\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230ANDES\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6bcd\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u7535\u5b50\u8d1f\u8f7d\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u6270\u52a8\u540e\u6062\u590d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u672a\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u7535\u5b50\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5728\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for aligning these models with task-specific rewards, improving overall quality and reliability. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an efficient, value-function-free alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that leverages group-relative reward normalization. We introduce Iterative Group Relative Policy Optimization (iGRPO), a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds dynamic self-conditioning through model-generated drafts. In Stage 1, iGRPO samples multiple exploratory drafts and selects the highest-reward draft using the same scalar reward signal used for optimization. In Stage 2, it appends this best draft to the original prompt and applies a GRPO-style update on draft-conditioned refinements, training the policy to improve beyond its strongest prior attempt. Under matched rollout budgets, iGRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across base models (e.g., Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled), validating its effectiveness on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, applying iGRPO to OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math achieves new state-of-the-art results of 85.62\\% and 79.64\\% on AIME24 and AIME25, respectively.

However, realizing such soft policies in practice remains challenging. Existing approaches either depend on parametric policies with limited expressivity or employ diffusion-based policies whose intractable likelihoods hinder reliable entropy estimation in soft policy objectives. We address this challenge by directly realizing soft-policy sampling via Langevin dynamics driven by the action gradient of the Q-function. This perspective leads to Langevin Q-Learning (LQL), which samples actions from the target Boltzmann distribution without explicitly parameterizing the policy. However, directly applying Langevin dynamics suffers from slow mixing in high-dimensional and non-convex Q-landscapes, limiting its practical effectiveness.

NC-LQL learns a noise-conditioned Q-function that induces a sequence of progressively smoothed value landscapes, enabling sampling to transition from global exploration to precise mode refinement.

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u9047\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e - \u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u7406\u5ff5\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u6e90\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u5355\u5411\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u5165\u6570\u636e - \u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u65b0\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4eceL0\u5230L4\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6309\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u914d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5efa\u8bbe\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Existing methods rely on training-time strategies that do not generalise to unseen constraints during inference, and struggle to handle conditional tasks beyond tabular imputation. While manifold theory offers a principled way to guide generation, current formulations are tied to specific inference-time objectives and are limited to continuous domains. We extend manifold theory to tabular data and expand its scope to handle diverse inference-time objectives. On this foundation, we introduce HARPOON, a tabular diffusion method that guides unconstrained samples along the manifold geometry to satisfy diverse tabular conditions at inference. We validate our theoretical contributions empirically on tasks such as imputation and enforcing inequality constraints, demonstrating HARPOON'S strong performance across diverse datasets and the practical benefits of manifold-aware guidance for tabular data.

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored.

GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks.

There remain a large number of important unsolved problems in this area such as product prediction given reactants, drug discovery, and metric-optimized molecule synthesis, but efforts to solve these problems using machine learning have also increased in recent years. In this work, we propose the use of attention to study functional groups and other property-impacting molecular substructures from a data-driven perspective, using a transformer-based model (BERT) on datasets of string representations of molecules and analyzing the behavior of its attention heads. We then apply the representations of functional groups and atoms learned by the model to tackle problems of toxicity, solubility, drug-likeness, and synthesis accessibility on smaller datasets using the learned representations as features for graph convolution and attention models on the graph structure of molecules, as well as fine-tuning of BERT. Finally, we propose the use of attention visualization as a helpful tool for chemistry practitioners and students to quickly identify important substructures in various chemical properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u5b98\u80fd\u56e2\u7b49\u5206\u5b50\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5316\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8f85\u52a9\u5316\u5b66\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u673a\u5316\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u501f\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08BERT\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5b50\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9BERT\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5b98\u80fd\u56e2\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u8868\u5f81\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6bd2\u6027\u3001\u6eb6\u89e3\u5ea6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5316\u5b66\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Existing anti-exploration methods count continuous state-action pairs by discretizing these data, but often suffer from the issues of dimension disaster and information loss in the discretization process, leading to efficiency and performance reduction, and even failure of policy learning. In this paper, a novel anti-exploration method based on Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) and fuzzy clustering in offline RL is proposed. We first propose an efficient pseudo-count method based on the multi-codebook VQVAE to discretize state-action pairs, and design an offline RL anti-exploitation method based on the proposed pseudo-count method to handle the dimension disaster issue and improve the learning efficiency. In addition, a codebook update mechanism based on fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering is developed to improve the use rate of vectors in codebooks, addressing the information loss issue in the discretization process.

Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases.

We argue that this tax primarily arises from continual-learning-style forgetting in sequential alignment, where distribution shift and conflicting objectives cause safety updates to overwrite pre-trained competencies. Accordingly, we cast safety alignment as a continual learning (CL) problem that must balance plasticity (acquiring safety constraints) and stability (preserving general abilities). We propose Orthogonal Gradient Projection for Safety Alignment (OGPSA), a lightweight method that mitigates interference by constraining each safety update to be orthogonal (in a first-order sense) to a learned subspace capturing general capabilities. Specifically, OGPSA estimates a low-rank capability subspace from gradients on a small reference set and projects the safety gradient onto its orthogonal complement before updating. This produces safety-directed updates that minimally perturb prior knowledge while retaining capacity for alignment. OGPSA is plug-and-play and integrates into standard post-training pipelines without large-scale replay, auxiliary objectives, or retraining. Across Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and sequential SFT$\\rightarrow$DPO settings, OGPSA consistently improves the safety--utility Pareto frontier over standard baselines. For instance, on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct under SFT$\\rightarrow$DPO, OGPSA preserves strong safety while recovering general capability, improving SimpleQA from 0.53\\% to 3.03\\% and IFEval from 51.94\\% to 63.96\\%.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning, their potential for coordinated control has not been fully explored. Inspired by human teamwork, we present CLiMRS (Cooperative Large-Language-Model-Driven Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System), an adaptive group negotiation framework among LLMs for multi-robot collaboration. This framework pairs each robot with an LLM agent and dynamically forms subgroups through a general proposal planner. Within each subgroup, a subgroup manager leads perception-driven multi-LLM discussions to get commands for actions. Feedback is provided by both robot execution outcomes and environment changes. This grouping-planning-execution-feedback loop enables efficient planning and robust execution. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CLiMBench, a heterogeneous multi-robot benchmark of challenging assembly tasks.

At each iteration, LMABO uses a structured state representation to prompt the LLM to select the most suitable acquisition function from a diverse portfolio. In an evaluation across 50 benchmark problems, LMABO demonstrates a significant performance improvement over strong static, adaptive portfolio, and other LLM-based baselines.

Departing from data-intensive finetuning, we investigate the paradigm of Inference-time Language Acquisition (ILA), where an LLM masters an unfamiliar language through dynamic interaction with limited external resources. In this paper, we propose ILA-agent, a general ILA framework that equips LLMs with a set of behavioral primitives. By modeling essential human-like behaviors as a suite of tools, ILA-agent enables LLMs to incrementally explore, apply, and verify language knowledge through structured interactions with the official documentation and execution environment. To provide a rigorous evaluation in a low-resource setting, we construct Cangjie-bench, a multi-task benchmark based on the novel statically-typed language Cangjie.

Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce Kinetic Path Energy (KPE), an action-like, per-sample diagnostic that measures the accumulated kinetic effort along an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. Empirically, KPE exhibits two robust correspondences: (i) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic fidelity; (ii) high-KPE trajectories terminate on low-density manifold frontiers. We further provide theoretical guarantees linking trajectory energy to data density. Paradoxically, this correlation is non-monotonic. At sufficiently high energy, generation can degenerate into memorization. Leveraging the closed-form of empirical flow matching, we show that extreme energies drive trajectories toward near-copies of training examples.

This study investigates the effectiveness of attention-based deep learning models for early PD detection using tabular biomedical data.

TabNet and MLP demonstrated competitive performance, while Gradient Boosting yielded the lowest overall scores.

In particular, frequency sharing between the HAPS satellite uplink and HAPS ground downlink improves spectrum efficiency but suffers from interference caused by the HAPS antenna back-lobe.

This selection occurs through the progressive elimination of degrees of freedom that would otherwise enable structural reconfiguration. We refer to this phenomenon as \\emph{critical period closure}: beyond a certain stage of learning, transitions between compatible representations become dynamically inaccessible under any finite dissipation budget.\n  As a result, continual learning failure arises not from the absence of solutions satisfying multiple tasks, but from an irreversible loss of representational freedom induced by prior learning. This reframes catastrophic forgetting as a dynamical constraint imposed by finite-time dissipation, rather than direct task interference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9\u5c42\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u6b64\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u5bf9\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u9009\u62e9\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u5f81\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u5bf9\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u8f68\u8ff9\u5c42\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u5bf9\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u9650\u8017\u6563\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u8fbe\u89e3\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u5f81\u81ea\u7531\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u81ea\u7531\u4e27\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u662f\u7531\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u8017\u6563\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u3002"}}

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then utilized as the final classification layer to optimize decision boundaries.

Consequently, this multi-task scenario requires addressing critical questions: which tasks are similar, and how and why do they exhibit similarity? In this work, we propose a multi-task similarity measure based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves.\n  ALE curves are compared using the Fr\u00e9chet distance, weighted by the data distribution, and the resulting similarity measure incorporates the importance of each feature. The measure is applicable in both single-task learning scenarios, where each task is trained separately, and multi-task learning scenarios, where all tasks are learned simultaneously. The measure is model-agnostic, allowing the use of different machine learning models across tasks. A scaling factor is introduced to account for differences in predictive performance across tasks, and several recommendations are provided for applying the measure in complex scenarios.\n  We validate this measure using four datasets, one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets. The real-world datasets include a well-known Parkinson's dataset and a bike-sharing usage dataset -- both structured in tabular format -- as well as the CelebA dataset, which is used to evaluate the application of concept bottleneck encoders in a multitask learning setting. The results demonstrate that the measure aligns with intuitive expectations of task similarity across both tabular and non-tabular data, making it a valuable tool for exploring relationships between tasks and supporting informed decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eXAI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u7cfb\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u54ea\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u3001\u4e3a\u4f55\u76f8\u4f3c\u3001\u5982\u4f55\u8861\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u7b49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eALE\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Fr\u00e9chet\u8ddd\u79bb\u6bd4\u8f83ALE\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u878d\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u975e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u90fd\u7b26\u5408\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u9884\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Existing fairness assessments are typically conducted by AI experts or regulators using predefined protected attributes and metrics, which often fail to capture the diversity and nuance of fairness notions held by the individuals who are affected by these systems' decisions, such as decision subjects. Recent work has therefore called for involving affected individuals in fairness assessment, yet little empirical evidence exists on how they create their own fairness criteria or what kinds of criteria they produce - knowledge that could not only inform experts' fairness evaluation and mitigation, but also guide the design of AI assessment tools. We address this gap through a qualitative user study with 18 participants in a credit rating scenario. Participants first articulated their fairness notions in their own words. Then, participants turned them into concrete quantified and operationalized fairness criteria, through an interactive prototype we designed. Our findings provide empirical evidence of the process through which people's fairness notions emerge via grounding in model features, and uncover a diverse set of individuals' custom-defined criteria for both outcome and procedural fairness.

Learning in this setting proceeds by first computing (a subset of) the possible combinations of labels that satisfy the formula and then computing a loss using those combinations and the classifiers' scores. One challenge is that the space of label combinations can grow exponentially, making learning difficult. We propose a technique that prunes this space by exploiting the intuition that instances with similar latent representations are likely to share the same label. While this intuition has been widely used in weakly supervised learning, its application in our setting is challenging due to label dependencies imposed by logical constraints. We formulate the pruning process as an integer linear program that discards inconsistent label combinations while respecting logical structure. Our approach, CLIPPER, is orthogonal to existing training algorithms and can be seamlessly integrated with them.

Its beneficial effects are: not only the old view of language and education, especially the old view of teaching Chinese as a foreign language, but also the old view of human-computer interaction. Its significance lies in that a series of great cross-border Rongzhixue such as language, knowledge, education and teaching, as well as new methods and new topics of bilingual thinking training are clearly put forward from the perspective of integrating wisdom. Especially in the face of the challenge of Chat GPT to human learning ability and even creativity, the existing concepts of language knowledge education and teaching are already very backward.

This works in static regimes but breaks under distributional shift, task permutation, and continual learning, where even mild topological changes can invalidate learned solutions and trigger catastrophic forgetting. We propose Metric-Topology Factorization (MTF) as a unifying geometric principle: intelligence is not navigation through a fixed maze, but the ability to reshape representational geometry so desired behaviors become stable attractors. Learning corresponds to metric contraction (a controlled deformation of Riemannian structure), while task identity and environmental variation are encoded topologically and stored separately in memory. We show any fixed metric is geometrically incomplete: for any local metric representation, some topological transformations make it singular or incoherent, implying an unavoidable stability-plasticity tradeoff for weight-based systems. MTF resolves this by factorizing stable topology from plastic metric warps, enabling rapid adaptation via geometric switching rather than re-optimization. Building on this, we introduce the Topological Urysohn Machine (TUM), implementing MTF through memory-amortized metric inference (MAMI): spectral task signatures index amortized metric transformations, letting a single learned geometry be reused across permuted, reflected, or parity-altered environments. This explains robustness to task reordering, resistance to catastrophic forgetting, and generalization across transformations that defeat conventional continual learning methods (e.g., EWC).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMetric - Topology Factorization (MTF)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Topological Urysohn Machine (TUM)\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7f6e\u6362\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMTF\uff0c\u5c06\u7a33\u5b9a\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u53d8\u5f62\u5206\u79bb\uff1b\u5f15\u5165TUM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5b58\u644a\u9500\u5ea6\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\uff08MAMI\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0MTF\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0cMTF\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5207\u6362\u800c\u975e\u91cd\u65b0\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "TUM\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6297\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u51fb\u8d25\u4f20\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

SurfAge-Net establishes a new modeling paradigm by incorporating the connectomic principles of cortical organization: it explicitly models both intra- and inter-hemispheric dependencies through a spatial-channel mixing and a lateralization-aware attention mechanism, enabling the network to characterize the coordinate maturation pattern uniquely associated with each target region. Validated on three fetal and neonatal datasets, SurfAge-Net outperforms existing approaches (global MAE = 0.54, regional MAE = 0.45 in gestational/postmenstrual weeks) and demonstrates strong generalizability across external cohorts. Importantly, it provides spatially precise and biologically interpretable maps of cortical maturation, effectively identifying heterogeneous delays and regional-specific abnormalities in atypical developmental populations.

To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (H-JEPA) for scalable predictive control. Instead of transmitting states, device observations are encoded into low-dimensional embeddings that preserve essential dynamics. The proposed architecture employs a three-level hierarchical prediction, with high-level, medium-level, and low-level predictors operating across different temporal resolutions, to achieve long-term prediction stability, intermediate interpolation, and fine-grained refinement, respectively.

Orthogonally, projection-based low-rank optimizers were mainly designed for memory efficiency, but remain suboptimal for communication-limited training: one-sided synchronization still transmits an $O(rn)$ object for an $m\\times n$ matrix gradient and refresh steps can dominate peak communicated bytes. We propose TSR, which brings two-sided low-rank communication to Adam-family updates (TSR-Adam) by synchronizing a compact core $U^\\top G V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times r}$, reducing the dominant per-step payload from $O(mn)$ to $O(r^2)$ while keeping moment states in low-dimensional cores. To further reduce the peak communication from subspace refresh, TSR-Adam adopts a randomized SVD-based refresh that avoids full-gradient synchronization. We additionally extend low-rank communication to embedding gradients with embedding-specific ranks and refresh schedules, yielding additional communication and memory savings over keeping embeddings dense. Across pretraining from 60M to 1B model scales, TSR-Adam reduces average communicated bytes per step by $13\\times$, and on GLUE fine-tuning it reduces communication by $25\\times$, while achieving comparable performance; we further provide a theoretical stationarity analysis for the proposed update.

Our formulation renders possible to express a rich family of operators over generative models densities, including intersection (e.g., to enforce safety), union (e.g., to compose diverse models), interpolation (e.g., for discovery), their reward-guided counterparts, as well as complex logical expressions via generative circuits. Next, we introduce Reward-Guided Flow Merging (RFM), a mirror-descent scheme that reduces reward-guided flow merging to a sequence of standard fine-tuning problems. Then, we provide first-of-their-kind theoretical guarantees for reward-guided and pure flow merging via RFM.

As an important branch of large language model(LLM), MoE model only activate a subset of experts based on a routing network. This sparse conditional computation mechanism significantly improves computational efficiency, paving a promising path for greater scalability and cost-efficiency. It not only enhance downstream applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal in various horizontal domains, but also exhibit broad applicability across vertical domains.

Subsequently, we extend beyond the centralized paradigm to the decentralized paradigm, which unlocks the immense untapped potential of decentralized infrastructure, enables democratization of MoE development for broader communities, and delivers greater scalability and cost-efficiency. Furthermore we focus on exploring its vertical domain applications. Finally, we also identify key challenges and promising future research directions.

This accessibility creates an opportunity to study how quantitative retinal phenotypes relate to ocular and systemic diseases.

We present RetSAM, a general retinal segmentation and quantification framework for fundus imaging. It delivers robust multi-target segmentation and standardized biomarker extraction, supporting downstream ophthalmologic studies and oculomics correlation analyses. Trained on over 200,000 fundus images, RetSAM supports three task categories and segments five anatomical structures, four retinal phenotypic patterns, and more than 20 distinct lesion types. It converts these segmentation results into over 30 standardized biomarkers that capture structural morphology, vascular geometry, and degenerative changes. Trained with a multi-stage strategy using both private and public fundus data, RetSAM achieves superior segmentation performance on 17 public datasets. It improves on prior best methods by 3.9 percentage points in DSC on average, with up to 15 percentage points on challenging multi-task benchmarks, and generalizes well across diverse populations, imaging devices, and clinical settings. The resulting biomarkers enable systematic correlation analyses across major ophthalmic diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and pathologic myopia.

Most interestingly, we identify a realistic setting where combining comparisons and ratings outperforms using either one alone, and when the accurate ordering of top entities is critical. Given the de facto availability of signals of multiple forms, SCoRa additionally offers a versatile foundation for preference learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u504f\u597d\u83b7\u53d6\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7edf\u4e00\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578bSCoRa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u4f53\u65f6\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u4e2a\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd8\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e89\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578bSCoRa\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u4ece\u4e24\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "SCoRa\u7684MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9274\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0cSCoRa\u4e3a\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, despite the superior performance of transformer-based models over convolutional architectures, their limited interpretability remains a major obstacle to clinical trust and deployment. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including gradient-based saliency methods and perturbation-based approaches, are often computationally expensive, require numerous forward passes, and frequently produce noisy or anatomically irrelevant explanations. To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments conducted on the FLARE22 and CHAOS datasets demonstrate that XAI-CLIP achieves up to a 60\\% reduction in runtime, a 44.6\\% improvement in dice score, and a 96.7\\% increase in Intersection-over-Union for occlusion-based explanations compared to conventional perturbation methods. Qualitative results further confirm cleaner and more anatomically consistent attribution maps with fewer artifacts, highlighting that the incorporation of multimodal vision-language representations into perturbation-based XAI frameworks significantly enhances both interpretability and efficiency, thereby enabling transparent and clinically deployable medical image segmentation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faXAI - CLIP\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709XAI\u6280\u672f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faXAI - CLIP\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u91ca\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728FLARE22\u548cCHAOS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cXAI - CLIP\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1160%\uff0c\u9ab0\u5b50\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u9ad844.6%\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u906e\u6321\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4ea4\u5e76\u6bd4\u589e\u52a096.7%\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u878d\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6270\u52a8\u7684XAI\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, current methods often depend on replay-based strategies, which raise concerns like memory limits and privacy issues, while also struggling to resolve the stability-plasticity dilemma. In this paper, we suggest that lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively guide the reasoning process of a fixed GNN backbone. Based on this idea, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation (TAAM). The key component of TAAM is its lightweight Neural Synapse Modulators (NSMs). For each new task, a dedicated NSM is trained and then frozen, acting as an \"expert module.\" These modules perform detailed, node-attentive adaptive modulation on the computational flow of a shared GNN backbone. This setup ensures that new knowledge is kept within compact, task-specific modules, naturally preventing catastrophic forgetting without using any data replay. Additionally, to address the important challenge of unknown task IDs in real-world scenarios, we propose and theoretically prove a novel method named Anchored Multi-hop Propagation (AMP). Notably, we find that existing GCL benchmarks have flaws that can cause data leakage and biased evaluations. Therefore, we conduct all experiments in a more rigorous inductive learning scenario.

Standard reinitialization methods, which reinitialize weights toward their original values, are widely used but difficult to tune: conservative reinitializations fail to restore plasticity, while aggressive ones erase useful knowledge. We propose FIRE, a principled reinitialization method that explicitly balances the stability-plasticity tradeoff. FIRE quantifies stability through Squared Frobenius Error (SFE), measuring proximity to past weights, and plasticity through Deviation from Isometry (DfI), reflecting weight isotropy.

We validate our concept vectors via steering interventions that reliably manipulate model behavior in both simplified and naturalistic vision tasks (e.g., forcing the model to perceive a red flower as blue).

However, existing threshold determination methods face critical challenges: analytical bounds are overly conservative, while probabilistic approaches like A-ABFT yield thresholds $160$--$4200\\times$ larger than actual rounding errors. We present V-ABFT, a variance-based adaptive threshold algorithm that achieves tighter error bounds by directly modeling the verification difference. By leveraging statistical variance estimation, V-ABFT reduces the threshold-to-actual-error ratio to approximately $7$--$20\\times$ for FP32/FP64 and $48$--$158\\times$ for BF16, representing a \\textbf{6--48$\\times$ improvement} over A-ABFT while maintaining zero false positive rate across BF16, FP16, FP32, and FP64 precisions.

Prior approaches to bridge this gap are largely limited by oversimplified isotropic assumptions, hindering their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs.

Our method integrates expert-driven grid partitioning for distinguishable membership functions, domain-guided feature engineering to reduce redundancy, and rule pruning based on firing strength. This approach achieved comparable predictive performance to cluster-based FRBS while maintaining semantic interpretability and meeting structural complexity constraints, providing an explainable solution for water treatment applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u5728\u73af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u6e17\u900f\u6de1\u5316\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u56e0\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u533a\u5206\u6027\u4f4e\u800c\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u5212\u5206\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u7684\u96b6\u5c5e\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u9886\u57df\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e6\u53d1\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u4fee\u526a\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, jointly achieving strong safety and performance from fixed datasets remains challenging. Existing safe offline RL methods often rely on soft constraints that allow violations, introduce excessive conservatism, or struggle to balance safety, reward optimization, and adherence to the data distribution. To address this, we propose Epigraph-Guided Flow Matching (EpiFlow), a framework that formulates safe offline RL as a state-constrained optimal control problem to co-optimize safety and performance. We learn a feasibility value function derived from an epigraph reformulation of the optimal control problem, thereby avoiding the decoupled objectives or post-hoc filtering common in prior work. Policies are synthesized by reweighting the behavior distribution based on this epigraph value function and fitting a generative policy via flow matching, enabling efficient, distribution-consistent sampling.

Among many approaches to mitigate the inefficiencies of sequential token-by-token generation, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique. However, SD at the edge is hindered by two major challenges: (1) integrating SD into a compiler-based workflow without sacrificing performance or programmability, and (2) exploiting the heterogeneous compute resources of modern SoCs through carefully designed partitioning strategies. This work addresses these challenges by using an analytical cost model that explores heterogeneous hardware configurations and guides coarse-grained partitioning of LLM subgraphs, particularly with edge-typical short input sequence lengths.

Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability.\n  To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters. Performance remains robust after nine incremental updates, and BAGEL provides interpretability through its router's structural features. Our results show ensembles of small finetuned classifiers can match or exceed billion-parameter guardrails while offering the adaptability and efficiency required for production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6076\u610f\u63d0\u793a\u68c0\u6d4b\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u6846\u67b6BAGEL\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u6076\u610f\u63d0\u793a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBAGEL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f15\u5bfc\u805a\u5408\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u8def\u7531\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u6709\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "BAGEL\u9009\u62e95\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u6210\u5458\uff084.3\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u65f6F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.92\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eOpenAI Moderation API\u548cShieldGemma\uff0c\u591a\u6b21\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

Consequently, learning an unknown distribution with non-asymptotic and easy-to-compute error bounds in Wasserstein distance has become a fundamental problem in many fields. In this paper, we devise a novel algorithmic and theoretical framework to approximate an unknown probability distribution $\\mathbb{P}$ from a finite set of samples by an approximate discrete distribution $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ while bounding the Wasserstein distance between $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$. Our framework leverages optimal transport, nonlinear optimization, and concentration inequalities. In particular, we show that, even if $\\mathbb{P}$ is unknown, the Wasserstein distance between $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ can be efficiently bounded with high confidence by solving a tractable optimization problem (a mixed integer linear program) of a size that only depends on the size of the support of $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$. This enables us to develop intelligent clustering algorithms to optimally find the support of $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ while minimizing the Wasserstein distance error.

The discussion focuses on two domains in which this is particularly visible: competitive basic research funding and large EU consortium projects. Three accelerating trends are examined: the professionalization of proposal writing through specialized consultants, the rise of AI-assisted applications, and an evaluator shortage that forces panels to rely on reviewers increasingly distant from the actual research domains.

To fundamentally reconcile these paradigms, we propose SiameseNorm, a two-stream architecture that couples Pre-Norm-like and Post-Norm-like streams with shared parameters. This design decouples the optimization dynamics of the two streams, retaining the distinct characteristics of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm by enabling all residual blocks to receive combined gradients inherited from both paradigms, where one stream secures stability while the other enhances expressivity.

Existing bandit-based methods treat time merely as a timestamp, neglecting its explicit relationship with user preferences and leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, online learning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration-exploitation during the early online phase. To address these issues, we propose HyperBandit+, a novel contextual bandit policy that integrates a time-aware hypernetwork to adapt to time-varying user preferences and employs a large language model-assisted warm-start mechanism (LLM Start) to enhance exploration-exploitation efficiency in the early online phase. Specifically, HyperBandit+ leverages a neural network that takes time features as input and generates parameters for estimating time-varying rewards by capturing the correlation between time and user preferences. Additionally, the LLM Start mechanism employs multi-step data augmentation to simulate realistic interaction data for effective offline learning, providing warm-start parameters for the bandit policy in the early online phase. To meet real-time streaming recommendation demands, we adopt low-rank factorization to reduce hypernetwork training complexity. Theoretically, we rigorously establish a sublinear regret upper bound that accounts for both the hypernetwork and the LLM warm-start mechanism.

In Alzheimers disease (AD), multimodal neuroimaging offers complementary signals but VAE-based normative models often (i) fit the healthy reference distribution imperfectly, inflating false positives, and (ii) use posterior aggregation (e.g., PoE/MoE) that can yield weak multimodal fusion in the shared latent space. We propose mmSIVAE, a multimodal soft-introspective variational autoencoder combined with Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) aggregation to improve reference fidelity and multimodal integration. We compute deviation scores in latent space and feature space as distances from the learned healthy distributions, and map statistically significant latent deviations to regional abnormalities for interpretability. On ADNI MRI regional volumes and amyloid PET SUVR, mmSIVAE improves reconstruction on held-out controls and produces more discriminative deviation scores for outlier detection than VAE baselines, with higher likelihood ratios and clearer separation between control and AD-spectrum cohorts.

While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.\n  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine. Instead, they use a distributed representation that is nonetheless sufficient for making physical predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5185\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4ee5\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u65b9\u5f0f\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9010\u5c42\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6d88\u878d\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u89c6\u9891Transformer\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u201c\u7269\u7406\u6d8c\u73b0\u533a\u201d\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u6b64\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\uff1b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u7b49\u6807\u91cf\u65e9\u671f\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u5728\u201c\u7269\u7406\u6d8c\u73b0\u533a\u201d\u624d\u53ef\u7528\uff1b\u65b9\u5411\u901a\u8fc7\u5177\u6709\u5706\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u90a3\u6837\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

MTS performs mode-wise linear transformations with multiscale summation, enabling large receptive fields and effective modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. In MTSCSNet, MTS is first used as a learnable CS operator that performs linear dimensionality reduction in tensor space, with its adjoint defining the initial back-projection, and is then applied in the reconstruction stage to directly refine this estimate. This results in a simple feed-forward architecture without iterative or proximal optimization, while remaining parameter and computation efficient.

Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. This mismatch between evolving domains and static adaptation pipelines highlights the need for efficient, real-time adaptation without costly retraining.

Empirical evaluation under diverse drift scenarios demonstrates that ODD consistently surpasses LLM-Greedy and LLM-Temp Scaled across all syntactic and semantic NLG metrics.

Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off.

We present \\textit{Online Bayesian Imbalanced Learning} (OBIL), a principled framework that decouples likelihood-ratio estimation from class-prior assumptions, enabling real-time adaptation to distribution shifts without model retraining. Our approach builds on the established connection between Bregman divergences and proper scoring rules to show that deep networks trained with such losses produce posterior probability estimates from which prior-invariant likelihood ratios can be extracted. We prove that these likelihood-ratio estimates remain valid under arbitrary changes in class priors and cost structures, requiring only a threshold adjustment for optimal Bayes decisions.

We propose Bird-SR, a bidirectional reward-guided diffusion framework that formulates super-resolution as trajectory-level preference optimization via reward feedback learning (ReFL), jointly leveraging synthetic LR-HR pairs and real-world LR images. For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels. For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint. Furthermore, to balance structural and perceptual learning, we adopt a dynamic fidelity-perception weighting strategy that emphasizes structure preservation at early stages and progressively shifts focus toward perceptual optimization at later diffusion steps.

However, standard approaches typically rely on activation addition, a geometric operation that inevitably alters the magnitude of hidden representations. This raises concerns about representation collapse and degradation of open-ended generation capabilities. In this work, we explore Spherical Steering, a training-free primitive that resolves this trade-off through activation rotation. Rather than shifting activations with a fixed vector, our method rotates them along a geodesic toward a target direction, guiding the activation toward the target concept while preserving the integrity of the signal. To further enhance adaptivity, we incorporate a confidence gate that dynamically modulates steering strength based on input uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that Spherical Steering significantly outperforms addition-based baselines (notably by +10% on TruthfulQA, COPA, and Storycloze), while simultaneously maintaining the model's general open-ended generation quality.

To address challenges arising from increased traffic and diverse network architectures, organizations employ automated tools for firewall rule and access policy generation. Yet, effectively managing risks arising from dynamically generated policies, especially concerning critical asset exposure, remains a major challenge. This challenge is amplified by evolving network structures due to trends like remote users, bring-your-own devices, and cloud integration. This paper introduces a novel graph neural network model for identifying weighted shortest paths. The model aids in detecting network misconfigurations and high-risk connectivity paths that threaten critical assets, potentially exploited in zero-day attacks -- cyber-attacks exploiting undisclosed vulnerabilities. The proposed Pro-ZD framework adopts a proactive approach, automatically fine-tuning firewall rules and access policies to address high-risk connections and prevent unauthorized access. Experimental results highlight the robustness and transferability of Pro-ZD, achieving over 95% average accuracy in detecting high-risk connections. \\", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faPro - ZD\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u52a0\u6743\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8595%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5e26\u6765\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u4ea7\u66b4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u52a0\u6743\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8fde\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Pro - ZD\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u52a8\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u8c03\u9632\u706b\u5899\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePro - ZD\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8595%\u3002", "conclusion": "Pro - ZD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8fde\u63a5\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u6388\u6743\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002"}}

A critical question is whether statistically detectable heterogeneity translates into improved treatment decisions -- these are distinct questions that can yield contradictory answers. We present a modular causal machine learning framework that evaluates each question separately: permutation importance identifies which features predict heterogeneity, best linear predictor (BLP) testing assesses statistical significance, and doubly robust policy evaluation measures whether acting on the heterogeneity improves patient outcomes. We apply this framework to patient-level data from the UNIFI maintenance trial of ustekinumab in ulcerative colitis, comparing placebo, standard-dose ustekinumab every 12 weeks, and dose-intensified ustekinumab every 8 weeks, using cross-fitted X-learner models with baseline demographics, medication history, week-8 clinical scores, laboratory biomarkers, and video-derived endoscopic features. BLP testing identified strong associations between endoscopic features and treatment effect heterogeneity for ustekinumab versus placebo, yet doubly robust policy evaluation showed no improvement in expected remission from incorporating endoscopic features, and out-of-fold multi-arm evaluation showed worse performance. Diagnostic comparison of prognostic contribution against policy value revealed that endoscopic scores behaved as disease severity markers -- improving outcome prediction in untreated patients but adding noise to treatment selection -- while clinical variables (fecal calprotectin, age, CRP) captured the decision-relevant variation.

Recent studies show that sparse subsets of attention heads within an LALM can serve as strong discriminative feature extractors for downstream tasks such as classification via simple voting schemes. However, these methods assign uniform weights to all selected heads, implicitly assuming that each head contributes equally across all semantic categories. In this work, we propose Class-Conditional Sparse Attention Vectors for Large Audio-Language Models, a few-shot classification method that learns class-dependent importance weights over attention heads. This formulation allows individual heads to specialize in distinct semantic categories and to contribute to ensemble predictions proportionally to their estimated reliability. Experiments on multiple few-shot audio and audiovisual classification benchmarks and tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art uniform voting-based approaches by up to 14.52%, 1.53%, 8.35% absolute gains for audio classification, audio-visual classification, and spoofing detection respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5206\u914d\u5747\u5300\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5404\u5934\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u8d21\u732e\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4e0d\u591f\u5408\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faClass - Conditional Sparse Attention Vectors\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u7c7b\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u542c\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u97f3\u9891\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u89c6\u542c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca\u5206\u522b\u8fbe14.52%\u30011.53%\u30018.35%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u6295\u7968\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4f7f\u5355\u4e2a\u5934\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u6309\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5bf9\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u505a\u51fa\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

While recent advances have utilized foundation models to programmatically generate diverse environments, these approaches often focus on discovering isolated behaviors rather than orchestrating sustained progression. In complex open-ended worlds, the large combinatorial space of possible challenges makes it difficult for agents to discover sequences of experiences that remain consistently learnable. To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, \"dreaming\" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a $16\\%$ improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail. Our results suggest that code-level environment design provides a practical mechanism for curriculum control, enabling the construction of intermediate environments that bridge competence gaps in open-ended worlds.

The proposed framework bridges the gap between federated learning and multi-modal prompt-tuning which have traditionally focused on either uni-modal or centralized data. A key challenge in this setting arises from the lack of semantic alignment between prompt instructions that encode similar distributional patterns of missing data across different clients. To address this, our framework introduces specialized client-tuning and server-aggregation designs that simultaneously optimize, align, and aggregate prompt-tuning instructions across clients and data modalities.

The rapid development of intelligent tools, especially large language models (LLMs) with powerful knowledge reserves and interactive capabilities, has provided new paradigms for it.

To bridge this gap, we propose DrugR, an LLM-based method that introduces explicit, step-by-step pharmacological reasoning into the optimization process. Our approach integrates domain-specific continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning via reverse data engineering, and self-balanced multi-granular reinforcement learning. This framework enables DrugR to effectively improve key ADMET properties while preserving the original molecule's core efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that DrugR achieves comprehensive enhancement across multiple properties without compromising structural similarity or target binding affinity.

Such methods, while significantly more computationally favorable compared to their numerical counterparts, fail to provide any calibrated notions of uncertainty in their predictions. Current methods approach this deficiency typically with ensembling or Bayesian posterior estimation. However, these approaches either require distributional assumptions that fail to hold in practice or lack practical scalability, limiting their applications in practice. We, therefore, propose a novel application of conformal prediction to produce distribution-free uncertainty quantification over the function spaces mapped by neural operators. We then demonstrate how such prediction regions enable a formal regret characterization if leveraged in downstream robust decision-making tasks.

Existing memory-based methods primarily store raw trajectories, which are often redundant and noise-heavy.

In this paper, we propose SkillRL, a framework that bridges the gap between raw experience and policy improvement through automatic skill discovery and recursive evolution. Our approach introduces an experience-based distillation mechanism to build a hierarchical skill library SkillBank, an adaptive retrieval strategy for general and task-specific heuristics, and a recursive evolution mechanism that allows the skill library to co-evolve with the agent's policy during reinforcement learning. These innovations significantly reduce the token footprint while enhancing reasoning utility. Experimental results on ALFWorld, WebShop and seven search-augmented tasks demonstrate that SkillRL achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines over 15.3% and maintaining robustness as task complexity increases.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying their training performance and generalization remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide several insights into such fine-tuning through the lens of linearization. Fine-tuned models are often implicitly encouraged to remain close to the pretrained model. By making this explicit, using an Euclidean distance inductive bias in parameter space, we show that fine-tuning dynamics become equivalent to learning with the positive-definite neural tangent kernel (NTK). We specifically analyze how close the fully linear and the linearized fine-tuning optimizations are, based on the strength of the regularization. This allows us to be pragmatic about how good a model linearization is when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). When linearization is a good model, our findings reveal a strong correlation between the eigenvalue spectrum of the NTK and the performance of model adaptation. Motivated by this, we give spectral perturbation bounds on the NTK induced by the choice of layers selected for fine-tuning.

However, existing ICRL methods rely on explicit reward signals during pretraining, which limits their applicability when rewards are ambiguous, hard to specify, or costly to obtain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new learning paradigm, In-Context Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (ICPRL), in which both pretraining and deployment rely solely on preference feedback, eliminating the need for reward supervision. We study two variants that differ in the granularity of feedback: Immediate Preference-based RL (I-PRL) with per-step preferences, and Trajectory Preference-based RL (T-PRL) with trajectory-level comparisons. We first show that supervised pretraining, a standard approach in ICRL, remains effective under preference-only context datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of in-context reinforcement learning using only preference signals. To further improve data efficiency, we introduce alternative preference-native frameworks for I-PRL and T-PRL that directly optimize TM policies from preference data without requiring reward signals nor optimal action labels.Experiments on dueling bandits, navigation, and continuous control tasks demonstrate that ICPRL enables strong in-context generalization to unseen tasks, achieving performance comparable to ICRL methods trained with full reward supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0fICPRL\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u660e\u786e\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u96be\u6307\u5b9a\u6216\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u65f6\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faICPRL\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76I - PRL\u548cT - PRL\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u504f\u597d\u539f\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eICPRL\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5168\u5956\u52b1\u76d1\u7763\u7684ICRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "ICPRL\u53ef\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, they still suffer from inherent limitations in resource efficiency, context management, and multimodal perception. Based on these observations, Lemon Agent is introduced, a multi-agent orchestrator-worker system built on a newly proposed AgentCortex framework, which formalizes the classic Planner-Executor-Memory paradigm through an adaptive task execution mechanism. Our system integrates a hierarchical self-adaptive scheduling mechanism that operates at both the overall orchestrator layer and workers layer. This mechanism can dynamically adjust computational intensity based on task complexity. It enables orchestrator to allocate one or more workers for parallel subtask execution, while workers can further improve operational efficiency by invoking tools concurrently. By virtue of this two-tier architecture, the system achieves synergistic balance between global task coordination and local task execution, thereby optimizing resource utilization and task processing efficiency in complex scenarios. To reduce context redundancy and increase information density during parallel steps, we adopt a three-tier progressive context management strategy. To make fuller use of historical information, we propose a self-evolving memory system, which can extract multi-dimensional valid information from all historical experiences to assist in completing similar tasks. Furthermore, we provide an enhanced MCP toolset.

We take a probabilistic view and model the posterior over transformations as a Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy function on data space. To sample from this posterior, we introduce a diffusion process on Lie groups that keeps all updates on-manifold and only requires computations in the associated Lie algebra. Our method, Transformation-Inverting Energy Diffusion (TIED), relies on a new trivialized target-score identity that enables efficient score-based sampling of the transformation posterior. As a key application, we focus on test-time equivariance, where the objective is to improve the robustness of pretrained neural networks to input transformations.

Analysing the Learning Efficiency of Agentic Systems", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for training or fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), enabling adaptive, task-specific optimizations through interactive feedback. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), in particular, offers a promising avenue by decomposing complex tasks into specialized subtasks learned by distinct interacting agents, potentially enhancing the ability and efficiency of LLM systems. However, theoretical insights regarding when and why MARL outperforms Single-Agent RL (SARL) remain limited, creating uncertainty in selecting the appropriate RL framework. In this paper, we address this critical gap by rigorously analyzing the comparative sample efficiency of MARL and SARL within the context of LLM. Leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework, we formally define SARL and MARL setups for LLMs, derive explicit sample complexity bounds, and systematically characterize how task decomposition and alignment influence learning efficiency.

This task is challenging due to the noisy and sparse nature of single-cell measurements, as well as the fact that perturbations often induce population-level shifts rather than changes in individual cells. Existing deep learning methods typically assume cell-level correspondences, limiting their ability to capture such global effects. We present scDFM, a generative framework based on conditional flow matching that models the full distribution of perturbed cells conditioned on control states. By incorporating a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) objective, our method aligns perturbed and control populations beyond cell-level correspondences. To further improve robustness to sparsity and noise, we introduce the Perturbation-Aware Differential Transformer (PAD-Transformer), a backbone architecture that leverages gene interaction graphs and differential attention to capture context-specific expression changes. Across multiple genetic and drug perturbation benchmarks, scDFM consistently outperforms prior methods, demonstrating strong generalization in both unseen and combinatorial settings. In the combinatorial setting, it reduces mean squared error by 19.6% relative to the strongest baseline.

We study grokking in one of the simplest possible settings: the learning of a linear model with logistic loss for binary classification on data that are linearly (and max margin) separable about the origin. We investigate three testing regimes: (1) test data drawn from the same distribution as the training data, in which case grokking is not observed; (2) test data concentrated around the margin, in which case grokking is observed; and (3) adversarial test data generated via projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks, in which case grokking is also observed. We theoretically show that the implicit bias of gradient descent induces a three-phase learning process-population-dominated, support-vector-dominated unlearning, and support-vector-dominated generalization-during which delayed generalization can arise. Our analysis further relates the emergence of grokking to asymmetries in the data, both in the number of examples per class and in the distribution of support vectors across classes, and yields a characterization of the grokking time. We experimentally validate our theory by planting different distributions of population points and support vectors, and by analyzing accuracy curves and hyperplane dynamics.

While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible.

However, they do not work well for deep chains. The root cause of this limitation stems from the Semantic Entanglement problem in these extended workflows. In standard textual backpropagation, feedback signals mix local critiques with upstream contexts, leading to Attribution Ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose TextResNet, a framework that reformulates the optimization process to achieve precise signal routing via four key innovations. Firstly, in the forward pass, it enforces Additive Semantic Deltas to preserve an Identity Highway for gradient flow. Secondly, in the backward pass, it introduces Semantic Gradient Decomposition via a Semantic Projector to disentangle feedback into causally independent subspaces. Thirdly, it implements Causal Routing, which routes projected signals to their specific components.

A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation.

Existing CoT compression methods often suffer from a critical loss of logical fidelity at high compression ratios, resulting in significant performance degradation. To achieve high-fidelity, fast reasoning, we propose a novel EXTreme-RAtio Chain-of-Thought Compression framework, termed Extra-CoT, which aggressively reduces the token budget while preserving answer accuracy. To generate reliable, high-fidelity supervision, we first train a dedicated semantically-preserved compressor on mathematical CoT data with fine-grained annotations. An LLM is then fine-tuned on these compressed pairs via a mixed-ratio supervised fine-tuning (SFT), teaching it to follow a spectrum of compression budgets and providing a stable initialization for reinforcement learning (RL). We further propose Constrained and Hierarchical Ratio Policy Optimization (CHRPO) to explicitly incentivize question-solving ability under lower budgets by a hierarchical reward. Experiments on three mathematical reasoning benchmarks show the superiority of Extra-CoT.

Although near-oracle top-k KV selection can preserve the quality of dense attention while sharply reducing computation and bandwidth, existing sparse methods generally rely on posterior heuristics, i.e., selectors conditioned on observed attention or proxy scores. Such conditioning introduces posterior bias: it tends to distort true token importance and miss salient tokens, thereby impairing long-range reasoning. To tackle this problem, we propose Pre-hoc Sparsity (PrHS), which selects KV entries before attention scoring and provides explicit accuracy control. Let the attention mass of discarded entries be delta (the dropped mass). Through a marginal-to-mutual-information analysis, we derive an upper bound on the mutual-information loss that depends only on the dropped mass. This relation explains failure modes of posterior heuristics and enables verifiable guarantees by controlling the dropped mass in advance. Within PrHS, we instantiate three orthogonal pre-hoc selectors along the axes of time, depth, and layer. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Mistral families validate PrHS. Across GSM8K and CoQA, PrHS reduces retrieval overhead by over 90%, achieving 3x higher retrieval sparsity than HShare at matched or better accuracy. It incurs under 1% average degradation on LongBench, lowers attention FLOPs by about 15% versus prior sparse baselines, and yields a 9.9x speedup in attention-operator latency and 2.8x higher throughput on NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs than the dense baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPre - hoc Sparsity (PrHS) \u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406 KV \u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u540e\u9a8c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u540e\u9a8c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa PrHS \u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u524d\u9009\u62e9 KV \u6761\u76ee\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u9645\u5230\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e0a\u9650\uff1b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u9884\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728 LLaMA \u548c Mistral \u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cPrHS \u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u7d22\u5f00\u9500\u8d85 90%\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u6bd4 HShare \u9ad8 3 \u500d\uff0c\u5728 LongBench \u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u5c0f\u4e8e 1%\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u7ea6 15%\uff0c\u5728 NVIDIA A100 - 80GB GPUs \u4e0a\u4f7f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b97\u5b50\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a0\u901f 9.9 \u500d\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8 2.8 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PrHS \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d KV \u7f13\u5b58\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Emerging generative AI tools offer new possibilities for scaffolding collaboration, but their role in mediating in-person group work remains underexplored, especially from the perspective of educators. This paper presents findings from an exploratory qualitative study with 33 K12 teachers who interacted with Phoenix, a voice-based conversational agent designed to function as a near-peer in face-to-face group collaboration. Drawing on playtesting sessions, surveys, and focus groups, we examine how teachers perceived the agent's behavior, its influence on group dynamics, and its classroom potential. While many appreciated Phoenix's capacity to stimulate engagement, they also expressed concerns around autonomy, trust, anthropomorphism, and pedagogical alignment. We contribute empirical insights into teachers' mental models of AI, reveal core design tensions, and outline considerations for group-facing AI agents that support meaningful, collaborative learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8K12\u6559\u5e08\u5bf9\u8bed\u97f3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406Phoenix\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u9762\u5c0f\u7ec4\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u6fc0\u53d1\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u534f\u4f5c\u662f21\u4e16\u7eaa\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u4f46\u6559\u5e08\u652f\u6301\u540c\u4f34\u4e92\u52a8\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65b0\u5174\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8c03\u89e3\u9762\u5bf9\u9762\u5c0f\u7ec4\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4ece\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5bf933\u540dK12\u6559\u5e08\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u7126\u70b9\u5c0f\u7ec4\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u6559\u5e08\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u5bf9\u5c0f\u7ec4\u52a8\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u8bfe\u5802\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bb8\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u8d5e\u8d4fPhoenix\u6fc0\u53d1\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8868\u793a\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u7684AI\u5fc3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6838\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9762\u5411\u5c0f\u7ec4\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u51fa\u8003\u8651\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

In ReLU-based models, the activation pattern induced by a given input determines the piecewise-linear region in which the network behaves affinely. Motivated by this geometry, we investigate whether training exhibits a two-timescale behavior: an early stage with substantial changes in activation patterns and a later stage where weight updates predominantly refine the model within largely stable activation regimes. We first prove a local stability property: outside measure-zero sets of parameters and inputs, sufficiently small parameter perturbations preserve the activation pattern of a fixed input, implying locally affine behavior within activation regions. We then empirically track per-iteration changes in weights and activation patterns across fully-connected and convolutional architectures, as well as Transformer-based models, where activation patterns are recorded in the ReLU feed-forward (MLP/FFN) submodules, using fixed validation subsets. Across the evaluated settings, activation-pattern changes decay 3 times earlier than weight-update magnitudes, showing that late-stage training often proceeds within relatively stable activation regimes. These findings provide a concrete, architecture-agnostic instrument for monitoring training dynamics and motivate further study of decoupled optimization strategies for piecewise-linear networks.

This formulation results in a multiple-right-hand-side box-constrained integer least squares (BILS) problem in each layer, which is NP-hard. For each column of the weight matrix, we apply an extended Babai nearest-plane algorithm and an extended version of Klein's randomized Babai algorithm to find the minimum-residual Babai-Klein point, a sub-optimal solution to the BILS problem. Experimental results on large language models show that OJBKQ achieves lower perplexity at 3-4 bits compared to existing PTQ approaches, while maintaining comparable computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOJBKQ\u5c42\u7ea7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u57283 - 4\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8d2a\u5a6a\u820d\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f62\u6210BILS\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u7684Babai\u6700\u8fd1\u5e73\u9762\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cKlein\u968f\u673aBabai\u7b97\u6cd5\u627e\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cOJBKQ\u57283 - 4\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0b\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "OJBKQ\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a similar flexibility in adopting different personas and behaviors. Existing approaches, however, typically adapt such behavior through external knowledge such as prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or fine-tuning. We ask: do LLMs really need external context or parameters to adapt to different behaviors, or do they already have such knowledge embedded in their parameters? In this work, we show that LLMs already contain persona-specialized subnetworks in their parameter space. Using small calibration datasets, we identify distinct activation signatures associated with different personas. Guided by these statistics, we develop a masking strategy that isolates lightweight persona subnetworks. Building on the findings, we further discuss: how can we discover opposing subnetwork from the model that lead to binary-opposing personas, such as introvert-extrovert? To further enhance separation in binary opposition scenarios, we introduce a contrastive pruning strategy that identifies parameters responsible for the statistical divergence between opposing personas. Our method is entirely training-free and relies solely on the language model's existing parameter space. Across diverse evaluation settings, the resulting subnetworks exhibit significantly stronger persona alignment than baselines that require external knowledge while being more efficient. Our findings suggest that diverse human-like behaviors are not merely induced in LLMs, but are already embedded in their parameter space, pointing toward a new perspective on controllable and interpretable personalization in large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5df2\u5305\u542b\u7279\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u79bb\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5b50\u7f51\u89d2\u8272\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u5426\u53d1\u73b0\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8c\u5143\u5bf9\u7acb\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u5c0f\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u79bb\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89d2\u8272\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6bd4\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u4e8c\u5143\u5bf9\u7acb\u573a\u666f\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6bd4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u591a\u6837\u7684\u7c7b\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u5df2\u5d4c\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u56de\u6eaf\u53cd\u9988\uff08RLBF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff08BSAFE+\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRLBF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u7ea0\u6b63\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u63d0\u51faBSAFE+\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u5b89\u5168\u6587\u672c\u6ce8\u5165\u8fdd\u89c4\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "RLBF\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "RLBF\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper introduces an information theoretic framework for analyzing how explanation modality specifically, voice versus text affects user comprehension and trust calibration in AI systems. The proposed model treats explanation delivery as a communication channel between model and user, characterized by metrics for information retention, comprehension efficiency (CE), and trust calibration error (T CE). A simulation framework implemented in Python was developed to evaluate these metrics using synthetic SHAP based feature attributions across multiple modality style configurations (brief, detailed, and analogy based). Results demonstrate that text explanations achieve higher comprehension efficiency, while voice explanations yield improved trust calibration, with analogy based delivery achieving the best overall trade off.

The core element of an SNN is the spiking neuron, which converts input data into spikes following the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model. This model includes several important hyperparameters, such as the membrane potential threshold and membrane time constant. Both the DNNs and SNNs have proven to be exploitable by backdoor attacks, where an adversary can poison the training dataset with malicious triggers and force the model to behave in an attacker-defined manner. Yet, how an adversary can exploit the unique characteristics of SNNs for backdoor attacks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose \\textit{BadSNN}, a novel backdoor attack on spiking neural networks that exploits hyperparameter variations of spiking neurons to inject backdoor behavior into the model. We further propose a trigger optimization process to achieve better attack performance while making trigger patterns less perceptible. \\textit{BadSNN} demonstrates superior attack performance on various datasets and architectures, as well as compared with state-of-the-art data poisoning-based backdoor attacks and robustness against common backdoor mitigation techniques.

Although recent works incorporate structural information, they implicitly condition adaptation on the smoothness priors of sourcetrained GNNs, thereby limiting their generalization to structurally distinct targets. This dependency becomes a critical bottleneck under significant topological shifts, where the source model misinterprets distinct topological patterns unseen in the source domain as noise, rendering pseudo-label-based adaptation unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Universal Structural Basis Distillation, a framework that shifts the paradigm from adapting a biased model to learning a universal structural basis for SF-GDA. Instead of adapting a biased source model to a specific target, our core idea is to construct a structure-agnostic basis that proactively covers the full spectrum of potential topological patterns. Specifically, USBD employs a bi-level optimization framework to distill the source dataset into a compact structural basis. By enforcing the prototypes to span the full Dirichlet energy spectrum, the learned basis explicitly captures diverse topological motifs, ranging from low-frequency clusters to high-frequency chains, beyond those present in the source. This ensures that the learned basis creates a comprehensive structural covering capable of handling targets with disparate structures. For inference, we introduce a spectral-aware ensemble mechanism that dynamically activates the optimal prototype combination based on the spectral fingerprint of the target graph. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that USBD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with severe structural shifts, while achieving superior computational efficiency by decoupling the adaptation cost from the target data scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u84b8\u998f\uff08USBD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3 SF - GDA \u4e2d\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 SF - GDA \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6e90\u8bad\u7ec3 GNN \u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u65f6\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa USBD \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u70bc\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u539f\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u80fd\u91cf\u8c31\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u6837\u62d3\u6251\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cUSBD \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u89e3\u8026\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "USBD \u4e3a SF - GDA \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We adopt a simple philosophical view, robust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced it, and treat reasoning as a form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer.

However, existing RLVR methods utilize rollouts in an indiscriminate and short-horizon manner: responses of heterogeneous quality within each prompt are treated uniformly, and historical rollouts are discarded after a single use. This leads to noisy supervision, poor sample efficiency, and suboptimal policy updates. We address these issues by formulating rollout scheduling in RLVR as a contextual bandit problem and proposing a unified neural scheduling framework that adaptively selects high-value rollouts throughout training. Each rollout is treated as an arm whose reward is defined by the induced performance gain between consecutive optimization steps. The resulting scheduler supports both noise-aware intra-group selection and adaptive global reuse of historical rollouts within a single principled framework. We provide theoretical justification by deriving sublinear regret bounds and showing that enlarging the rollout buffer improves the achievable performance upper bound.

Evidence of Alignment and Decoupling in Heterogeneous GNNs", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Meta-path-based heterogeneous graph neural networks aggregate over meta-path-induced views, and their semantic-level attention over meta-path channels is widely used as a narrative for ``which semantics matter.'' We study this assumption empirically by asking: when does meta-path attention reflect meta-path importance, and when can it decouple? A key challenge is that most post-hoc GNN explainers are designed for homogeneous graphs, and naive adaptations to heterogeneous neighborhoods can mix semantics and confound perturbations. To enable a controlled empirical analysis, we introduce MetaXplain, a meta-path-aware post-hoc explanation protocol that applies existing explainers in the native meta-path view domain via (i) view-factorized explanations, (ii) schema-valid channel-wise perturbations, and (iii) fusion-aware attribution, without modifying the underlying predictor. We benchmark representative gradient-, perturbation-, and Shapley-style explainers on ACM, DBLP, and IMDB with HAN and HAN-GCN, comparing against xPath and type-matched random baselines under standard faithfulness metrics. To quantify attention reliability, we propose Meta-Path Attention--Explanation Alignment (MP-AEA), which measures rank correlation between learned attention weights and explanation-derived meta-path contribution scores across random runs. Our results show that meta-path-aware explanations typically outperform random controls, while MP-AEA reveals both high-alignment and statistically significant decoupling regimes depending on the dataset and backbone; moreover, retraining on explanation-induced subgraphs often preserves, and in some noisy regimes improves, predictive performance, suggesting an explanation-as-denoising effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f55\u65f6\u53cd\u6620\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u4f55\u65f6\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5f15\u5165MetaXplain\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMP - AEA\u91cf\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u91ca\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u4e14\u6709\u53bb\u566a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u4f55\u65f6\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6570\u4e8b\u540eGNN\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MetaXplain\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u901a\u9053\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u878d\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u5f52\u56e0\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u63d0\u51faMP - AEA\u91cf\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u91ca\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\uff1bMP - AEA\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u9ad8\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u663e\u8457\u89e3\u8026\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5b50\u56fe\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e38\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MetaXplain\u534f\u8bae\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5143\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u6709\u53bb\u566a\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Despite its significance in industrial applications such as fraud detection and user segmentation, a significant chasm persists between academic research and real-world deployment. Current evaluation protocols suffer from the small-scale, high-homophily citation datasets, non-scalable full-batch training paradigms, and a reliance on supervised metrics that fail to reflect performance in label-scarce environments. To bridge these gaps, we present PyAGC, a comprehensive, production-ready benchmark and library designed to stress-test AGC methods across diverse scales and structural properties. We unify existing methodologies into a modular Encode-Cluster-Optimize framework and, for the first time, provide memory-efficient, mini-batch implementations for a wide array of state-of-the-art AGC algorithms. Our benchmark curates 12 diverse datasets, ranging from 2.7K to 111M nodes, specifically incorporating industrial graphs with complex tabular features and low homophily.

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning.

Model merging offers a compelling alternative by directly integrating the weights of multiple source models without requiring additional data or extensive training. However, conventional model merging techniques, such as parameter averaging, often suffer from the unintended combination of non-generalizable features, especially when source models exhibit significant weight disparities. Comparatively, model ensembling generally provides more stable and superior performance that aggregates multiple models by averaging outputs. However, it incurs higher inference costs and increased storage requirements. While previous studies experimentally showed the similarities between model merging and ensembling, theoretical evidence and evaluation metrics remain lacking. To address this gap, we introduce Merging-ensembling loss (M-Loss), a novel evaluation metric that quantifies the compatibility of merging source models using very limited unlabeled data. By measuring the discrepancy between parameter averaging and model ensembling at layer and node levels, M-Loss facilitates more effective merging strategies. Specifically, M-Loss serves both as a quantitative criterion of the theoretical feasibility of model merging, and a guide for parameter significance in model pruning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate that incorporating M-Loss into the merging process significantly improves the alignment between merged models and model ensembling, providing a scalable and efficient framework for accurate model consolidation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u63d0\u51faM-Loss\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u6709\u975e\u6cdb\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Merging - ensembling loss\uff08M - Loss\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5316\u5408\u5e76\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5c42\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u5c42\u9762\u8861\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5c06M - Loss\u878d\u5165\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "M - Loss\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

It is a profound question, with philosophical and existential implications. There is also an obvious connection with religious beliefs, as gods and other superhuman beings were imagined in the heavens. Speculations about alien beings grew in time, and today, it is a scientific subject of astrobiology, and it is pursued through serious searches for life and intelligence in the universe. However, almost all imaginings of the alien map terrestrial life forms and human cultural, historical, and psychological phenomena to the putative aliens. This lack of individual and collective imagination may reflect our biological and cultural evolution, as our minds are formed through our experiences, perceptions of the world, and interactions with our terrestrial and human environments. As such, imagining aliens is mainly a cultural phenomenon and may reflect the intrinsic cognitive limitations of the human mind.

Motivated by recent progress in conditional sequence modeling (CSM), which enables flexible goal-conditioned control by specifying target returns, we propose RCDT, a CSM-based method that supports zero-shot deployment across multiple cost thresholds within a single trained policy. RCDT is the first CSM-based offline safe RL algorithm that integrates a Lagrangian-style cost penalty with an auto-adaptive penalty coefficient. To avoid overly conservative behavior and achieve a more favorable return--cost trade-off, a reward--cost-aware trajectory reweighting mechanism and Q-value regularization are further incorporated.

In this paper, we propose that optimal budget allocation should be governed by the marginal utility in preserving long-term semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose LU-KV, a novel framework that optimizes head-level budget allocation through a convex-hull relaxation and a marginal-utility-based greedy solver to achieve near-optimal precision.

Owing to the increasing importance of algorithmic fairness, we consider the problem of computing PR vectors subject to various group-fairness criteria based on sensitive attributes of the vertices. At present, principled algorithms for this problem are lacking - some cannot guarantee that a target fairness level is achieved, while others do not feature optimality guarantees. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we put forth a unified in-processing convex optimization framework, termed FairRARI, for tackling different group-fairness criteria in a ``plug and play'' fashion. Leveraging a variational formulation of PR, the framework computes fair PR vectors by solving a strongly convex optimization problem with fairness constraints, thereby ensuring that a target fairness level is achieved. We further introduce three different fairness criteria which can be efficiently tackled using FairRARI to compute fair PR vectors with the same asymptotic time-complexity as the original PR algorithm.

However, the existing methods face notable limitations, including limited pre-training scale or heavy reliance on textual information. Motivated by the success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) in achieving universal prediction across diverse tabular datasets, we explore an alternative approach by TFMs, which are pre-trained on diverse synthetic datasets sampled from structural causal models and support strong in-context learning independent of textual attributes. Nevertheless, adapting TFMs for link prediction faces severe technical challenges such as how to obtain the necessary context and capture link-centric topological information. To solve these challenges, we propose TFMLinker (Tabular Foundation Model for Link Predictor), aiming to leverage the in-context learning capabilities of TFMs to perform link prediction across diverse graphs without requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a prototype-augmented local-global context module to construct context that captures both graph-specific and cross-graph transferable patterns. Next, we design a universal topology-aware link encoder to capture link-centric topological information and generate link representations as inputs for the TFM. Finally, we employ the TFM to predict link existence through in-context learning.

However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0MoE\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8def\u7531\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u4f1a\u4f7f\u5b89\u5168\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u6709\u5bb3\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRoSais\u548cF - SOUR\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8MoE\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6548\u7528\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76MoE\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RoSais\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u5c42\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51faF - SOUR\u6846\u67b6\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u7531\u3002", "result": "\u5728JailbreakBench\u4e0a\uff0cDeepSeek - V2 - Lite\u63a9\u76d65\u4e2a\u8def\u7531\u5668\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d854\u500d\u81f30.79\uff1bF - SOUR\u5728JailbreakBench\u548cAdvBench\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe0.90\u548c0.98\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7981\u7528\u548c\u8def\u7531\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4e3a\u672a\u6765MoE\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u9632\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

We propose a risk-sensitive evaluation framework that quantifies hallucinations through the presence of risk-bearing language, including treatment directives, contraindications, urgency cues, and mentions of high-risk medications. Rather than assessing clinical correctness, our approach evaluates the potential impact of hallucinated content if acted upon. We further combine risk scoring with a relevance measure to identify high-risk, low-grounding failures. We apply this framework to three instruction-tuned language models using controlled patient-facing prompts designed as safety stress tests. Our results show that models with similar surface-level behavior exhibit substantially different risk profiles and that standard evaluation metrics fail to capture these distinctions.

However, the standard practice of sampling from random Gaussian noise often requires multiple iterative steps to produce clean actions, leading to high inference latency that incurs a major bottleneck for real-time control. In this paper, we challenge the necessity of uninformed noise sampling and propose Action-to-Action flow matching (A2A), a novel policy paradigm that shifts from random sampling to initialization informed by the previous action. Unlike existing methods that treat proprioceptive action feedback as static conditions, A2A leverages historical proprioceptive sequences, embedding them into a high-dimensional latent space as the starting point for action generation. This design bypasses costly iterative denoising while effectively capturing the robot's physical dynamics and temporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2A exhibits high training efficiency, fast inference speed, and improved generalization. Notably, A2A enables high-quality action generation in as few as a single inference step (0.56 ms latency), and exhibits superior robustness to visual perturbations and enhanced generalization to unseen configurations. Lastly, we also extend A2A to video generation, demonstrating its broader versatility in temporal modeling.

A key challenge in unsupervised TSAD is that many anomalies are too subtle to exhibit detectable deviation in any single view (e.g., time domain), and instead manifest as inconsistencies across multiple views like time, frequency, and a mixture of resolutions. However, most cross-view methods rely on feature or score fusion and do not enforce analysis-synthesis consistency, meaning the frequency branch is not required to reconstruct the time signal through an inverse transform, and vice versa. In this paper, we present Learnable Fusion of Tri-view Tokens (LEFT), a unified unsupervised TSAD framework that models anomalies as inconsistencies across complementary representations. LEFT learns feature tokens from three views of the same input time series: frequency-domain tokens that embed periodicity information, time-domain tokens that capture local dynamics, and multi-scale tokens that learns abnormal patterns at varying time series granularities. By learning a set of adaptive Nyquist-constrained spectral filters, the original time series is rescaled into multiple resolutions and then encoded, allowing these multi-scale tokens to complement the extracted frequency- and time-domain information. When generating the fused representation, we introduce a novel objective that reconstructs fine-grained targets from coarser multi-scale structure, and put forward an innovative time-frequency cycle consistency constraint to explicitly regularize cross-view agreement.

Users often employ follow-up questions to refine their intent, expecting LLMs to adapt dynamically. However, recent research reveals that LLMs suffer a substantial performance drop in multi-turn settings compared to single-turn interactions with fully specified instructions, a phenomenon termed ``Lost in Conversation'' (LiC). While this prior work attributes LiC to model unreliability, we argue that the root cause lies in an intent alignment gap rather than intrinsic capability deficits. In this paper, we first demonstrate that LiC is not a failure of model capability but rather a breakdown in interaction between users and LLMs. We theoretically show that scaling model size or improving training alone cannot resolve this gap, as it arises from structural ambiguity in conversational context rather than representational limitations. To address this, we propose to decouple intent understanding from task execution through a Mediator-Assistant architecture. By utilizing an experience-driven Mediator to explicate user inputs into explicit, well-structured instructions based on historical interaction patterns, our approach effectively bridges the gap between vague user intent and model interpretation.

Existing fairness notions for generative models are largely adapted from classification and focus on balancing the probability of generating samples from each sensitive group. We show that such criteria are brittle, as they can be met even when different sensitive groups are modeled with widely varying quality. To address this limitation, we introduce a new fairness definition for generative models, termed as equalized generative treatment (EGT), which requires comparable generation quality across all sensitive groups, with quality measured via a reference f-divergence. We further analyze the trade-offs induced by EGT, demonstrating that enforcing fairness constraints necessarily couples the overall model quality to that of the most challenging group to approximate.

Today, we unveil LLaDA2.1, a paradigm shift designed to transcend this trade-off. By seamlessly weaving Token-to-Token (T2T) editing into the conventional Mask-to-Token (M2T) scheme, we introduce a joint, configurable threshold-decoding scheme. This structural innovation gives rise to two distinct personas: the Speedy Mode (S Mode), which audaciously lowers the M2T threshold to bypass traditional constraints while relying on T2T to refine the output; and the Quality Mode (Q Mode), which leans into conservative thresholds to secure superior benchmark performances with manageable efficiency degrade. Furthering this evolution, underpinned by an expansive context window, we implement the first large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework specifically tailored for dLLMs, anchored by specialized techniques for stable gradient estimation. This alignment not only sharpens reasoning precision but also elevates instruction-following fidelity, bridging the chasm between diffusion dynamics and complex human intent. We culminate this work by releasing LLaDA2.1-Mini (16B) and LLaDA2.1-Flash (100B). Across 33 rigorous benchmarks, LLaDA2.1 delivers strong task performance and lightning-fast decoding speed.

LLM agents maintain working memory through their context window, which stores interaction history for decision-making. Conventional agents indiscriminately accumulate all tool outputs and reasoning traces in this memory, creating two critical vulnerabilities: (1) injected instructions persist throughout the workflow, granting attackers multiple opportunities to manipulate behavior, and (2) verbose, non-essential content degrades decision-making capabilities. Existing defenses treat bloated memory as given and focus on remaining resilient, rather than reducing unnecessary accumulation to prevent the attack.\n  We present AgentSys, a framework that defends against indirect prompt injection through explicit memory management. Inspired by process memory isolation in operating systems, AgentSys organizes agents hierarchically: a main agent spawns worker agents for tool calls, each running in an isolated context and able to spawn nested workers for subtasks. External data and subtask traces never enter the main agent's memory; only schema-validated return values can cross boundaries through deterministic JSON parsing. Ablations show isolation alone cuts attack success to 2.19%, and adding a validator/sanitizer further improves defense with event-triggered checks whose overhead scales with operations rather than context length.\n  On AgentDojo and ASB, AgentSys achieves 0.78% and 4.25% attack success while slightly improving benign utility over undefended baselines. It remains robust to adaptive attackers and across multiple foundation models, showing that explicit memory management enables secure, dynamic LLM agent architectures.

To address these challenges, we propose CompilerKV, a risk-adaptive and head-aware compression framework that compiles offline experience into reusable decision tables for prefill-only deployment. CompilerKV integrates two key synergistic components: (i) a Head Heterogeneity Table, learned via offline contextual bandits, which assigns head-specific reliability weights to govern functional differences across attention heads explicitly; and (ii) a Risk-Adaptive Threshold Gating mechanism that jointly models attention entropy and local perplexity, transforming prompt-level risk into deployable retention thresholds.

Together, these components are unified in an online RL loop to align code LLMs to generate secure and functional code.

In this work, we introduce an inverse reinforcement learning framework for learning sampling strategies without retraining the denoiser. We formulate the diffusion sampling procedure as a discrete-time finite-horizon Markov Decision Process, where actions correspond to optional modifications of the sampling dynamics.

This study explores whether multi-agent systems can establish \"virtual social norms\" to encourage donation behavior. We conducted an online experiment where participants interacted with a group of agents to discuss donation behaviors. Changes in perceived social norms, conformity, donation behavior, and user experience were measured pre- and postdiscussion. Results show that multi-agent interactions effectively increased perceived social norms and donation willingness. Notably, in-group agents led to stronger perceived social norms, higher conformity, and greater donation increases compared to out-group agents. Our findings demonstrate the potential of multi-agent systems for creating social norm interventions and offer insights into leveraging social identity dynamics to promote prosocial behavior in virtual environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5426\u5efa\u7acb\u201c\u865a\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u201d\u9f13\u52b1\u6350\u8d60\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u6350\u8d60\u610f\u613f\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u5e72\u9884\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5426\u5efa\u7acb\u201c\u865a\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u201d\u4ee5\u9f13\u52b1\u6350\u8d60\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8ba9\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e0e\u4e00\u7ec4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba8\u8bba\u6350\u8d60\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u8ba8\u8bba\u524d\u540e\u611f\u77e5\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u4ece\u4f17\u6027\u3001\u6350\u8d60\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u6350\u8d60\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u7ec4\u5185\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6bd4\u7ec4\u5916\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4ece\u4f17\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6350\u8d60\u589e\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We introduce an active probabilistic reasoning task that cleanly separates sampling (actively acquiring evidence) from inference (integrating evidence toward a decision). Benchmarking humans and a broad set of contemporary large language models against near-optimal reference policies reveals a consistent pattern: extended reasoning is the key determinant of strong performance, driving large gains in inference and producing belief trajectories that become strikingly human-like, while yielding only modest improvements in active sampling. To explain these differences, we fit a mechanistic model that captures systematic deviations from optimal behavior via four interpretable latent variables: memory, strategy, choice bias, and occlusion awareness. This model places humans and models in a shared low-dimensional cognitive space, reproduces behavioral signatures across agents, and shows how chain-of-thought shifts language models toward human-like regimes of evidence accumulation and belief-to-choice mapping, tightening alignment in inference while leaving a persistent gap in information acquisition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u662f\u5426\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u53ca\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ca\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e3b\u52a8\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5f00\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u62df\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u6709\u5927\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f7f\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8f68\u8ff9\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u673a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u91cd\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5 - \u9009\u62e9\u6620\u5c04\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u4ecd\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Here, we study noise-robust learning: are transformers trained on data with noisy features able to find a target function that correctly predicts labels for noiseless features? We show that transformers succeed at noise-robust learning for a selection of $k$-sparse parity and majority functions, compared to LSTMs which fail at this task for even modest feature noise. However, we find that transformers typically fail at noise-robust learning of random $k$-juntas, especially when the boolean sensitivity of the optimal solution is smaller than that of the target function. We argue that this failure is due to a combination of two factors: transformers' bias toward simpler functions, combined with an observation that the optimal function for noise-robust learning typically has lower sensitivity than the target function for random boolean functions. We test this hypothesis by exploiting transformers' simplicity bias to trap them in an incorrect solution, but show that transformers can escape this trap by training with an additional loss term penalizing high-sensitivity solutions.

However, existing controllers are commonly driven either by predefined motion trajectories, which offer limited flexibility when user intent changes, or by continuous human teleoperation, which requires constant human involvement and limits autonomy. This work addresses the problem of how to drive a universal humanoid controller in a real-time and interactive manner. We present TextOp, a real-time text-driven humanoid motion generation and control framework that supports streaming language commands and on-the-fly instruction modification during execution. TextOp adopts a two-level architecture in which a high-level autoregressive motion diffusion model continuously generates short-horizon kinematic trajectories conditioned on the current text input, while a low-level motion tracking policy executes these trajectories on a physical humanoid robot. By bridging interactive motion generation with robust whole-body control, TextOp unlocks free-form intent expression and enables smooth transitions across multiple challenging behaviors such as dancing and jumping, within a single continuous motion execution. Extensive real-robot experiments and offline evaluations demonstrate instant responsiveness, smooth whole-body motion, and precise control.

By prioritizing these low cosine similarity queries, the behavior of full attention during the prefill stage can be closely approximated. QUOKA leverages this observation, accelerating attention by (1) first retaining a small set of representative queries and (2) then subselectin the keys most aligned with those queries.

As our main result, we prove that the full WL hierarchy cannot, in general, distinguish between satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances. We show that indistinguishability under higher-order WL carries over to practical limitations for WL-bounded solvers that set variables sequentially. We further study the expressivity required for several important families of SAT instances, including regular, random and planar instances.

To address these limitations, we present VividFace, a real-time and realistic facial expression shadowing system for humanoid robots. An optimized imitation framework X2CNet++ enhances expressiveness by fine-tuning the human-to-humanoid facial motion transfer module and introducing a feature-adaptation training strategy for better alignment across different image sources. Real-time shadowing is further enabled by a video-stream-compatible inference pipeline and a streamlined workflow based on asynchronous I/O for efficient communication across devices. VividFace produces vivid humanoid faces by mimicking human facial expressions within 0.05 seconds, while generalizing across diverse facial configurations.

Existing approaches often struggle with flexible view configurations, including arbitrary view combinations, numbers of views, and heterogeneous modalities. Focusing on the context of human activity recognition, we propose RALIS, a model that combines multiview contrastive learning with a mixture-of-experts module to support arbitrary view availability during both training and inference. Instead of trying to reconstruct missing views, an adjusted center contrastive loss is used for self-supervised representation learning and view alignment, mitigating the impact of missing views on multiview fusion. This loss formulation allows for the integration of view weights to account for view quality. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity from $O(V^2)$ to $O(V)$, where $V$ is the number of views. To address residual discrepancies not captured by contrastive learning, we employ a mixture-of-experts module with a specialized load balancing strategy, tasked with adapting to arbitrary view combinations.

Unfortunately, existing local differentially private GNNs either only preserve link privacy or suffer significant utility loss in the process of preserving link and node feature privacy. In this paper, we propose an effective LDP framework, called HoGS, which trains GNNs with link and feature protection by generating a synthetic graph. Concretely, HoGS first collects the link and feature information of the graph under LDP, and then utilizes the phenomenon of homophily in graph data to reconstruct the graph structure and node features separately, thereby effectively mitigating the negative impact of LDP on the downstream GNN training.

However, single time-point segmentations fail to capture the biological heterogeneity and temporal evolution of stroke. We propose a bi-temporal analysis framework that characterizes ischemic tissue using statistical descriptors, radiomic texture features, and deep feature embeddings from two architectures (mJ-Net and nnU-Net). Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

While most BO pipelines begin with uniform random initialization, default hyperparameter values shipped with popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn encode implicit expert knowledge and could serve as informative starting points that accelerate convergence. This hypothesis, despite its intuitive appeal, has remained largely unexamined. We formalize the idea by initializing BO with points drawn from truncated Gaussian distributions centered at library defaults and compare the resulting trajectories against a uniform-random baseline. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation spanning three BO back-ends (BoTorch, Optuna, Scikit-Optimize), three model families (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptrons), and five benchmark datasets covering classification and regression tasks. Performance is assessed through convergence speed and final predictive quality, and statistical significance is determined via one-sided binomial tests. Across all conditions, default-informed initialization yields no statistically significant advantage over purely random sampling, with p-values ranging from 0.141 to 0.908. A sensitivity analysis on the prior variance confirms that, while tighter concentration around the defaults improves early evaluations, this transient benefit vanishes as optimization progresses, leaving final performance unchanged. Our results provide no evidence that default hyperparameters encode useful directional information for optimization. We therefore recommend that practitioners treat hyperparameter tuning as an integral part of model development and favor principled, data-driven search strategies over heuristic reliance on library defaults.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u5e93\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08BO\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u7ecf\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570BO\u7ba1\u9053\u4ece\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u800c\u6d41\u884c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e93\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u503c\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u4ee5\u5e93\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u622a\u65ad\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u62bd\u53d6\u7684\u70b9\u521d\u59cb\u5316BO\uff0c\u4e0e\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aBO\u540e\u7aef\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u4fa7\u4e8c\u9879\u5f0f\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4fe1\u606f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cp\u503c\u57280.141\u52300.908\u4e4b\u95f4\uff1b\u5bf9\u5148\u9a8c\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u65e9\u671f\u4f18\u52bf\u968f\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u5c06\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e93\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u3002"}}

Although larger models often yield better task performance and brain alignment, they are increasingly difficult to analyze mechanistically. This raises a fundamental question: what is the minimal model capacity required to capture brain-relevant representations? To address this question, we systematically investigate how constraining model scale and numerical precision affects brain alignment. We compare full-precision LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and compressed variants (quantized and pruned) by predicting fMRI responses during naturalistic language comprehension. Across model families up to 14B parameters, we find that 3B SLMs achieve brain predictivity indistinguishable from larger LLMs, whereas 1B models degrade substantially, particularly in semantic language regions. Brain alignment is remarkably robust to compression: most quantization and pruning methods preserve neural predictivity, with GPTQ as a consistent exception. Linguistic probing reveals a dissociation between task performance and brain predictivity: compression degrades discourse, syntax, and morphology, yet brain predictivity remains largely unchanged. Overall, brain alignment saturates at modest model scales and is resilient to compression, challenging common assumptions about neural scaling and motivating compact models for brain-aligned language modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9002\u5ea6\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u8111\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4e14\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u6709\u6297\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u53ca\u6240\u9700\u6700\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8111\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u538b\u7f29\u53d8\u4f53\u9884\u6d4bfMRI\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "3B\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8111\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c1B\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u8111\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u6709\u6297\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u795e\u7ecf\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0cGPTQ\u9664\u5916\uff1b\u8bed\u8a00\u63a2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u8111\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8111\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u9002\u5ea6\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u9971\u548c\u4e14\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u6709\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u795e\u7ecf\u6269\u5c55\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This study investigates the intrinsic few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) capabilities of frozen DINOv3 features through a training-free baseline, FSSDINO, utilizing class-specific prototypes and Gram-matrix refinement. Our results across binary, multi-class, and cross-domain (CDFSS) benchmarks demonstrate that this minimal approach, applied to the final backbone layer, is highly competitive with specialized methods involving complex decoders or test-time adaptation. Crucially, we conduct an Oracle-guided layer analysis, identifying a significant performance gap between the standard last-layer features and globally optimal intermediate representations. We reveal a \"Safest vs. Optimal\" dilemma: while the Oracle proves higher performance is attainable, matching the results of compute-intensive adaptation methods, current unsupervised and support-guided selection metrics consistently yield lower performance than the last-layer baseline. This characterizes a \"Semantic Selection Gap\" in Foundation Models, a disconnect where traditional heuristics fail to reliably identify high-fidelity features. Our work establishes the \"Last-Layer\" as a deceptively strong baseline and provides a rigorous diagnostic of the latent semantic potentials in DINOv3.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/hussni0997/fssdino.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7FSSDINO\u63a2\u7a76\u51bb\u7ed3DINOv3\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u9009\u62e9\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u51bb\u7ed3DINOv3\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u7ebfFSSDINO\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u539f\u578b\u548cGram\u77e9\u9635\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884cOracle\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u6700\u540e\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u201c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u201d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5bf9DINOv3\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6f5c\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u8bca\u65ad\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce How2Everything, a scalable framework to evaluate and improve goal-conditioned procedure generation. Our framework includes How2Mine, which mines 351K procedures from 980K web pages across 14 topics and readily scales to larger corpora. From this pool we build How2Bench, a 7K-example evaluation set balanced across topics. To reliably score model outputs, we develop How2Score, an evaluation protocol that uses an LLM judge to detect whether a generation contains any critical failure that would prevent achieving the goal. For low-cost, reproducible evaluation, we distill a frontier model into an open 8B model, achieving 80.5% agreement with human annotators. How2Bench reveals clear scaling trends across model sizes and training stages, providing signal early in pretraining. Finally, RL using How2Score as a reward improves performance on How2Bench by >10 points across three models without systematic regressions on standard benchmarks, with gains robust to superficial source-document memorization or format compliance.

While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras.

Yet even small downstream updates can compromise earlier learned behaviors (e.g., safety), exposing a brittleness known as catastrophic forgetting. This suggests standard RLHF objectives do not guarantee robustness to future adaptation. To address it, most prior work designs downstream-time methods to preserve previously learned behaviors. We argue that preventing this requires pre-finetuning robustness: the base policy should avoid brittle high-reward solutions whose reward drops sharply under standard fine-tuning.\n  We propose Fine-tuning Robust Policy Optimization (FRPO), a robust RLHF framework that optimizes reward not only at the current policy, but across a KL-bounded neighborhood of policies reachable by downstream adaptation. The key idea is to ensure reward stability under policy shifts via a max-min formulation. By modifying GRPO, we develop an algorithm with no extra computation, and empirically show it substantially reduces safety degradation across multiple base models and downstream fine-tuning regimes (SFT and RL) while preserving downstream task performance.

This study investigates how the temporal context length of video clips (3--12 s clips) and the narrative-task prompting shape brain-model alignment during naturalistic movie watching. Using fMRI recordings from participants viewing full-length movies, we examine how brain regions sensitive to narrative context dynamically represent information over varying timescales and how these neural patterns align with model-derived features. We find that increasing clip duration substantially improves brain alignment for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), whereas unimodal video models show little to no gain. Further, shorter temporal windows align with perceptual and early language regions, while longer windows preferentially align higher-order integrative regions, mirrored by a layer-to-cortex hierarchy in MLLMs. Finally, narrative-task prompts (multi-scene summary, narrative summary, character motivation, and event boundary detection) elicit task-specific, region-dependent brain alignment patterns and context-dependent shifts in clip-level tuning in higher-order regions. Together, our results position long-form narrative movies as a principled testbed for probing biologically relevant temporal integration and interpretable representations in long-context MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u65f6\u957f\u4e0e\u53d9\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5927\u8111\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u53ca\u53d9\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u53d9\u4e8b\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf\uff08fMRI\uff09\u8bb0\u5f55\u89c2\u770b\u5168\u957f\u5ea6\u7535\u5f71\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5927\u8111\u533a\u57df\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8868\u5f81\u53ca\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u589e\u52a0\u7247\u6bb5\u65f6\u957f\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5927\u8111\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u957f\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u8111\u533a\u5bf9\u5e94\uff1b\u53d9\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u53d1\u7279\u5b9a\u8111\u533a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8c03\u8c10\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u957f\u5f62\u5f0f\u53d9\u4e8b\u7535\u5f71\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u751f\u7269\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u95f4\u6574\u5408\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Conversely, spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency due to their binary and event-driven characteristics, thus motivating the study of ANN-to-SNN conversion. In this process, quantization plays a pivotal role, mapping LLMs' floating-point parameters to discrete SNN parameters via the temporal dimension of the time window. However, several challenges remain in the conversion process: (i) converting high bit-width quantization values into binary spikes requires longer time windows, increasing system latency; and (ii) the inherent trade-off between the information loss of single-spike schemes and the energy costs of multi-spike ones in SNN. To address these challenges, we propose Kirin, a integer and spike hybrid based SNN to achieve accuracy lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion with time and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first propose a Spike Matrix Hybridization strategy that encoding low bit-width parameters that leading to small time window size into binary spikes while preserving the rest in integer format, thereby reducing the overall latency of SNN execution. Second, we introduce a silence threshold mechanism to regulate the timing of single-spike firing, ensuring the output is mathematically equivalent to the LLM's output and preserves accuracy.

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5730\u8d28\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u81ea\u52a8\u7ed8\u5236\u5ca9\u77f3\u8282\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u8d28\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u8282\u7406\u7ed8\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5ca9\u77f3\u8282\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u8d28\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\uff1b\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u88c2\u7f1d\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8282\u7406\u5ca9\u77f3\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u76d1\u7763\u8282\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff1b\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8282\u7406\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Here, we introduce FlexMoRE, a Flexible Mixture of Rank-heterogenous Experts, which may be either full-sized experts or adapters of a suitable rank. We systematically investigate the trade-off between expert rank and downstream task performance by evaluating $6$ experts with ranks $2^0$ to $2^{14}$ resulting in experiments covering 150 mixtures (96 with 2 experts, 54 with 7 experts) that are evaluated across $120$ tasks. For our experiments, we build on FlexOlmo and turn its pre-trained experts into low-rank versions. Our regression analysis from expert rank to downstream task performance reveals that the best-performing rank is substantially higher for reasoning-heavy benchmarks than for knowledge-heavy benchmarks. These findings on rank sensitivity come with direct implications for memory efficiency: Using optimal ranks, FlexMoRE yields improved downstream task performance (average score $47.18$) compared to the baseline FlexOlmo-style mixture of full-sized experts (average score $45.46$) at less than one third the parameters ($10.75$B for FlexMoRE vs. $33.27$B for FlexOlmo).

As RL is increasingly applied to settings such as verifiable rewards and multi-objective alignment, RMs are expected to encode more complex and multifaceted preference distributions. However, classifier RMs remain static once trained, limiting their adaptability at test time. We propose Variational In-Context Reward Modeling (ICRM), a novel Bayesian reward modeling objective that enables test-time steerability via in-context preference demonstrations. ICRM casts reward modeling as amortized variational inference over a latent preference probability under the Bradley-Terry model using a conjugate Beta prior. We show that ICRM adapt to unseen preference distributions at test time for both single and multi-objective settings. With more in-context demonstrations, ICRM gains 34% accuracy on SafeRLHF and 9% accuracy on RM-Bench in the single-objective setting, while widening the Pareto frontier with a 4% gain in hypervolume on helpfulness and refusal benchmarks. We further study the practical applicability of ICRM for RL training, showing that it can effectively encode verifiable rewards by outperforming a conventional RM in math reasoning.

In this work, we theoretically pinpoint a key reason for training instability when extending group-based RL to multi-agent LLM systems. We show that under GRPO-style optimization, a global normalization baseline may deviate from diverse agents' reward distributions, which ultimately leads to gradient-norm instability. Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, a simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agent's own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends. We evaluate Dr. MAS on multi-agent math reasoning and multi-turn search benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 series models.

In this work, we focus on a prevalent yet under-explored phenomenon in graph generalization, Minimal Shift Flip (MSF),where test samples that slightly deviate from the training distribution are abruptly misclassified. To interpret this phenomenon, we revisit MSF through the lens of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which characterizes the local stability and sharpness of the loss landscape while providing a theoretical foundation for modeling generalization error. To quantify loss sharpness, we introduce the concept of Local Robust Radius, measuring the smallest perturbation required to flip a prediction and establishing a theoretical link between local stability and generalization. Building on this perspective, we further observe a continual decrease in the robust radius during training, indicating weakened local stability and an increasingly sharp loss landscape that gives rise to MSF. To jointly solve the MSF phenomenon and the intractability of radius, we develop an energy-based formulation that is theoretically proven to be monotonically correlated with the robust radius, offering a tractable and principled objective for modeling flatness and stability. Building on these insights, we propose an energy-driven generative augmentation framework (E2A) that leverages energy-guided latent perturbations to generate pseudo-OOD samples and enhance model generalization.

The models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/StevenHH2000/fine-r1", "summary": "Any entity in the visual world can be hierarchically grouped based on shared characteristics and mapped to fine-grained sub-categories. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

However, despite excelling at general search, existing agents often struggle to bridge the cognitive gap between pixel-level perception and high-level marketing logic. To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy.

While allocation policies aim to maximize population-level outcomes, current approaches often fail to account for the dynamic arrival of organs and the composition of waitlisted candidates, thereby hampering efficiency. The United States is transitioning from rigid, rule-based allocation to more flexible data-driven models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for non-myopic policy optimization in general online matching relying on potentials, a concept originally introduced for kidney exchange. We develop scalable and accurate ways of learning potentials that are higher-dimensional and more expressive than prior approaches. Our approach is a form of self-supervised imitation learning: the potentials are trained to mimic an omniscient algorithm that has perfect foresight. We focus on the application of heart transplant allocation and demonstrate, using real historical data, that our policies significantly outperform prior approaches -- including the current US status quo policy and the proposed continuous distribution framework -- in optimizing for population-level outcomes. Our analysis and methods come at a pivotal moment in US policy, as the current heart transplant allocation system is under review.

Amortized SR promises to be much more efficient than the predominant genetic programming SR methods, but currently struggles to scale to realistic scientific complexity. We find that a key obstacle is the lack of a fast reduction of equivalent expressions to a concise normalized form. Amortized SR has addressed this by general-purpose Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) like SymPy, but the high computational cost severely limits training and inference speed. We propose SimpliPy, a rule-based simplification engine achieving a 100-fold speed-up over SymPy at comparable quality. This enables substantial improvements in amortized SR, including scalability to much larger training sets, more efficient use of the per-expression token budget, and systematic training set decontamination with respect to equivalent test expressions. We demonstrate these advantages in our Flash-ANSR framework, which achieves much better accuracy than amortized baselines (NeSymReS, E2E) on the FastSRB benchmark.

Drawing on design documents, source code, execution traces, and discussions with organizers and competing teams, we examine the competition's structure and key design decisions, characterize the architectural approaches of finalist CRSs, and analyze competition results beyond the final scoreboard. Our analysis reveals the factors that truly drove CRS performance, identifies genuine technical advances achieved by teams, and exposes limitations that remain open for future research. We conclude with lessons for organizing future competitions and broader insights toward deploying autonomous CRSs in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9DARPA\u7684AIxCC\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f71\u54cdCRS\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u56e2\u961f\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u5f85\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7ed9\u51fa\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ade\u8d5b\u548c\u90e8\u7f72CRS\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "DARPA\u7684AIxCC\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f51\u7edc\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5927\u578b\u7ade\u8d5b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u52a9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u6863\u3001\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8005\u548c\u53c2\u8d5b\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u5f71\u54cdCRS\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u56e2\u961f\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u5f85\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f97\u51fa\u7ec4\u7ec7\u672a\u6765\u7ade\u8d5b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u81ea\u4e3bCRS\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., \"turn after that red building\") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient. Challenges include ambient noise interference, privacy considerations, and robustness across human subjects, motivating further work on reliability in dynamic real-world contexts.

Existing mitigation methods apply interventions uniformly, degrading performance on the majority of tokens that generalize normally. We show empirically that memorization is sparse, intermittent, and token-conditioned, suggesting that effective mitigation requires context-aware intervention rather than static parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel and effective selective memorization mitigation method -- Gated Subspace Steering (GSS), which decomposes intervention into a probe (detecting memorization-relevant activations) and a steer (applying targeted correction only when the probe exceeds a threshold). The optimal probe-steer pair emerges from a principled optimization framework based on optimal subspace steering. Experiments on four benchmarks show GSS matches or exceeds state-of-the-art memorization reduction while requiring $100-1000 \\times$ less compute than optimization-based alternatives.

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u4e2a\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\u9700\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u878d\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7ba1\u9053\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u652f\u6301\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7528\u4f8b\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u56fe\u50cf - \u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5371\u9669\u7b5b\u67e5\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u4e09\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5371\u9669\u7b5b\u67e5\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u6837\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u7684\u9053\u8def\u5371\u9669\uff1b\u76f4\u63a5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u4e0d\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u8f68\u8ff9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u4e25\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u7cca\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u8fbe\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\u662f\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u6ce8\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Motivated by MODIS vegetation index studies, we examine predictors from spectral bands, productivity and energy fluxes, observation geometry, and land surface characteristics. Because these relationships vary with canopy structure, climate, land use, and measurement conditions, methods should both model spatially varying effects and identify where predictors matter. We propose a spatially varying coefficient model where each coefficient surface uses a tensor product B-spline basis and a Bayesian group lasso prior on the basis coefficients. This prior induces predictor level shrinkage, pushing negligible effects toward zero while preserving spatial structure. Posterior inference uses Markov chain Monte Carlo and provides uncertainty quantification for each effect surface. We summarize retained effects with spatial significance maps that mark locations where the 95 percent posterior credible interval excludes zero, and we define a spatial coverage probability as the proportion of locations where the credible interval excludes zero. Simulations recover sparsity and achieve prediction. A MODIS application yields a parsimonious subset of predictors whose effect maps clarify dominant controls across landscapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u7cfb\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u79efB\u6837\u6761\u57fa\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7ec4\u5957\u7d22\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u73af\u5883\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0e\u690d\u88ab\u72b6\u51b5\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u73af\u5883\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u690d\u88ab\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u65e0\u5173\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u7cfb\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u6570\u8868\u9762\u4f7f\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u79efB\u6837\u6761\u57fa\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7ec4\u5957\u7d22\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u540e\u9a8c\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cMODIS\u5e94\u7528\u5f97\u5230\u7b80\u7ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u6548\u5e94\u56fe\u660e\u786e\u666f\u89c2\u4e3b\u5bfc\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u73af\u5883\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0e\u690d\u88ab\u72b6\u51b5\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002"}}

We introduce StealthRL, a reinforcement learning framework that stress-tests detector robustness under realistic adversarial conditions. StealthRL trains a paraphrase policy against a multi-detector ensemble using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with LoRA adapters on Qwen3-4B, optimizing a composite reward that balances detector evasion with semantic preservation. We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate. Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals.

PoT interleaves (i) temporal evidence selection, (ii) step-wise state updates, and (iii) constrained answer synthesis, enabling the model to progressively refine hypotheses while maintaining traceability to video evidence. The framework is designed to be model-agnostic and can be plugged into existing vision-language backbones, supporting both closed-book reasoning and evidence-augmented reasoning with external tools.

We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection.

SyPE strictly generalizes RoPE by extending the rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ to the symplectic group $\\mathrm{Sp}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, modulated by a novel input-dependent adaptive warp module. By allowing the attention mechanism to adaptively dilate or contract temporal coordinates end-to-end, our approach captures locally varying periodicities without requiring pre-defined warping functions.

To address this, we propose a weighted loss objective for neural networks that combines node-wise imbalance weighting with focal weighting components, the latter leveraging modern quantification of ensemble uncertainties. By emphasizing rare nodes rather than rare observations (data points), and focusing on uncertain nodes for each model output distribution during training, we observe improvements in recall by up to a factor of five on benchmark datasets, along with statistically significant gains in $F_{1}$ score.

Existing routers typically rely on non-differentiable Top-$k$+Softmax, limiting their performance and scalability. We argue that two distinct decisions, which experts to activate and how to distribute expert contributions among them, are conflated in standard Top-$k$+Softmax. We introduce Dirichlet-Routed MoE (DirMoE), a novel end-to-end differentiable routing mechanism built on a Dirichlet variational autoencoder framework. This design fundamentally disentangles the core routing problems: expert selection, modeled by a Bernoulli component, and expert contribution among chosen experts, handled by a Dirichlet component.

We present \\textbf{Adaptively Rotated Optimization (ARO}, a new matrix optimization framework that treats gradient rotation as a first class design principle. ARO accelerates LLM training by performing normed steepest descent in a rotated coordinate system, where the rotation is determined by a novel norm-informed policy. This perspective yields update rules that go beyond existing orthogonalization and whitening optimizers, improving sample efficiency in practice. To make comparisons reliable, we propose a rigorously controlled benchmarking protocol that reduces confounding and bias. Under this protocol, ARO consistently outperforms AdamW (by 1.3 $\\sim$1.35$\\times$) and orthogonalization methods (by 1.1$\\sim$1.15$\\times$) in LLM pretraining at up to 8B activated parameters, and up to $8\\times$ overtrain budget, without evidence of diminishing returns.

This paper revisits the default mechanism for deepening neural networks, namely residual connections, from an optimization perspective.

While recent work has identified structured, human-like conceptual representations within these models, it remains unclear whether they functionally rely on such representations for reasoning.

Our results reveal a conceptual subspace emerging in middle to late layers, whose representational structure persists across contexts. Using causal mediation analyses, we demonstrate that this subspace is not merely an epiphenomenon but is functionally central to model predictions, establishing its causal role in inference. We further identify a layer-wise progression where attention heads in early-to-middle layers integrate contextual cues to construct and refine the subspace, which is subsequently leveraged by later layers to generate predictions.

To address this, recent agentic thinking-with-videos paradigms have emerged, adopting a localize-clip-answer pipeline in which the model actively identifies relevant video segments, performs dense sampling within those clips, and then produces answers. However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning stage, we design a unified masking mechanism that encourages exploration while preventing noise.

Layer-wise pruning, a commonly employed strategy to mitigate inference costs, can partially address this challenge. However, existing approaches generally depend on static heuristic rules and fail to account for the interdependencies among layers, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the pruning process. To this end, this paper proposes a game-theoretic framework that formulates layer pruning as a cooperative game in which each layer acts as a player and model performance serves as the utility. As computing exact Shapley values is computationally infeasible for large language models (LLMs), we propose using a lightweight surrogate network to estimate layer-wise marginal contributions. This network can predict LLM performance for arbitrary layer combinations at a low computational cost. Additionally, we employ stratified Monte Carlo mask sampling to further reduce the cost of Sharpley value estimation. This approach captures inter-layer dependencies and dynamically identifies critical layers for pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of our method in terms of perplexity and zero-shot accuracy, achieving more efficient and effective layer-wise pruning for large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u63a9\u7801\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u5c42\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u526a\u679d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\uff1b\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u4f30\u8ba1\u5c42\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u63a9\u7801\u91c7\u6837\u964d\u4f4e\u590f\u666e\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u3002"}}

X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) coupled with numerical simulations is commonly used to investigate the multiphase flow behaviors in carbonate rocks. Carbonates exhibit pore size distribution across scales, hindering the comprehensive investigation with conventional X-ray CT images. Imaging samples at both macro and micro-scales (multi-scale imaging) proved to be a viable option in this context. However, multi-scale imaging faces two key limitations: the trade-off between field of view and voxel size necessitates resource-intensive imaging, while multi-scale multi-physics numerical simulations on resulting digital models incur prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a machine learning-enhanced data assimilation framework that leverages experimental drainage relative permeability measurements to achieve efficient characterization of micro-scale structures, delivering a data-driven solution toward a high-fidelity multiscale digital rock modeling. We train a dense neural network (DNN) as a proxy to a multi-scale pore network simulator and couple it with an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) algorithm.

Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models.

Because LLM inference is inherently expensive, even modest slowdowns can translate into substantial operating costs and severe availability risks. Recently, a growing body of research has focused on algorithmic complexity attacks by crafting inputs to trigger worst-case output lengths. However, we report a counter-intuitive finding that these algorithmic latency attacks are largely ineffective against modern LLM serving systems. We reveal that system-level optimization such as continuous batching provides a logical isolation to mitigate contagious latency impact on co-located users. To this end, in this paper, we shift the focus from the algorithm to the system layer, and introduce a new Fill and Squeeze attack strategy targeting the state transition of the scheduler. \"Fill\" first exhausts the global KV cache to induce Head-of-Line blocking, while \"Squeeze\" forces the system into repetitive preemption. By manipulating output lengths using methods from simple plain-text prompts to more complex prompt engineering, and leveraging side-channel probing of memory status, we demonstrate that the attack can be orchestrated in a black-box setting with much less cost. Extensive evaluations indicate by up to 20-280x average slowdown on Time to First Token and 1.5-4x average slowdown on Time Per Output Token compared to existing attacks with 30-40% lower attack cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u5ef6\u8fdf\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u7684Fill and Squeeze\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u5ef6\u8fdf\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFill and Squeeze\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8017\u5c3d\u5168\u5c40KV\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u8feb\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cd\u590d\u62a2\u5360\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u64cd\u7eb5\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u63a2\u6d4b\u5185\u5b58\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8be5\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u4f7fTime to First Token\u5e73\u5747\u616220 - 280\u500d\uff0cTime Per Output Token\u5e73\u5747\u61621.5 - 4\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e30 - 40%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Fill and Squeeze\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002"}}

This paper introduces Deep Variable-Length Feedback (DeepVLF) coding, a flexible coding framework that dynamically adjusts transmission length via learned feedback. We propose two complementary architectures: DeepVLF-R, where termination is receiver-driven, and DeepVLF-T, where the transmitter controls termination. Both architectures leverage bit-group partitioning and transformer-based encoder-decoder networks to enable fine-grained rate adaptation in response to feedback. Evaluations over AWGN and 5G-NR fading channels demonstrate that DeepVLF substantially outperforms state-of-the-art learned feedback codes. It achieves the same block error rate with 20%-55% fewer channel uses and lowers error floors by orders of magnitude, particularly in high-rate regimes. Encoding dynamics analysis further reveals that the models autonomously learn a two-phase strategy analogous to classical Schalkwijk-Kailath coding: an initial information-carrying phase followed by a noise-cancellation refinement phase. This emergent behavior underscores the interpretability and information-theoretic alignment of the learned codes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDeepVLF\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f20\u8f93\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7801\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u5757\u957f\u3001\u9ad8\u7801\u7387\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6f5c\u529b\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeepVLF\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u7ec8\u7aef\u7684DeepVLF - R\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u7ec8\u7aef\u7684DeepVLF - T\u4e24\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4d\u7ec4\u5212\u5206\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728AWGN\u548c5G - NR\u8870\u843d\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\uff0cDeepVLF\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1120% - 55%\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u7801\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7801\u7387\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepVLF\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7801\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\uff0c\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f20\u8f93\u957f\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u3002"}}

We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction.

While Internet videos offer virtually unlimited raw data, utilizing them as a scaling source for geometric learning is challenging due to the absence of ground-truth geometry and the presence of observational noise. To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization strategy using anchor data. Extensive experiments show that SAGE significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, reducing Chamfer Distance by 20-42% on unseen benchmarks (7Scenes, TUM-RGBD, Matterport3D) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Existing AI-based methods primarily treat diagnosis as a visual pattern recognition task and do not reflect the structured clinical reasoning used by dental professionals.

To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline.

By utilizing the VLM's existing visual-linguistic capabilities, OMNI-Dent aims to support diagnostic assessment in settings where curated clinical imaging is unavailable.

The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42Shapley\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5ShapBPT\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5c42Shapley\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u6162\u3001\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f31\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ShapBPT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06Shapley\u7cfb\u6570\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u9002\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u2014\u2014\u4e8c\u53c9\u5206\u533a\u6811\uff08BPT\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u533a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eShapBPT\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u66f4\u597d\u3001\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u9752\u7750\u3002", "conclusion": "ShapBPT\u5c06\u5206\u5c42Shapley\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The fidelity of these maps is paramount, as an accurate environmental representation is a prerequisite for stable and precise localization. Factor graphs provide a powerful approach for sensor fusion, enabling the estimation of the maximum a posteriori solution. However, the discrete nature of graph-based representations, combined with asynchronous sensor measurements, complicates consistent state estimation. The design of an optimal factor graph topology remains an open challenge, especially in multi-sensor systems with asynchronous data. Conventional approaches rely on a rigid graph structure, which becomes inefficient with sensors of disparate rates. Although preintegration techniques can mitigate this for high-rate sensors, their applicability is limited. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel approach that incrementally constructs connected factor graphs, ensuring the incorporation of all available sensor data by choosing the optimal graph topology based on the external evaluation criteria.

This paper formulates the Human-Robot Co-Dispatch Facility Location Problem (HRCD-FLP), a capacitated facility location variant incorporating tiered infrastructure criticality, human-robot supervision ratio constraints, and minimum utilization requirements. We evaluate command center selection across three technology maturity scenarios. Results show transitioning from conservative (1:3 human-robot supervision) to future autonomous operations (1:10) yields significant cost reduction while maintaining complete critical infrastructure coverage. For small problems, exact methods dominate in both cost and computation time; for larger problems, the proposed heuristic achieves feasible solutions in under 3 minutes with approximately 14% optimality gap where comparison is possible.

Translation is often used as a shortcut to probe multilingual behavior, but it rarely captures the full picture, especially when harmful intent or structure morphs across languages. Some types of harm survive translation almost intact, while others distort or disappear. To study this effect, we introduce CompositeHarm, a translation-based benchmark designed to examine how safety alignment holds up as both syntax and semantics shift. It combines two complementary English datasets, AttaQ, which targets structured adversarial attacks, and MMSafetyBench, which covers contextual, real-world harms, and extends them into six languages: English, Hindi, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, and Gujarati. Using three large models, we find that attack success rates rise sharply in Indic languages, especially under adversarial syntax, while contextual harms transfer more moderately. To ensure scalability and energy efficiency, our study adopts lightweight inference strategies inspired by edge-AI design principles, reducing redundant evaluation passes while preserving cross-lingual fidelity. This design makes large-scale multilingual safety testing both computationally feasible and environmentally conscious.

To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics.

Miller", "Wenchuan Wu"], "title": "High-fidelity 3D multi-slab diffusion MRI using Slab-shifting for Harmonized 3D Acquisition and Reconstruction with Profile Encoding Networks (SHARPEN)", "categories": ["physics.med-ph", "cs.LG"], "comment": "26 pages, 11 figures + supplementary info", "summary": "Three-dimensional (3D) multi-slab imaging is a promising approach for high-resolution in vivo diffusion MRI (dMRI) due to its compatibility with short TR (1-2 s), providing optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. A major challenge, however, is slab boundary artifacts arising from non-ideal slab-selective RF excitation. Non-rectangular slab profiles reduce signal intensity at slab boundaries, while profile overlap across adjacent slabs introduces inter-slab crosstalk, where repeated excitation shortens the local TR and limits T1 recovery. To mitigate slab boundary artifacts without increasing scan time, we build on slab profile encoding and propose Slab-shifting for Harmonized 3D Acquisition and Reconstruction with Profile Encoding Networks (SHARPEN). For different diffusion directions, SHARPEN applies inter-volume field-of-view shifts along the slice direction to provide complementary slab profile encoding without prolonging acquisition. Slab profiles are estimated using a lightweight self-supervised neural network that exploits consistency across shifted acquisitions and known physical properties of slab profiles and diffusion images, and corrected images are reconstructed accordingly. SHARPEN was validated using simulated and prospectively acquired high-resolution in vivo data and demonstrates accurate slab profile estimation and robust boundary artifact correction, even in the presence of inter-volume motion.

Empirical analysis across several benchmarks reveals that our proposed uncertainty quantification reliably indicates system failures, which demonstrates the validity of using them as diagnostic metrics to indicate the system failure. Subsequently, we propose a mitigation strategy by formulating an uncertainty-driven policy optimization to penalize self-contradiction, peer conflict, and low-confidence outputs in a dynamic debating environment.

Instead of discarding tokens, DeltaKV encodes semantic residuals relative to retrieved historical references, preserving fidelity while substantially reducing storage. To translate compression gains into real system speedups, we further introduce Sparse-vLLM, a high-performance inference engine with decoupled memory management and kernels optimized for sparse and irregular KV layouts. Experiments show that DeltaKV reduces KV cache memory to 29\\% of the original while maintaining near-lossless accuracy on LongBench, SCBench, and AIME. When integrated with Sparse-vLLM, it achieves up to 2$\\times$ throughput improvement over vLLM in long-context scenarios, demonstrating a practical path toward scalable long-context LLM deployment.

Existing vision-based occupancy forecasting methods focus on motion-related categories such as static and dynamic objects, while semantic information remains largely absent. Recent semantic occupancy forecasting approaches address this gap but rely on past occupancy predictions obtained from separate networks. This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons.

Existing access control is static and centralized, unable to adapt to insider threats or evolving contexts. Blockchain improves decentralization but lacks behavioral intelligence, while centralized machine learning for anomaly detection requires aggregating sensitive data, violating privacy.\n  The proposed solution is ICBAC, an intelligent contract-based access control framework. It integrates permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) with federated learning (FL). Built on Fabric, ICBAC uses a multi-channel architecture and three smart contracts for asset management, baseline access control, and dynamic revocation. To counter insider misuse, each channel deploys an AI agent that monitors activity and dynamically restricts access for anomalies. Federated learning allows these agents to collaboratively improve detection models without sharing raw data.\n  For heterogeneous, competitive environments, ICBAC introduces a game-theoretic client selection mechanism using hedonic coalition formation. This enables supply chains to form stable, strategy-proof FL coalitions via preference-based selection without disclosing sensitive criteria. Extensive experiments on a Fabric testbed with a real-world dataset show ICBAC achieves blockchain performance comparable to static frameworks and provides effective anomaly detection under IID and non-IID data with zero raw-data sharing. ICBAC thus offers a practical, scalable solution for dynamic, privacy-preserving access control in decentralized supply chains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faICBAC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e0e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u9759\u6001\u3001\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5185\u90e8\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7f3a\u4e4f\u884c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4fb5\u72af\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faICBAC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8bb8\u53ef\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u901a\u9053\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72AI\u4ee3\u7406\u76d1\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728Fabric\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cICBAC\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u4e0b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "ICBAC\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As AVs operate in safety-critical environments, understanding their robustness in an adversarial environment is an important research problem. Prior physical adversarial attacks on vision-based autonomous vehicles predominantly target immediate safety failures (e.g., a crash, a traffic-rule violation, or a transient lane departure) by inducing a short-lived perception or control error. This paper shows a qualitatively different risk: a long-horizon route integrity compromise, where an attacker gradually steers a victim AV away from its intended route and into an attacker-chosen destination while the victim continues to drive \"normally.\" This will not pose a danger to the victim vehicle itself, but also to potential passengers sitting inside the vehicle.\n  In this paper, we design and implement the first adversarial framework, called JackZebra, that performs route-level hijacking of a vision-based end-to-end driving stack using a physically plausible attacker vehicle with a reconfigurable display mounted on the rear. The central challenge is temporal persistence: adversarial influence must remain effective in changing viewpoints, lighting, weather, traffic, and the victim's continual replanning -- without triggering conspicuous failures. Our key insight is to treat route hijacking as a closed-loop control problem and to convert adversarial patches into steering primitives that can be selected online via an interactive adjustment loop. Our adversarial patches are also carefully designed against worst-case background and sensor variations so that the adversarial impacts on the victim. Our evaluation shows that JackZebra can successfully hijack victim vehicles to deviate from original routes and stop at adversarial destinations with a high success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u8def\u7ebf\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0JackZebra\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8def\u7ebf\u52ab\u6301\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u653b\u51fb\u591a\u4e3a\u5373\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u8def\u7ebf\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1JackZebra\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e26\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u663e\u793a\u5c4f\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u5c06\u8def\u7ebf\u52ab\u6301\u89c6\u4e3a\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u5728\u7ebf\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8f6c\u5411\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "result": "JackZebra\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u52ab\u6301\u53d7\u5bb3\u8f66\u8f86\u504f\u79bb\u539f\u8def\u7ebf\u5e76\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u505c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684JackZebra\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u52ab\u6301\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u8def\u7ebf\u52ab\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision.

To address this gap, we introduce MIND, the first open-domain closed-loop revisited benchmark for evaluating Memory consIstency and action coNtrol in worlD models. MIND contains 250 high-quality videos at 1080p and 24 FPS, including 100 (first-person) + 100 (third-person) video clips under a shared action space and 25 + 25 clips across varied action spaces covering eight diverse scenes. We design an efficient evaluation framework to measure two core abilities: memory consistency and action control, capturing temporal stability and contextual coherence across viewpoints. Furthermore, we design various action spaces, including different character movement speeds and camera rotation angles, to evaluate the action generalization capability across different action spaces under shared scenes. To facilitate future performance benchmarking on MIND, we introduce MIND-World, a novel interactive Video-to-World baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the completeness of MIND and reveal key challenges in current world models, including the difficulty of maintaining long-term memory consistency and generalizing across action spaces.

We introduce Cross-View World Models (XVWM), trained with a cross-view prediction objective: given a sequence of frames from one viewpoint, predict the future state from the same or a different viewpoint after an action is taken. Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations. Finally, predicting the consequences of one's actions from another viewpoint may offer a foundation for perspective-taking in multi-agent settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08XVWM\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5e76\u884c\u60f3\u8c61\uff0c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u62e9\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u89d2\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f\u89c4\u5212\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u5982\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u9e1f\u77b0\u89c6\u89d2\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165XVWM\uff0c\u4ee5\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728Aimlabs\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u4ece\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u52a8\u540e\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We present a filtering and segmentation algorithm for detecting precipitates in FIB cross-section micrographs, optimized using linear genetic programming (LGP), which accounts for the various artifacts. To this end, the optimization environment uses a domain-specific language for image processing to iterate on solutions. Programs in this language are a list of image-filtering blocks with tunable parameters that sequentially process an input image, allowing for reliable generation and mutation by a genetic algorithm. Our environment produces optimized human-interpretable MATLAB code representing an image filtering pipeline. Under ideal conditions--a population size of 60 and a maximum program length of 5 blocks--our system was able to find a near-human accuracy solution with an average evaluation error of 1.8% when comparing segmentations pixel-by-pixel to a human baseline using an XOR error evaluation. Our automation work enabled faster iteration cycles and furthered exploration of the material composition and processing space: our optimized pipeline algorithm processes a 3.6 megapixel image in about 2 seconds on average.

First, YOLO 11x detects and crops human portraits frame-by-frame, and DINOv2-Base extracts visual features from the cropped regions. Next, by integrating Chain-of-Thought and Reflection prompting (CoT + Reflection), Gemini 2.5 Pro automatically generates pseudo-labels and reasoning texts that serve as weak supervision for downstream models. Subsequently, OpenPose produces 137-dimensional key-point sequences, augmented with inter-frame offset features; the usual graph neural network backbone is simplified to an MLP to efficiently model the spatiotemporal relationships of the three key-point streams. An ultra-long-sequence Transformer independently encodes both the image and key-point sequences, and their representations are concatenated with BERT-encoded interview transcripts.

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7ba1\u9053Picasso\u548cPicasso\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cYCB - V\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b58\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7ba1\u9053Picasso\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u63a5\u89e6\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u63d0\u51faPicasso\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cYCB - V\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cPicasso\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "Picasso\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e2\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u53c8\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u6846\u67b6DICE\u5b9e\u73b0\u5373\u65f6\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\u64e6\u9664\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u98ce\u683c\u64e6\u9664\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6291\u5236\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u5bb9\u6613\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u7248\u6743\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u7b56\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u53ef\u9760\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u5c06\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u975e\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5c06\u89e3\u7f20\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u8bc6\u522b\u98ce\u683c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u8026\u7f16\u8f91\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "DICE\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u64e6\u9664\u5f7b\u5e95\u6027\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u89e3\u7f20\u98ce\u683c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a03\u79d2\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "DICE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6291\u5236\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Heuristic pruning methods are efficient but sensitive to activation outliers, while reconstruction-based approaches improve fidelity at the cost of heavy computation. In this work, we propose a lightweight post-training pruning framework based on first-order statistical properties of model weights and activations. During pruning, channel-wise statistics are used to calibrate magnitude-based importance scores, reducing bias from activation-dominated channels. After pruning, we apply an analytic energy compensation to correct distributional distortions caused by weight removal. Both steps operate without retraining, gradients, or second-order information. Experiments across multiple LLM families, sparsity patterns, and evaluation tasks show that the proposed approach improves pruning performance while maintaining computational cost comparable to heuristic methods.

We introduce a space-time regularization framework that couples spatial regularization with a learned temporal Fields-of-Experts (FoE) prior to capture complex spatiotemporal activation patterns. We derive a finite element discretization on unstructured cardiac surface meshes, prove Mosco-convergence, and develop a scalable optimization algorithm capable of handling the FoE term.

We first conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that combining intermediate-layer embeddings with a calibrated MLLM head yields strong zero-shot retrieval performance without any training. Building on these findings, we introduce a lightweight text-based alignment strategy which maps dense video captions to short summaries and enables task-related video-text embedding learning without visual supervision.

To address this issue, we propose an LLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment method (LGDEA), which shifts the pretraining objective toward evidence-level alignment that is more consistent with the medical diagnostic process. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract key diagnostic evidence from radiology reports and construct a shared diagnostic evidence space, enabling evidence-aware cross-modal alignment and allowing LGDEA to effectively exploit abundant unpaired medical images and reports, thereby substantially alleviating the reliance on paired data.

When the length is unknown, as in realistic completion and infilling, naively comparing confidence across mask lengths becomes systematically biased, leading to under-generation or redundant continuations. In this paper, we show that this failure arises from an intrinsic lengthinduced bias in generation confidence estimates, leaving existing DLLMs without a robust way to determine generation length and making variablelength inference unreliable. To address this issue, we propose LR-DLLM, a length-regularized inference framework for DLLMs that treats generation length as an explicit variable and achieves reliable length determination at inference time. It decouples semantic compatibility from lengthinduced uncertainty through an explicit length regularization that corrects biased confidence estimates. Based on this, LR-DLLM enables dynamic expansion or contraction of the generation span without modifying the underlying DLLM or its training procedure.

Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack.

However, unlike computer vision tasks where visual fidelity suffices, physical systems require the rigorous reproduction of higher-order statistical moments and thermodynamic quantities. While Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) have emerged as a powerful tool, their standard formulation on Euclidean embedding space is ill-suited for continuous spin systems, where variables inherently reside on a manifold. In this work, we demonstrate that training on the Euclidean space compromises the model's ability to learn the target distribution as it prioritizes to learn the manifold constraints. We address this limitation by proposing the use of Manifold-Aware Score-Based Generative Modeling framework applied to the 64x64 2D XY model (a 4096-dimensional torus). We show that our method estimates the theoretical Boltzmann score with superior precision compared to standard diffusion models. Consequently, we successfully capture the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) phase transition and accurately reproduce second-moment quantities, such as heat capacity without explicit feature engineering. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot generalization to unseen lattice sizes, accurately recovering the physics of variable system scales without retraining. Since this approach bypasses domain-specific feature engineering, it remains intrinsically generalizable to other continuous spin systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6d41\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6570\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u7ef4XY\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u73b0\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b27\u6c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u6570\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d41\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6570\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e64x64\u4e8c\u7ef4XY\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6355\u6349BKT\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u73b0\u70ed\u5bb9\u7b49\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u8fde\u7eed\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Prior works on dialogue summary evaluation largely ignore the complexities specific to this task: (i) shift in structure, from multiple speakers discussing information in a scattered fashion across several turns, to a summary's sentences, and (ii) shift in narration viewpoint, from speakers' first/second-person narration, standardized third-person narration in the summary. In this work, we introduce our framework DIALSUMMER to address the above. We propose DIAL-SUMMER's taxonomy of errors to comprehensively evaluate dialogue summaries at two hierarchical levels: DIALOGUE-LEVEL that focuses on the broader speakers/turns, and WITHIN-TURN-LEVEL that focuses on the information talked about inside a turn. We then present DIAL-SUMMER's dataset composed of dialogue summaries manually annotated with our taxonomy's fine-grained errors. We conduct empirical analyses of these annotated errors, and observe interesting trends (e.g., turns occurring in middle of the dialogue are the most frequently missed in the summary, extrinsic hallucinations largely occur at the end of the summary). We also conduct experiments on LLM-Judges' capability at detecting these errors, through which we demonstrate the challenging nature of our dataset, the robustness of our taxonomy, and the need for future work in this field to enhance LLMs' performance in the same.

These templates can force policies to process irrelevant information that distracts from critical action-prediction signals. This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement. By treating reasoning as a latent variable within importance-weighted variational inference, models can generate and distill a refined reasoning training dataset of embodiment-specific strategies without external rewards, verifiers, or human annotation.

Finally, MA-ADV identifies the minimal-cost perturbation through a combination of sample-wise Adam optimization, iterative refinement, and binary search.

However, exploration of this risk remains largely anecdotal, lacking concrete characterization and automated methods to proactively surface long-tail unintended behaviors under realistic CUA scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce the first conceptual and methodological framework for unintended CUA behaviors, by defining their key characteristics, automatically eliciting them, and analyzing how they arise from benign inputs. We propose AutoElicit: an agentic framework that iteratively perturbs benign instructions using CUA execution feedback, and elicits severe harms while keeping perturbations realistic and benign. Using AutoElicit, we surface hundreds of harmful unintended behaviors from state-of-the-art CUAs such as Claude 4.5 Haiku and Opus. We further evaluate the transferability of human-verified successful perturbations, identifying persistent susceptibility to unintended behaviors across various other frontier CUAs.

Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens.

However, iterative denoising leads to substantial inference latency, limiting control frequency in real-time closed-loop systems. Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively.

In this attack scenario, malicious commands hidden within untrusted content trick the agent into performing unauthorized actions. Existing defenses can reduce attack success but often suffer from the over-defense dilemma: they deploy expensive, always-on sanitization regardless of actual threat, thereby degrading utility and latency even in benign scenarios. We revisit IPI through a causal ablation perspective: a successful injection manifests as a dominance shift where the user request no longer provides decisive support for the agent's privileged action, while a particular untrusted segment, such as a retrieved document or tool output, provides disproportionate attributable influence. Based on this signature, we propose CausalArmor, a selective defense framework that (i) computes lightweight, leave-one-out ablation-based attributions at privileged decision points, and (ii) triggers targeted sanitization only when an untrusted segment dominates the user intent. Additionally, CausalArmor employs retroactive Chain-of-Thought masking to prevent the agent from acting on ``poisoned'' reasoning traces. We present a theoretical analysis showing that sanitization based on attribution margins conditionally yields an exponentially small upper bound on the probability of selecting malicious actions. Experiments on AgentDojo and DoomArena demonstrate that CausalArmor matches the security of aggressive defenses while improving explainability and preserving utility and latency of AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51faAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6613\u53d7\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9632\u5fa1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCausalArmor\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9632\u5fa1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u56e0\u679c\u6d88\u878d\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCausalArmor\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u89e6\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6e05\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a9\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6e05\u7406\u80fd\u4f7f\u9009\u62e9\u6076\u610f\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6709\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u5c0f\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u5728AgentDojo\u548cDoomArena\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCausalArmor\u5339\u914d\u5f3a\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "CausalArmor\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9632\u5fa1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

At the heart of this process is not just the ability to communicate but also the remarkable flexibility in how we can express ourselves. We can express the same thoughts in virtually infinite ways using different words and structures - this ability to rephrase and reformulate expressions is known as paraphrase. Modeling paraphrases is a keystone to meaning in computational language models; being able to construct different variations of texts that convey the same meaning or not shows strong abilities of semantic understanding. If computational language models are to represent meaning, they must understand and control the different aspects that construct the same meaning as opposed to different meanings at a fine granularity. Yet most existing approaches reduce paraphrasing to a binary decision between two texts or to producing a single rewrite of a source, obscuring which linguistic factors are responsible for meaning preservation. In this thesis, I propose that decomposing paraphrases into their constituent linguistic aspects (paraphrase types) offers a more fine-grained and cognitively grounded view of semantic equivalence. I show that even advanced machine learning models struggle with this task. Yet, when explicitly trained on paraphrase types, models achieve stronger performance on related paraphrase tasks and downstream applications. For example, in plagiarism detection, language models trained on paraphrase types surpass human baselines: 89.6% accuracy compared to 78.4% for plagiarism cases from Wikipedia, and 66.5% compared to 55.7% for plagiarism of scientific papers from arXiv. In identifying duplicate questions on Quora, models trained with paraphrase types improve over models trained on binary pairs.

In professional AI-assisted filmmaking, it is crucial to perform precise, targeted modifications. A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics. Experiments demonstrate that PISCO consistently outperforms strong inpainting and video editing baselines under sparse control, and exhibits clear, monotonic performance improvements as additional control signals are provided.

Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition.

We finally introduce UGBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate how spatially grounded embeddings support diverse urban understanding tasks -- including geolocation ranking, image retrieval, urban perception, and spatial grounding. We develop UGE on multiple state-of-the-art VLM backbones, including Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, Phi-3-Vision, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral, and train fixed-dimensional spatial embeddings with LoRA tuning. UGE built upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone achieves up to 44% improvement in image retrieval and 30% in geolocation ranking on training cities, and over 30% and 22% gains respectively on held-out cities, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit spatial grounding for spatially intensive urban tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165UGData\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faUGE\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548cUGBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u591aVLM\u4e3b\u5e72\u4e0a\u5f00\u53d1UGE\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u7406\u89e3\u5177\u7a7a\u95f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u57ce\u5e02\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u660e\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165UGData\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u63d0\u51faUGE\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56fe\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\uff1b\u5f15\u5165UGBench\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u652f\u6301\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVLM\u4e3b\u5e72\u4e0a\u5f00\u53d1UGE\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eQwen2.5 - VL - 7B\u4e3b\u5e72\u7684UGE\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6392\u540d\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534744%\u548c30%\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u57ce\u5e02\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u8d8530%\u548c22%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u951a\u5b9a\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57ce\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a roadmap to quantum aesthetics that examines how quantum concepts become aesthetic phenomena through artistic mediation rather than direct representation. Two complementary and orthogonal approaches are articulated. The first, a pioneering top-down approach, employs text-prompt-based generative AI to probe quantum aesthetics as a collective cultural construct embedded in large-scale training data. By systematically modulating the linguistic weight of the term \"quantum,\" generative models are used as experimental environments to reveal how quantum imaginaries circulate within contemporary visual culture. The second, a bottom-up approach, derives aesthetic form directly from quantum-mechanical structures through the visualization of quantum-generated data, exemplified here by hydrogen atomic orbitals calculated from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. These approaches are framed not as competing methods but as intersecting paths within a navigable field of artistic research. They position quantum aesthetics as an emergent field of artistic research shaped by cultural imagination, computational mediation, and physical law, opening new directions for artistic practice and pedagogy at the intersection of art, data, artificial intelligence and quantum science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u7f8e\u5b66\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6982\u5ff5\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u827a\u672f\u5a92\u4ecb\u6210\u4e3a\u5ba1\u7f8e\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u827a\u672f\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u76f4\u63a5\u611f\u5b98\u4f53\u9a8c\u800c\u8a00\u8f83\u96be\u89e6\u53ca\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u6982\u5ff5\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u827a\u672f\u5a92\u4ecb\u6210\u4e3a\u5ba1\u7f8e\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u63a2\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u7f8e\u5b66\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u5bfc\u51fa\u7f8e\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u60f3\u8c61\u5728\u5f53\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u5f97\u7f8e\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u7f8e\u5b66\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u827a\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u827a\u672f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Unlike standard locomotion or static manipulation, this task demands a seamless integration of explosive whole-body coordination and precise, timing-critical interception. While recent advances have achieved lifelike motion mimicry, bridging the gap between kinematic imitation and functional, physics-aware striking without compromising stylistic naturalness is non-trivial. To address this, we propose Imitation-to-Interaction, a progressive reinforcement learning framework designed to evolve a robot from a \"mimic\" to a capable \"striker.\" Our approach establishes a robust motor prior from human data, distills it into a compact, model-based state representation, and stabilizes dynamics via adversarial priors.

However, existing frameworks remain predominantly confined to single-arm manipulation, failing to capture the spatio-temporal coordination required for bimanual tasks like lifting a heavy pot. To address this, we introduce BiManiBench, a hierarchical benchmark evaluating MLLMs across three tiers: fundamental spatial reasoning, high-level action planning, and low-level end-effector control. Our framework isolates unique bimanual challenges, such as arm reachability and kinematic constraints, thereby distinguishing perceptual hallucinations from planning failures. Analysis of over 30 state-of-the-art models reveals that despite high-level reasoning proficiency, MLLMs struggle with dual-arm spatial grounding and control, frequently resulting in mutual interference and sequencing errors. These findings suggest the current paradigm lacks a deep understanding of mutual kinematic constraints, highlighting the need for future research to focus on inter-arm collision-avoidance and fine-grained temporal sequencing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6BiManiBench\uff0c\u5206\u679030\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0MLLMs\u5728\u53cc\u81c2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u81c2\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u53cc\u81c2\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u8c03\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165BiManiBench\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u53cc\u81c2\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u679030\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cMLLMs\u867d\u6709\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53cc\u81c2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u76f8\u4e92\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8303\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u76f8\u4e92\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u81c2\u95f4\u907f\u78b0\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}}

A central bottleneck is representation: hand-crafted flow statistics are efficient but often too lossy, raw-bit encodings can be accurate but are costly, and recent pre-trained embeddings provide transfer but frequently flatten the protocol stack and entangle signals across layers. We observe that real traffic contains substantial redundancy both across network layers and within each layer; existing paradigms do not explicitly identify and remove this redundancy, leading to wasted capacity, shortcut learning, and degraded generalization. To address this, we propose PACC, a redundancy-aware, layer-aware representation framework. PACC treats the protocol stack as multi-view inputs and learns compact layer-wise projections that remain faithful to each layer while explicitly factorizing representations into shared (cross-layer) and private (layer-specific) components. We operationalize these goals with a joint objective that preserves layer-specific information via reconstruction, captures shared structure via contrastive mutual-information learning, and maximizes task-relevant information via supervised losses, yielding compact latents suitable for efficient inference.

Existing methods typically employ coarse-grained attention as a proxy for block importance estimation, but often resort to expensive token-level searching or scoring, resulting in significant selection overhead. In this work, we trace the inaccuracy of standard coarse-grained attention via mean pooling to a theoretical root cause: the interaction between mean pooling and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a \"blind spot\" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency.

We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency.

However, the decentralized optimization of SR parameters -- transmission power and Carrier Sensing Threshold (CST) -- across different Basic Service Sets (BSSs) is challenging due to the lack of global state information. In addition, the concurrent operation of multiple agents creates a highly non-stationary environment, often resulting in suboptimal global configurations (e.g., using the maximum possible transmission power by default). To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a decentralized learning algorithm based on regret-matching, grounded in internal regret minimization. Unlike standard decentralized ``selfish'' approaches that often converge to inefficient Nash Equilibria (NE), internal regret minimization guides competing agents toward Correlated Equilibria (CE), effectively mimicking coordination without explicit communication. Through simulation results, we showcase the superiority of our proposed approach and its ability to reach near-optimal global performance.

In the context of supervised learning, most of the works that tackle classification problems with parameterized quantum circuits constrain their scope to the setting of binary classification or perform multiclass classification via ensembles of binary classifiers (strategies such as one versus rest). Those few works that propose native multiclass models, however, do not justify the choice of observables that perform the classification. This work studies two main classification criteria in multiclass quantum machine learning: maximizing the expected value of an observable representing a class or maximizing the fidelity of the encoded quantum state with a reference state representing a class. To compare both approaches, sets of Pauli strings and sets of projectors into the computational basis are chosen as observables in the quantum machine learning models. Observing the empirical behavior of each model type, the effect of different observable set choices on the performance of quantum machine learning models is analyzed in the context of Barren Plateaus and Neural Collapse.

In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios.

To address long-term systemic risks, we introduce a scalable approach that simulates in-silico agents using the strategic foresight method of the Futures Wheel. We applied it to four AI uses spanning Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs): Chatbot Companion (TRL 9, mature), AI Toy (TRL 7, medium), Griefbot (TRL 5, low), and Death App (TRL 2, conceptual). Across 30 agent runs per use, agents produced 86-110 consequences, condensed into 27-47 unique risks. To benchmark the agent outputs against human perspectives, we collected evaluations from 290 domain experts and 7 leaders, and conducted Futures Wheel sessions with 42 experts and 42 laypeople. Agents generated many systemic consequences across runs. Compared with these outputs, experts identified fewer risks, typically less systemic but judged more likely, whereas laypeople surfaced more emotionally salient concerns that were generally less systemic.

Our position is that much of the technical literature relies on traditional reconstruction techniques that are not designed for copyright analysis.

Starting from 113,475 scenarios, we generate a balanced pool of 10,000 very-hard multiple-choice questions using task-conditioned prompts that enforce multi-step quantitative reasoning under uncertainty and worst-case regret minimization over multi-turn horizons. After automated filtering and expert human validation, 3,722 questions are retained as a high-confidence evaluation set, while the full pool is released to support training and fine-tuning of 6G-specialized models. Using 6G-Bench, we evaluate 22 foundation models spanning dense and mixture-of-experts architectures, short- and long-context designs (up to 1M tokens), and both open-weight and proprietary systems. Across models, deterministic single-shot accuracy (pass@1) spans a wide range from 0.22 to 0.82, highlighting substantial variation in semantic reasoning capability. Leading models achieve intent and policy reasoning accuracy in the range 0.87--0.89, while selective robustness analysis on reasoning-intensive tasks shows pass@5 values ranging from 0.20 to 0.91.

Yet despite these gains, it remains unclear how language backbone representations adapt during multimodal training and when vision-specific capabilities emerge. In this work, we present the first mechanistic analysis of VLM adaptation. Using stage-wise model diffing, a technique that isolates representational changes introduced during multimodal fine-tuning, we reveal how a language model learns to \"see\". We first identify vision-preferring features that emerge or reorient during fine-tuning. We then show that a selective subset of these features reliably encodes spatial relations, revealed through controlled shifts to spatial prompts. Finally, we trace the causal activation of these features to a small group of attention heads. Our findings show that stage-wise model diffing reveals when and where spatially grounded multimodal features arise. It also provides a clearer view of modality fusion by showing how visual grounding reshapes features that were previously text-only.

Our checker supports all VeriPB kernel rules, including cutting-plane derivations and proof-by-contradiction subproofs. In contrast to external verified checkers that produce verdicts, our integration yields Lean theorems that can serve as composable lemmas in larger formal developments.

This paper challenges that assumption by examining the technosocial risks posed by ideal ERTs, understood as multimodal systems capable of reliably inferring inner affective states in real time. Drawing on philosophical accounts of emotional expression and social practice, as well as empirical work in affective science and social psychology, I argue that the appeal of such systems rests on a misunderstanding of the social functions of emotional expression. Emotional expressions function not only as read-outs of inner states, but also as tools for coordinating action, enabling moral repair, sustaining interpersonal trust, and supporting collective norms. These functions depend on a background of partial opacity and epistemic friction. When deployed in socially authoritative or evaluative contexts, ideal ERTs threaten this expressive space by collapsing epistemic friction, displacing relational meaning with technology-mediated affective profiles, and narrowing the space for aspirational and role-sensitive expressions. The result is a drift towards affective determinism and ambient forms of affective auditing, which undermine both social cohesion and individual agency. I argue that, although it is intuitive to think that increasing accuracy would legitimise such systems, in the case of ERTs accuracy does not straightforwardly justify their deployment, and may, in some contexts, provide a reason for regulatory restraint. I conclude by defending a function-first regulatory approach that treats expressive discretion and intentional emotional expression as constitutive of certain social goods, and that accordingly seeks to protect these goods from excessive affective legibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\uff08ERTs\uff09\u56e0\u63d0\u9ad8\u60c5\u611f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4f7f\u793e\u4f1a\u53d7\u76ca\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6280\u672f\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u4f18\u5148\u76d1\u7ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591\u7406\u60f3ERTs\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u793e\u4f1a\u751f\u6d3b\u5c06\u53d7\u76ca\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u54f2\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u60f3ERTs\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u6743\u5a01\u6216\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u4f1a\u5a01\u80c1\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u60c5\u611f\u51b3\u5b9a\u8bba\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u793e\u4f1a\u51dd\u805a\u529b\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ERTs\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u62a4\u793e\u4f1a\u5229\u76ca\u514d\u53d7\u8fc7\u5ea6\u60c5\u611f\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

From a design perspective, better predictions compete with other investments, such as expanding capacity or improving treatment quality.

However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model.

Here, we introduce an on-the-fly outlier detection scheme that automatically down-weights noisy samples, without requiring additional reference calculations. By tracking the loss distribution via an exponential moving average, this unsupervised method identifies outliers throughout a single training run. We show that this approach prevents overfitting and matches the performance of iterative refinement baselines with significantly reduced overhead. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated by recovering accurate physical observables for liquid water from unconverged reference data, including diffusion coefficients.

Numerous methods have been developed to perform this task, however, they often fail in the presence of neuropathology and can be inconsistent in defining the boundary of the brain mask. Here, we propose a novel approach to skull strip T1-weighted images in a robust and efficient manner, aiming to consistently segment the outer surface of the brain, including the sulcal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), while excluding the full extent of the subarachnoid space and meninges. We train a modified version of the U-net on silver-standard ground truth data using a novel loss function based on the signed-distance transform (SDT). We validate our model both qualitatively and quantitatively using held-out data from the training dataset, as well as an independent external dataset. The brain masks used for evaluation partially or fully include the subarachnoid space, which may introduce bias into the comparison; nonetheless, our model demonstrates strong performance on the held-out test data, achieving a consistent mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.964$\\pm$0.006 and an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 1.4mm$\\pm$0.2mm. Performance on the external dataset is comparable, with a DSC of 0.958$\\pm$0.006 and an ASSD of 1.7$\\pm$0.2mm. Our method achieves performance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art methods for brain extraction, particularly in its highly consistent preservation of the brain's outer surface.

However, prior work is primarily evaluated on natural-language benchmarks using task-level metrics, where token-level difficulty is unobservable and confounded with architectural factors, making it unclear whether compute allocation truly aligns with underlying complexity. We address this gap through three contributions. First, we introduce a complexity-controlled evaluation paradigm using algorithmic and synthetic language tasks with parameterized difficulty, enabling direct testing of token-level compute allocation. Second, we propose ANIRA, a unified recurrent Transformer framework that supports per-token variable-depth computation while isolating compute allocation decisions from other model factors. Third, we use this framework to conduct a systematic analysis of token-level adaptive computation across alignment with complexity, generalization, and decision timing. Our results show that compute allocation aligned with task complexity can emerge without explicit difficulty supervision, but such alignment does not imply algorithmic generalization: models fail to extrapolate to unseen input sizes despite allocating additional computation. We further find that early compute decisions rely on static structural cues, whereas online halting more closely tracks algorithmic execution state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9token\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u673a\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524dtoken\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0ctoken\u7ea7\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u652f\u6301\u6bcftoken\u53ef\u53d8\u6df1\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684ANIRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u96be\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u80fd\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u7b97\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u505c\u6b62\u66f4\u80fd\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u6267\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "token\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u673a\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u589e\u52a0\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8f93\u5165\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3002"}}

Submitted to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI)", "summary": "Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is limited by expensive annotations and data heterogeneity across scanners and sites. We propose a semi-supervised teacher-student framework that combines an uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling teacher with a progressive, confidence-based curriculum for the student. The teacher produces probabilistic masks and per-pixel uncertainty; unlabeled scans are ranked by image-level confidence and introduced in stages, while a dual-loss objective trains the student to learn from high-confidence regions and unlearn low-confidence ones. Agreement-based refinement further improves pseudo-label quality. On BraTS 2021, validation DSC increased from 0.393 (10% data) to 0.872 (100%), with the largest gains in early stages, demonstrating data efficiency. The teacher reached a validation DSC of 0.922, and the student surpassed the teacher on tumor subregions (e.g., NCR/NET 0.797 and Edema 0.980); notably, the student recovered the Enhancing class (DSC 0.620) where the teacher failed.

Timely detection is critical as symptoms can escalate rapidly. Early recognition enables simple interventions such as descent, oxygen, or medication, and prompt treatment can save lives by significantly lowering the risk of severe complications. Although conventional machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to identify altitude sickness using physiological signals, such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, they often struggle to balance predictive performance with low hardware demands. In contrast, hyperdimensional computing (HDC) remains under-explored for this task with limited biomedical features, where it may offer a compelling alternative to existing classification models. Its vector symbolic framework is inherently suited to hardware-efficient design, making it a strong candidate for low-power systems like wearables. Leveraging lightweight computation and efficient streamlined memory usage, HDC enables real-time detection of altitude sickness from physiological parameters collected by wearable devices, achieving accuracy comparable to that of traditional ML models. We present AMS-HD, a novel system that integrates tailored feature extraction and Hadamard HV encoding to enhance both the precision and efficiency of HDC-based detection. This framework is well-positioned for deployment in wearable health monitoring platforms, enabling continuous, on-the-go tracking of acute altitude sickness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u9ad8\u539f\u75c5\u53ca\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8d85\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08HDC\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u7cfb\u7edfAMS - HD\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u539f\u75c5\u75c7\u72b6\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u53ca\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22HDC\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u539f\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMS - HD\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5b9a\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548cHadamard HV\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "HDC\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u751f\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u9ad8\u539f\u75c5\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfML\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "AMS - HD\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6025\u6027\u9ad8\u539f\u75c5\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002"}}

However, complex multi-turn support remains challenging.This is because existing alignment schemes rely on sparse outcome-level signals, thus offering limited supervision for intermediate strategy decisions. To fill this gap, this paper proposes affective flow language model for emotional support conversation (AFlow), a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision on dialogue prefixes by modeling a continuous affective flow along multi-turn trajectories. AFlow can estimate intermediate utility over searched trajectories and learn preference-consistent strategy transitions. To improve strategy coherence and empathetic response quality, a subpath-level flow-balance objective is presented to propagate preference signals to intermediate states. Experiment results show consistent and significant improvements over competitive baselines in diverse emotional contexts. Remarkably, AFlow with a compact open-source backbone outperforms proprietary LMMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on major ESC metrics.

The core of our method is a novel joint representation of dense 3D point maps and 3D scene flows in a shared coordinate system, and a novel 4D VAE to effectively learn this representation. Unlike prior work that forces the 3D value and latents to align strictly with RGB VAE latents-despite their fundamentally different distributions-we show that such alignment is unnecessary and leads to suboptimal performance. Instead, we introduce a new data normalization and VAE training strategy that better transfers diffusion priors and greatly improves reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that MotionCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in both geometry reconstruction and dense scene flow estimation, delivering 38.64% and 25.0% improvements in geometry and motion reconstruction, respectively, all without any post-optimization.

Prior work has explored correlating local policies via shared randomness, sometimes in the form of a correlation device, as a mechanism to assist in decentralized decision-making. In contrast, this work introduces the first framework for training MARL agents to exploit shared quantum entanglement as a coordination resource, which permits a larger class of communication-free correlated policies than shared randomness alone. This is motivated by well-known results in quantum physics which posit that, for certain single-round cooperative games with no communication, shared quantum entanglement enables strategies that outperform those that only use shared randomness. In such cases, we say that there is quantum advantage. Our framework is based on a novel differentiable policy parameterization that enables optimization over quantum measurements, together with a novel policy architecture that decomposes joint policies into a quantum coordinator and decentralized local actors. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we first show that we can learn, purely from experience, strategies that attain quantum advantage in single-round games that are treated as black box oracles. We then demonstrate how our machinery can learn policies with quantum advantage in an illustrative multi-agent sequential decision-making problem formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u4f5c\u4e3a\u534f\u8c03\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e8f\u8d2f\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MARL\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u8868\u660e\u5171\u4eab\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u65e0\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5355\u8f6e\u5408\u4f5c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f15\u5165\u5229\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7b56\u7565\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u8054\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u548c\u5206\u6563\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e8f\u8d2f\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5229\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728MARL\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, current ways of entire-block pruning suffer from risks of discarding meaningful cues learned in those blocks, leading to substantial performance degradation. As another line of model compression, channel pruning can better preserve performance, while it cannot reduce model depth and is challenged by inconsistent pruning ratios for individual layers. To pursue better model compression and acceleration, this paper proposes \\textbf{FlattenGPT}, a novel way to detect and reduce depth-wise redundancies. By flatting two adjacent blocks into one, it compresses the network depth, meanwhile enables more effective parameter redundancy detection and removal. FlattenGPT allows to preserve the knowledge learned in all blocks, and remains consistent with the original transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlattenGPT enhances model efficiency with a decent trade-off to performance. It outperforms existing pruning methods in both zero-shot accuracies and WikiText-2 perplexity across various model types and parameter sizes. On LLaMA-2/3 and Qwen-1.5 models, FlattenGPT retains 90-96\\% of zero-shot performance with a compression ratio of 20\\%.

A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%.

Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context.

We investigate how communication strategies evolve through repeated collaboration as people coordinate on shared procedural abstractions. To this end, we conducted an online unimodal study (n = 98) using natural language to probe abstraction hierarchies. In a follow-up lab study (n = 40), we examined how multimodal communication (speech and gestures) changed during physical collaboration. Pairs used augmented reality to isolate their partner's hand and voice; one participant viewed a 3D virtual tower and sent instructions to the other, who built the physical tower.

Addressing this challenge calls for analyzing interactions between agents and incorporating common-sense reasoning into planning. This paper presents a social robot navigation framework that integrates geometric planning with contextual social reasoning. The system first extracts obstacles and human dynamics to generate geometrically feasible candidate paths, then leverages a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) to evaluate these paths, informed by contextually grounded social expectations, selecting a socially optimized path for the controller. This task-specific VLM distills social reasoning from large foundation models into a smaller and efficient model, allowing the framework to perform real-time adaptation in diverse human-robot interaction contexts. Experiments in four social navigation contexts demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance with the lowest personal space violation duration, the minimal pedestrian-facing time, and no social zone intrusions.

However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation.

In many cases, attackers use deceptive emails along with malicious attachments to trick users into giving away sensitive information or installing malware while compromising entire systems. The flexibility of malicious email attachments makes them stand out as a preferred vector for attackers as they can embed harmful content such as malware or malicious URLs inside standard document formats. Although phishing email defenses have improved a lot, attackers continue to abuse attachments, enabling malicious content to bypass security measures. Moreover, another challenge that researches face in training advance models, is lack of an unified and comprehensive dataset that covers the most prevalent data types. To address this gap, we generated CIC-Trap4Phish, a multi-format dataset containing both malicious and benign samples across five categories commonly used in phishing campaigns: Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PDF files, HTML pages, and QR code images. For the first four file types, a set of execution-free static feature pipeline was proposed, designed to capture structural, lexical, and metadata-based indicators without the need to open or execute files. Feature selection was performed using a combination of SHAP analysis and feature importance, yielding compact, discriminative feature subsets for each file type. The selected features were evaluated by using lightweight machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree. All models demonstrate high detection accuracy across formats. For QR code-based phishing (quishing), two complementary methods were implemented: image-based detection by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and lexical analysis of decoded URLs using recent lightweight language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u9493\u9c7c\u90ae\u4ef6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u683c\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6CIC - Trap4Phish\uff0c\u4e3a\u56db\u79cd\u6587\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u7ba1\u9053\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7801\u9493\u9c7c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u9493\u9c7c\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5e38\u7528\u6076\u610f\u90ae\u4ef6\u9644\u4ef6\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u5c11\u7edf\u4e00\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u751f\u6210\u591a\u683c\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6CIC - Trap4Phish\uff1b\u4e3a\u524d\u56db\u79cd\u6587\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u6267\u884c\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528SHAP\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7801\u9493\u9c7c\u91c7\u7528CNN\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884cURL\u8bcd\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u9493\u9c7c\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}
