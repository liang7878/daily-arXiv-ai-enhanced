In this paper we introduce and study a simple combinatorial model to capture higher order dependencies from an algorithms and computational complexity perspective. Specifically, we introduce the String Set Reconstruction problem, which asks when a set of strings can be reconstructed from seeing only the k-way projections of strings in the set. This problem is distinguished from genetic reconstruction problems in that we allow projections from any k indices and we maintain knowledge of those indices, but not which k-mer came from which string. We give several results on the complexity of this problem, including hardness results, inapproximability, and parametrized complexity.\n  Our main result is the introduction of a new algorithm for this problem using a modified version of overlap graphs from genetic reconstruction algorithms. A key difference we must overcome is that in our setting the k-mers need not be contiguous, unlike the setting of genetic reconstruction. We exhibit our algorithm's efficiency in a variety of experiments, and give high-level explanations for how its complexity is observed to scale with various parameters. We back up these explanation with analytic approximations. We also consider the related problems of: whether a single string can be reconstructed from the k-way projections of a given set of strings, and finding the largest k at which we get no information about the original data set from its k-way projections (i.e., the largest $k$ for which it is \"k-wise independent\").", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u89d2\u5ea6\u5f15\u5165\u7ec4\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u96c6\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5f88\u591a\u73b0\u8c61\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d85\u51fa\u56fe\u6240\u6355\u6349\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6210\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u96c6\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u56e0\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u91cd\u53e0\u56fe\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u7248\u672c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968f\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u96c6\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Per-record Differential Privacy (PrDP) addresses this by defining the privacy budget as a function of each record, offering better alignment with real-world needs. However, the dependency between the privacy budget and the data value introduces challenges in protecting the budget's privacy itself. Existing solutions either handle specific privacy functions or adopt relaxed PrDP definitions. A simple workaround is to use the global minimum of the privacy function, but this severely degrades utility, as the minimum is often set extremely low to account for rare records with high privacy needs. In this work, we propose a general and practical framework that enables any standard DP mechanism to support PrDP, with error depending only on the minimal privacy requirement among records actually present in the dataset. Since directly revealing this minimum may leak information, we introduce a core technique called privacy-specified domain partitioning, which ensures accurate estimation without compromising privacy.

However, deploying these models for EHR question answering (QA) systems in safety-critical clinical environments remains challenging: incorrect SQL queries-whether caused by model errors or problematic user inputs-can undermine clinical decision-making and jeopardize patient care. While prior work has mainly focused on improving SQL generation accuracy or filtering questions before execution, there is a lack of a unified benchmark for evaluating independent post-hoc verification mechanisms (i.e., a component that inspects and validates the generated SQL before execution), which is crucial for safe deployment. To fill this gap, we introduce SCARE, a benchmark for evaluating methods that function as a post-hoc safety layer in EHR QA systems. SCARE evaluates the joint task of (1) classifying question answerability (i.e., determining whether a question is answerable, ambiguous, or unanswerable) and (2) verifying or correcting candidate SQL queries. The benchmark comprises 4,200 triples of questions, candidate SQL queries, and expected model outputs, grounded in the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU databases. It covers a diverse set of questions and corresponding candidate SQL queries generated by seven different text-to-SQL models, ensuring a realistic and challenging evaluation.

However, a significant gap remains: current re-rankers often lack mechanisms for fine-grained user control. They struggle to balance inherent user preferences with multiple attribute-based constraints, often resorting to simplistic hard filtering that can excessively narrow the recommendation pool and yield suboptimal results. This limitation leaves users as passive recipients rather than active collaborators in the recommendation process. To bridge this gap, we propose COREC, a novel token-augmented re-ranking framework that incorporates specific user requirements in co-creating the recommendation outcome. COREC empowers users to steer re-ranking results with precise and flexible control via explicit, attribute-based signals. The framework learns to balance these commands against latent preferences, yielding rankings that adhere to user instructions without sacrificing personalization.

However, identifying optimal trades is complex due to varying player projections, positional needs, and league-specific scoring. Existing approaches focus on team selection or lineup optimization, but automated trade generation remains underexplored. In this paper, an algorithm that generates optimal trades, biasing toward improved playoff performance while maintaining apparent fairness for negotiation is explored. We introduce a genetic algorithm for fantasy football trade optimization, building on existing frameworks for team selection and lineup generation. The algorithm initializes with single-player trades, evolves through custom mutations (add/remove players, combine trades, exchange players, add from other trades, and spawn new trades), and uses team-specific elitism to preserve diversity. The cost function incorporates a playoff-weighted gain for the user's team (while maintaining apparent fairness), opponent gain, and fairness penalty. Integration with ESPN data sources enables real-time projections for all positions, including kickers and defenses.

Quality in Requirements Engineering (RE) is still predominantly anecdotal and intuition-driven. Creating a solid requirements quality model requires broad sets of empirical evidence to evaluate quality factors and their context. Problem. However, empirical data on the detailed effects of requirements quality defects is scarce, since it is costly to obtain. Furthermore, with the advent of AI-based development, the requirements quality factors may change: Requirements are no longer only consumed by humans, but increasingly also by AI agents, which might lead to a different efficient and effective requirements style. Principal ideas. We propose to extend the RE research toolbox with Agentic AI simulations, in which software engineering (SE) processes are replicated by standardized agents in stochastic, dynamic, event-driven, qualitative simulations. We argue that their speed and simplicity makes them a valuable addition to RE research, although limitations in replicating human behavior need to be studied and understood. Contribution.

Managers must adjust their strategies based on the changing state of the game in order to give their team the best chance of winning. In this thesis, we investigate how matchup models -- tools that predict the probabilities of plate appearance outcomes -- impact in-game strategy and ultimately affect win probability. We develop four progressively complex, hierarchical Bayesian models that predict plate appearance outcomes by combining information from both pitchers and batters, their handedness, and recent data, along with base running probabilities calibrated to a player's base-stealing tendencies.\n  Using each model within a game-theoretic framework, we approximate subgame perfect Nash equilibria for in-game decisions, including substitutions and intentional walks. Simulations of the 2024 MLB postseason show that more accurate matchup models can yield tangible gains in win probability -- as much as one additional victory per 162-game season. Furthermore, employing the most detailed model to generate win predictions for actual playoff games demonstrates alignment with market expectations, underscoring both the power and potential of advanced matchup modeling for on-field strategy and prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8d5b\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u68d2\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u83b7\u80dc\u6982\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u83b7\u80dc\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u9884\u671f\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6bd4\u8d5b\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u68d2\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u6700\u7ec8\u83b7\u80dc\u6982\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u56db\u79cd\u6e10\u8fdb\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u51fb\u7403\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6c42\u5b50\u535a\u5f08\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c2024\u5e74MLB\u5b63\u540e\u8d5b\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u83b7\u80dc\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5728162\u573a\u8d5b\u5b63\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u8d62\u4e00\u573a\uff1b\u7528\u6700\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u5b63\u540e\u8d5b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u9884\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u68d2\u7403\u573a\u4e0a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5236\u5b9a\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Building on a previously formalized metric, the Artificial Age Score (AAS), the study maps twenty core propositions from the Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture. In this design, each monad functions as a modular unit defined by a truth score, a redundancy parameter, and a weighted contribution to a global memory penalty function. Smooth logarithmic transformations operationalize these quantities and yield interpretable, bounded metrics for memory aging, representational stability, and salience. Classical metaphysical notions of perception, apperception, and appetition are reformulated as entropy, gradient dynamics, and internal representation fidelity. Logical principles, including the laws of non-contradiction and sufficient reason, are encoded as regularization constraints guiding memory evolution. A central contribution is a set of first principles proofs establishing refinement invariance, structural decomposability, and monotonicity under scale transformation, aligned with the metaphysical structure of monads. The framework's formal organization is structured into six thematic bundles derived from Monadology, aligning each mathematical proof with its corresponding philosophical domain.

Our model operates in a highly volatile market with a well-diversified portfolio, ensuring a low-risk level for the investor, and leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust portfolio positions over time. Results show that we improved the Sharpe Ratio from 0.42, as suggested by recent studies using the same approach, to a value of 0.483 a notable achievement in highly volatile markets with diversified portfolios. The comparison between G-Learning and GIRL reveals that while GIRL optimizes the reward function parameters (e.g., lambda = 0.0012 compared to 0.002), its impact on portfolio performance remains marginal. This suggests that reinforcement learning methods, like G-Learning, already enable robust optimization. This research contributes to the growing development of reinforcement learning applications in financial decision-making, demonstrating that probabilistic learning algorithms can effectively align portfolio management strategies with investor needs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7528G - Learning\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u521b\u65b0\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GIRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u6ce2\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u63d0\u5347\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u65e5\u671f\u524d\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5b9a\u671f\u6295\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u6ce2\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528G - Learning\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GIRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5934\u5bf8\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\u4ece0.42\u63d0\u5347\u52300.483\uff0cGIRL\u5bf9\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u7ee9\u6548\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f7f\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7b26\u5408\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

There are many ways to quantify discourse, one common way being to evaluate the informativeness of the discourse. That is, given the total number of words produced, how many of those are context-relevant and accurate. This type of analysis is called Correct Information Unit (CIU) analysis and is one of the most prevalent discourse analyses used by speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Despite this, CIU analysis in the clinic remains limited due to the manual labor needed by SLPs to code and analyze collected speech. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) seek to augment such labor by automating modeling of propositional, macrostructural, pragmatic, and multimodal dimensions of discourse. To that end, this study evaluated five ML models for reliable identification of Correct Information Units (CIUs, Nicholas & Brookshire, 1993), during a picture description task. The five supervised ML models were trained using randomly selected human-coded transcripts and accompanying words and CIUs from persons with aphasia. The baseline model training produced a high accuracy across transcripts for word vs non-word, with all models achieving near perfect performance (0.995) with high AUC range (0.914 min, 0.995 max). In contrast, CIU vs non-CIU showed a greater variability, with the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) model the highest accuracy (0.824) and second highest AUC (0.787). These findings indicate that while the supervised ML models can distinguish word from not word, identifying CIUs is challenging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u8bdd\u8bed\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u4fe1\u606f\u5355\u5143\uff08CIU\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u533a\u5206\u5b57\u8bcd\u8f83\u6613\uff0c\u8bc6\u522bCIU\u8f83\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2dCIU\u5206\u6790\u56e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5206\u6790\u800c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u5c55\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6545\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8bc6\u522bCIU\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u7801\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\u53ca\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5b57\u8bcd\u548cCIU\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e94\u79cd\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b57\u8bcd\u4e0e\u975e\u5b57\u8bcd\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff1bCIU\u4e0e\u975eCIU\u8bc6\u522b\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5927\uff0ck - \u8fd1\u90bb\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u533a\u5206\u5b57\u8bcd\u5bb9\u6613\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc6\u522bCIU\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of TSFMs in global financial markets. Using a large-scale dataset of daily excess returns across diverse markets, we evaluate zero-shot inference, fine-tuning, and pre-training from scratch against strong benchmark models. We find that off-the-shelf pre-trained TSFMs perform poorly in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, whereas models pre-trained from scratch on financial data achieve substantial forecasting and economic improvements, underscoring the value of domain-specific adaptation.

Each signal is windowed, amplitude-encoded, transformed by a QFT, then passed through a protective rotation layer to avoid the QFT/QFT adjoint cancellation; the resulting kernel is used in kernel ridge regression (KRR). Exogenous predictors are incorporated by convexly fusing feature-specific kernels. On multi-station solar irradiance data across Koppen climate classes, the proposed kernel consistently improves median R2 and nRMSE over reference classical RBF and polynomials kernels, while also reducing bias (nMBE); complementary MAE/ERMAX analyses indicate tighter average errors with remaining headroom under sharp transients.

However, spatial data are often unstructured, high-dimensional, and difficult to integrate into predictive models. Embedding methods are needed to convert spatial data into meaningful representations for modelling tasks. We propose a novel multi-view contrastive learning framework for generating spatial embeddings that combine information from multiple spatial data sources. To train the model, we construct a spatial dataset that merges satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap features across Europe. The framework aligns these spatial views with coordinate-based encodings, producing low-dimensional embeddings that capture both spatial structure and contextual similarity. Once trained, the model generates embeddings directly from latitude-longitude pairs, enabling any dataset with coordinates to be enriched with meaningful spatial features without requiring access to the original spatial inputs. In a case study on French real estate prices, we compare models trained on raw coordinates against those using our spatial embeddings as inputs. The embeddings consistently improve predictive accuracy across generalised linear, additive, and boosting models, while providing interpretable spatial effects and demonstrating transferability to unseen regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u9669\u627f\u4fdd\uff0c\u5728\u6cd5\u56fd\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u4ef7\u683c\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u96be\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6362\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u9669\u627f\u4fdd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u878d\u5408\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u548cOpenStreetMap\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6b27\u6d32\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u7ecf\u7eac\u5ea6\u5bf9\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u6cd5\u56fd\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u4ef7\u683c\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7a7a\u95f4\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u533a\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u8ba9\u542b\u5750\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e30\u5bcc\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Such studies are critical for long term wealth plannings, for example in the financial component of social insurances or in accumulated capital for retirement. The quality of the results depends on two inputs: the process used for the simulations and its parameters. The base model is a constant drift, a constant covariance and normal innovations, as pioneered by Bachelier. Beyond this model, this document presents in details a multivariate process that incorporate the most recent advances in the models for financial time series. This includes the negative correlations of the returns at a scale of a few years, the heteroskedasticity (i.e. the volatility' dynamics), and the fat tails and asymmetry for the distributions of returns. For the parameters, the quantitative outcomes depend critically on the estimate for the drift, because this is a non random contribution acting at each time step.

These properties are a natural fit for SQL database workloads dominated by predicate evaluation and scans, which demand low energy and low latency over large fact tables. Notably, HDC's noise-tolerance maps well onto emerging ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) memories, which provide ultra-high density and in-storage compute capability but suffer from elevated raw bit-error rates. In this work, we propose HDDB, a hardware-software co-design that combines HDC with FeNAND multi-level cells (MLC) to perform in-storage SQL predicate evaluation and analytics with massive parallelism and minimal data movement. Particularly, we introduce novel HDC encoding techniques for standard SQL data tables and formulate predicate-based filtering and aggregation as highly efficient HDC operations that can happen in-storage. By exploiting the intrinsic redundancy of HDC, HDDB maintains correct predicate and decode outcomes under substantial device noise (up to 10% randomly corrupted TLC cells) without explicit error-correction overheads. Experiments on TPC-DS fact tables show that HDDB achieves up to 80.6x lower latency and 12,636x lower energy consumption compared to conventional CPU/GPU SQL database engines, suggesting that HDDB provides a practical substrate for noise-robust, memory-centric database processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHDDB\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408HDC\u4e0eFeNAND MLC\u8fdb\u884c\u5b58\u50a8\u5185SQL\u8c13\u8bcd\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6709\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "HDC\u7279\u6027\u9002\u5408SQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u5bb9\u9519\u6027\u4e0eFeNAND\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8868\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u6c42\u53caFeNAND\u9ad8\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u786c\u4ef6 - \u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1HDDB\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0HDC\u7f16\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u8c13\u8bcd\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u805a\u5408\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548HDC\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728TPC - DS\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8868\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHDDB\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfCPU/GPU SQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe80.6\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe12,636\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "HDDB\u4e3a\u6297\u566a\u3001\u4ee5\u5185\u5b58\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A key indicator of retention is revisitation, i.e., when users return to view previously saved content, a behavior often sparked by personalized recommendations and user satisfaction. However, modeling and optimizing revisitation poses significant challenges. One core difficulty is accurate attribution: it is often unclear which specific user actions or content exposures trigger a revisit, since many confounding factors (e.g., content quality, user interface, notifications, or even changing user intent) can influence return behavior. Additionally, the scale and timing of revisitations introduce further complexity; users may revisit content days or even weeks after their initial interaction, requiring the system to maintain and associate extensive historical records across millions of users and sessions. These complexities render existing methods insufficient for robustly capturing and optimizing long-term revisitation. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel, lightweight, and interpretable framework for modeling revisitation behavior and optimizing long-term user retention in Pinterest's search-based recommendation context. By defining a surrogate attribution process that links saves to subsequent revisitations, we reduce noise in the causal relationship between user actions and return visits. Our scalable event aggregation pipeline enables large-scale analysis of user revisitation patterns and enhances the ranking system's ability to surface items with high retention value. Deployed on Pinterest's Related Pins surface to serve 500+ million users, the framework led to a significant lift of 0.1% in active users without additional computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3Pinterest\u7528\u6237\u56de\u8bbf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u63d0\u5347\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7528\u6237\u6570\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "Pinterest\u7b49\u5728\u7ebf\u5e73\u53f0\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u7559\u5b58\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u56de\u8bbf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ee3\u7406\u5f52\u56e0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u51cf\u5c11\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e8b\u4ef6\u805a\u5408\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u90e8\u7f72\u5728Pinterest\u7684Related Pins\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u8d855\u4ebf\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7528\u6237\u6570\u63d0\u53470.1%\uff0c\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u56de\u8bbf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u7559\u5b58\u3002"}}

Also, it is essential to support system evolution, service interoperability, and governance across organizational boundaries to ensure good quality and consistency of these APIs. However, evaluating API design quality, which is part of non-functional requirement tasks, remains a largely manual and ad hoc process, particularly during early development. Using a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, we elicited user needs, identified 75 API design rules using a literature review, and implemented a configurable rule engine to detect structural violations in OpenAPI specifications. The proposed tool supports organizational adaptability by allowing rules to be customized, enabled, or disabled, enabling integration of domain-specific standards. The evaluation was conducted through structured experiments and thematic analysis involving industry experts. API quality validation contributes to aligning technical designs with requirements and enterprise architecture by strengthening interoperability and governance between enterprise systems. The results show that S.E.O.R.A facilitates early validation of non-functional API requirements, provides actionable and traceable feedback, and aligns well with requirements elicitation and quality assurance processes. It improves the API design process by automating checks that would otherwise require manual inspection, thus supporting consistent and reusable conformance practices. This work contributes to requirements engineering by operationalizing design principles as verifiable constraints and embedding them into a practical validation tool.

Such comparison allows us to assess how well bids predict future extracted value from the time advantage. The correlation between winning bids and markouts is weak across bidders, suggesting that bids are a noisy predictor of extracted value. The correlation slightly improves when comparing paid bids (the second highest bid) instead of winning bids to markouts, which we attribute to the fact that the auction is more of a common value type. In all settings, the relative order of the most frequent bidder performance remains the same, together with their absolute profits. Bids and markouts aggregated over long time intervals exhibit much higher correlation, indicating that bidders detect trends much better than identify when the high arbitrage value is exactly available. One possible explanation for this is the fact that the correlation between previous minute markouts and current minute bids is significant, suggesting that the previous minute markouts is used to predict the next minute value when bidding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76TimeBoost\u62cd\u5356\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5feb\u901f\u901a\u9053\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u7d2f\u8ba1\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u5feb\u901f\u901a\u9053\u6295\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6295\u6807\u4e0e\u63d0\u53d6\u4ef7\u503c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f31\u7b49\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6295\u6807\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u4f18\u52bf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5feb\u901f\u901a\u9053\u4ea4\u6613\u5728TimeBoost\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u7d2f\u8ba1\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u5feb\u901f\u901a\u9053\u6295\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u6295\u6807\u8005\u95f4\u4e2d\u6807\u6295\u6807\u4e0e\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f31\uff1b\u7528\u652f\u4ed8\u6295\u6807\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\uff1b\u957f\u671f\u805a\u5408\u7684\u6295\u6807\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u524d\u4e00\u5206\u949f\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u5206\u949f\u6295\u6807\u6709\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6295\u6807\u662f\u63d0\u53d6\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5608\u6742\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u62cd\u5356\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5171\u540c\u4ef7\u503c\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u6295\u6807\u8005\u66f4\u64c5\u957f\u68c0\u6d4b\u8d8b\u52bf\u800c\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u9ad8\u5957\u5229\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u6295\u6807\u65f6\u4f1a\u7528\u524d\u4e00\u5206\u949f\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u5206\u949f\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u68c0\u6d4bpix2pix\u5b66\u4e60\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u77ed\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u56fe\u5f62\u7684GAN\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5957\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u7b80\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e14\u8981\u8bc1\u660eI2I GAN\u6709\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bc6\u522b\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728GAN\u524d\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eGrasshopper\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660epix2pix\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4ece\u62d3\u6251\u89d2\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684GAN\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u77ed\u4e14\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u5236\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6279\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528GAN\u4fdd\u7559\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u66f4\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

This paper aims to determine the multiplier of the PPI strategy to maximise the expected utility of the terminal cushion, where the terminal cushion is penalised proportionally to the realised volatility of stocks issued by firms operating in carbon-intensive sectors. We model the risky assets' dynamics using geometric Brownian motions whose drift rates are modulated by an unobservable common stochastic factor to capture market-specific or economy-wide state variables that are typically not directly observable. Using classical stochastic filtering theory, we formulate a suitable optimization problem and solve it for CRRA utility function.

The original fourteen object classes were reorganized into five generalized categories (S-Like, Fast, Long, Periodic, and Non-Periodic) to address class imbalance. After preprocessing with padding, temporal rescaling, and flux normalization, a bidirectional LSTM network with masking layers was trained and evaluated on a test set of 19,920 objects. The model achieved strong performance for S-Like and Periodic classes, with ROC area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.95 and 0.99, and Precision-Recall AUC values of 0.98 and 0.89, respectively. However, performance was significantly lower for Fast and Long classes (ROC AUC of 0.68 for Long class), and the model exhibited difficulty distinguishing between Periodic and Non-Periodic objects. Evaluation on partial light curve data (5, 10,and 20 days from detection) revealed substantial performance degradation, with increased misclassification toward the S-Like class.

Deep generative forecasting models (DGFMs) have shown excellent performance in these areas, but assimilating data into such models is challenging due to their intractable likelihood functions. This limitation restricts the use of standard Bayesian data assimilation methodologies for DGFMs. To overcome this, we introduce prequential posteriors, based upon a predictive-sequential (prequential) loss function; an approach naturally suited for temporally dependent data which is the focus of forecasting tasks. Since the true data-generating process often lies outside the assumed model class, we adopt an alternative notion of consistency and prove that, under mild conditions, both the prequential loss minimizer and the prequential posterior concentrate around parameters with optimal predictive performance. For scalable inference, we employ easily parallelizable wastefree sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers with preconditioned gradient-based kernels, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces such as those in DGFMs. We validate our method on both a synthetic multi-dimensional time series and a real-world meteorological dataset; highlighting its practical utility for data assimilation for complex dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u8d2f\u9884\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u540e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08DGFMs\uff09\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u627e\u5230\u9002\u5408 DGFMs \u7684\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u8d2f\u9884\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u540e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u65e0\u6d6a\u8d39\u5e8f\u8d2f\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\uff08SMC\uff09\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6838\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u591a\u7ef4\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We construct a context specific cost function using empirical experiments and expert feedback. We study two RL policies: an ICU threshold rule computed via Monte Carlo grid search, and a policy based on a posterior averaged Q learning agent. We validate the framework by fitting the epidemic model to publicly available ICU occupancy data from the COVID 19 pandemic in England and then generating counterfactual roll out scenarios under each RL controller, which allows us to compare the RL policies to the historical government strategy.

In $\\texttt{OSDM}$, an operator makes two decisions at each time step: an amount of energy to be purchased, and an amount of energy to be delivered (i.e., used for computation). The difference between these decisions charges (or discharges) the operator's energy storage (e.g., a battery). Two types of demand arrive online: base demand, which must be covered at the current time, and flexible demand, which can be satisfied at any time steps before a demand-specific deadline $\u0394_t$. The operator's goal is to minimize a cost (subject to the constraints above) that combines a cost of purchasing energy, a cost for delivering energy (if applicable), and smoothness penalties on the purchasing and delivery rates to discourage fluctuations and encourage ``grid healthy'' decisions. $\\texttt{OSDM}$ generalizes several problems in the online algorithms literature while being the first to fully model applications of interest. We propose a competitive algorithm called $\\texttt{PAAD}$ (partitioned accounting \\& aggregated decisions) and show it achieves the optimal competitive ratio. To overcome the pessimism typical of worst-case analysis, we also propose a novel learning framework that provides guarantees on the worst-case competitive ratio (i.e., to provide robustness against nonstationarity) while allowing end-to-end differentiable learning of the best algorithm on historical instances of the problem. We evaluate our algorithms in a case study of a grid-integrated data center with battery storage, showing that $\\texttt{PAAD}$ effectively solves the problem and end-to-end learning achieves substantial performance improvements compared to $\\texttt{PAAD}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7ebf\u5e73\u6ed1\u9700\u6c42\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff08OSDM\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPAAD\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7b49\u5927\u578b\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5728\u7535\u7f51\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u50a8\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAAD\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3OSDM\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "PAAD\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u6bd4PAAD\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "PAAD\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval. PCR reduces the average graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent compared to baselines, demonstrating retrieval of more structurally consistent information.

Situations such as job start-ups, checkpoint storms, or heavily skewed namespace access can trigger thousands of concurrent metadata requests against a small subset of servers. The result is long queues, inflated tail latencies, and reduced system throughput. Prior efforts including static namespace partitioning, backend-specific extensions, and kernel-level modifications address parts of the problem, but they often prove too rigid, intrusive to deploy, or unstable under shifting workloads. We present MIDAS, an adaptive middleware layer that operates transparently between clients and metadata servers, requiring no changes to kernels or storage backends. The design brings together three mechanisms: (i) a namespace-aware load balancer that enhances consistent hashing with power-of-d sampling informed by live telemetry, (ii) a cooperative caching layer that preserves backend semantics through leases, invalidations, or adaptive timeouts, and (iii) a self-stabilizing control loop that dynamically adjusts routing aggressiveness and cache lifetimes while avoiding oscillations under bursty workloads. Analysis of the model and controlled experiments show that MIDAS reduces average queue lengths by roughly 23% and mitigates worst-case hotspots by up to 80% when compared to round-robin scheduling. These findings highlight that a stability-aware, middleware-based strategy can provide backend-agnostic improvements to metadata management, enabling better scalability in bursty scenarios, more predictable tail latencies, and stronger overall system performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u5c42MIDAS\u89e3\u51b3\u5143\u6570\u636e\u70ed\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e73\u5747\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5143\u6570\u636e\u70ed\u70b9\u662f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4e91\u5b58\u50a8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55I/O\u7684\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u521a\u6027\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1MIDAS\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u5c42\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u547d\u540d\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u5668\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u7f13\u5b58\u5c42\u548c\u81ea\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u8f6e\u8be2\u8c03\u5ea6\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMIDAS\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea623%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u7f13\u89e380%\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u70ed\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u540e\u7aef\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5c3e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The network updates image states through a Boolean reaction-diffusion mechanism: pixels receive Boolean diffusion from neighboring pixels (diffusion process) and perform local logic updates via trainable gate-level logic kernels (reaction process), forming a reaction-diffusion logic network.\n  A Boolean self-attention mechanism is introduced, using XNOR-based Boolean Query-Key (Q-K) attention to modulate neighborhood diffusion pathways and realize logic attention. We also propose Boolean Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which encodes relative distances by parity-bit flipping to simulate Boolean ``phase'' offsets.\n  The overall structure resembles a Transformer but operates entirely in the Boolean domain.

In (repeatedly-played) multi-player/action strategic-form games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. Furthermore, strong convergence guarantees (i.e., almost sure convergence or weak convergence) are mostly restricted to two-player games. To address this main limitation of reinforcement-based learning in repeatedly-played strategic-form games, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization in multi-player/action strategic-form games. We present an extension of perturbed learning automata (PLA), namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA), in which each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This paper is the second part of this study that analyzes stochastic stability in multi-player/action weakly-acyclic games in the presence of noisy observations. We provide conditions under which convergence is attained (in weak sense) to the set of pure Nash equilibria and payoff-dominant equilibria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement-based learning scheme that addresses convergence in weakly-acyclic games. Lastly, we provide a specialization of the results to the classical Stag-Hunt game, supported by a simulation study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848APLA\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u968f\u673a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6536\u655b\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\u7a84\uff0c\u5f3a\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u591a\u9650\u4e8e\u4e24\u4eba\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u53cd\u590d\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848APLA\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4eba\u6b63\u6548\u7528\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u673a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\uff08\u5f31\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\uff09\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7eaf\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u5360\u4f18\u5747\u8861\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u730e\u9e7f\u535a\u5f08\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u5f31\u65e0\u73af\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The idea with this approach is that by including both the measurement metrics, the convergence of the data into their clusters becomes solidified and more robust. We run the algorithm with some synthetically produced data and also some benchmark data sets obtained from the UCI repository. The results show that the convergence of the data into their respective clusters is more accurate by using both WCD and ICD measurement metrics.

Despite substantial research efforts, conventional diagnostic approaches still face two key challenges. First, these methods predominantly adopt a joint learning paradigm for RCL and FTI to exploit shared information and reduce training time. However, this simplistic integration neglects the causal dependencies between tasks, thereby impeding inter-task collaboration and information transfer. Second, these existing methods primarily focus on point-to-point relationships between instances, overlooking the group nature of inter-instance influences induced by deployment configurations and load balancing. To overcome these limitations, we propose CCLH, a novel root cause analysis framework that orchestrates diagnostic tasks based on cascaded conditional learning. CCLH provides a three-level taxonomy for group influences between instances and incorporates a heterogeneous hypergraph to model these relationships, facilitating the simulation of failure propagation. Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from three microservice benchmarks demonstrate that CCLH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both RCL and FTI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCCLH\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728RCL\u548cFTI\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5ffd\u89c6\u4efb\u52a1\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95f4\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea7\u8054\u6761\u4ef6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684CCLH\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95f4\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4e09\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u8d85\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCCLH\u5728RCL\u548cFTI\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CCLH\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

In a field experiment on a large online labor market, I hired 450 U.S.-based remote workers to complete an image-categorization job assisted by AI recommendations.

I find that workers adopt AI recommendations at lower rates when their reliance on AI is visible to the evaluator, resulting in a measurable decline in task performance. The effects are present despite a conservative design in which workers know that the evaluator is explicitly instructed to assess expected accuracy on the same AI-assisted task. This reduction in AI reliance persists even when the evaluator is reassured about workers' strong performance history on the platform, underscoring how difficult these concerns are to alleviate.

For many average-case problems, there does not currently exist strong evidence via reductions that they are hard. However, we can still attempt to predict their polynomial time tractability by proving lower bounds against restricted classes of algorithms.\n  Geometric approaches to predicting tractability typically study the \\emph{optimization landscape}. For optimization problems with random objectives or constraints, ideas originating in statistical physics suggest we should study the \\emph{overlap} between approximately-optimal solutions. Formally, properties of \\emph{Gibbs measures} and the \\emph{Franz--Parisi potential} imply lower bounds against natural local search algorithms, such as Langevin dynamics. A related theory, the \\emph{Overlap Gap Property (OGP)}, proves rigorous lower bounds against classes of algorithms which are stable functions of their input.\n  A remarkable recent work of Li and Schramm showed that the shortest path problem in random graphs admits lower bounds against a class of stable algorithms, via the OGP. Yet this problem is polynomial time tractable. We further investigate this. We find that both the OGP and the Franz--Parisi potential predict that: (1) local search will fail in the optimization landscape of shortest paths, but (2) local search should succeed in the optimization landscape for shortest path \\emph{trees}, which is true.

This design captures the influence of both observed and unobserved interactions, yielding more stable and personalized explanations.

The state of practice is to have _natural language_ specifications, from which test cases are derived manually - a process that is slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale. _Formal_ specifications, on the other hand, are well-suited for automated test generation, but are tedious to write and maintain. In this work, we propose a two-stage pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap: First, we extract _protocol elements_ from natural-language specifications; second, leveraging a protocol implementation, we synthesize and refine a formal _protocol specification_ from these elements, which we can then use to massively test further implementations.\n  We see this two-stage approach to be superior to end-to-end LLM-based test generation, as 1. it produces an _inspectable specification_ that preserves traceability to the original text; 2. the generation of actual test cases _no longer requires an LLM_; 3. the resulting formal specs are _human-readable_, and can be reviewed, version-controlled, and incrementally refined; and 4. over time, we can build a _corpus_ of natural-language-to-formal-specification mappings that can be used to further train and refine LLMs for more automatic translations.\n  Our prototype, AUTOSPEC, successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our approach on five widely used _internet protocols_ (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP, and ManageSieve) by applying its methods on their _RFC specifications_ written in natural-language, and the recent _I/O grammar_ formalism for protocol specification and fuzzing.

We define the problem of finding an optimal portfolio in two-player zero-sum games and prove that this optimization problem is NP-hard. We demonstrate that several intuitive heuristics-such as using the support of a Nash Equilibrium or building portfolios incrementally - can lead to highly suboptimal solutions. These negative results underscore the problem's difficulty and motivate the need for robust, empirically-validated heuristics.

We posit this failure stems from data corruption creating sharp minima in the loss landscape, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we are the first to apply Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) as a general-purpose, plug-and-play optimizer for offline RL. SAM seeks flatter minima, guiding models to more robust parameter regions.

This works investigates the impact of the order in which the W and FR operator are evaluated and aims to provide a quantitative analysis. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that with a judicious choice of step size and operator ordering, the split scheme can converge to the target distribution faster than the exact WFR flow (in terms of model time). We obtain variational formulae describing the evolution over one time step of both sequential splitting schemes and investigate in which settings the W-FR split should be preferred to the FR-W split.

Specifically, we initiate the study of characterizing the graph families that are $H$-\\emph{testable} in this model. A graph family $\\mathcal{F}$ is $H$-testable if, for every graph $H$, $H$-\\emph{freeness} (that is, not having a subgraph isomorphic to $H$) is testable with one-sided error on all inputs from $\\mathcal{F}$.\n  Czumaj and Sohler showed that for any $H$-testable family of graphs $\\mathcal{F}$, the family of testable properties of $\\mathcal{F}$ has a known characterization, a major goal in the study of property testing. Consequently, characterizing the collection of $H$-testable graph families will not only result in new characterizations, but will also exhaust this method of characterizing testable properties. We believe that our result is a substantial step towards this goal.\n  Czumaj and Sohler further showed that the family of planar graphs is $H$-testable, as is any family of minor-free graphs. In this paper, we provide a sufficient and much broader criterion under which a family of graphs is $H$-testable. As a corollary, we obtain new characterizations for many families of graphs including: families that are closed under taking topological minors or immersions, geometric intersection graphs of low-density objects, euclidean nearest-neighbour graphs with bounded clique number, graphs with bounded crossing number (per edge), graphs with bounded queue- and stack number, and more.\n  The criterion we provide is based on the \\emph{$r$-admissibility} graph measure from the theory of sparse graph families initiated by Nesetril and Ossona de Mendez. Proving that specific families of graphs satisfy this criterion is an active area of research, consequently, the implications of this paper may be strengthened in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u968f\u673a\u90bb\u5c45\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u56fe\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u56fe\u65cfH - \u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u5f97\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u65cf\u65b0\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "Czumaj\u548cSohler\u7814\u7a76\u4e86H - \u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u65cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u523b\u753bH - \u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u65cf\u96c6\u5408\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u65b0\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u7a77\u5c3d\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eNesetril\u548cOssona de Mendez\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u65cf\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684r - \u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u6027\u56fe\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ed9\u51fa\u56fe\u65cfH - \u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u56fe\u65cfH - \u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u65cf\u7684\u65b0\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5982\u62d3\u6251\u5b50\u5f0f\u6216\u6d78\u5165\u5c01\u95ed\u7684\u56fe\u65cf\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u523b\u753b\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5c5e\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u6765\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u52a0\u5f3a\u3002"}}

The dominance of men in AI and DS reinforces gender biases in machine learning systems, creating a feedback loop of inequality. This imbalance is a matter of social and economic justice and an ethical challenge, demanding value-driven diversity.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution \"context stream\" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity \"insight stream\" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAVERY\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62c6\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0VLM\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5728\u6ce2\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u707e\u96be\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u53ef\u67e5\u8be2\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u677f\u8f7dCNN\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\uff0cVLM\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e91\u5378\u8f7d\u5728\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbd\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u62c6\u5206\u5c06VLM\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u673a\u8f7d\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7ba1\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "AVERY\u5728\u6ce2\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad811.2%\uff0c\u6bd4\u5168\u8fb9\u7f18\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u8017\u4f4e93.98%\u3002", "conclusion": "AVERY\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u67e5\u8be2\u667a\u80fd\u3002"}}

A principled benchmarking comparison against nine established metaheuristics on the CEC 2017 and 2021 suites reveals that ETO's performance claims are inflated.

However, existing LLM-based techniques primarily rely on coarse-grained external feedback (e.g.,test results) to guide iterative patch generation, while lacking fine-grained internal signals that reveal why a patch fails or which parts of the generated code are likely incorrect. This limitation often leads to inefficient refinement, error propagation, and suboptimal repair performance. In this work, we propose TokenRepair, a novel two-level refinement framework that enhances APR by integrating internal reflection for localizing potentially faulty tokens with external feedback for quality-aware patch refinement. Specifically, TokenRepair first performs internal reflection by analyzing context-aware token-level uncertainty fluctuations to identify suspicious or low-confidence tokens within a patch.

The paper develops a projection-based influence framework for decentralized PSP auctions. We formalize primary and expanded influence sets using projections on the active bid index set and show how partial orders on bid prices govern allocation, market shifts, and the emergence of saturated one-hop shells. Our results highlight the robustness of PSP auctions in decentralized environments by introducing saturated components and a structured framework for phase transitions in multi-auction dynamics. This structure ensures deterministic coverage of the strategy space, enabling stable and truthful embedding in the larger game.

Linear stress recovery methods, which solve a single geometrically linear equilibrium problem on the imaged, already-loaded geometry, have been validated for static stress estimation, but their robustness to unknown imaging phase remains unexplored. We investigated whether imaging phase materially biases 99th percentile stress recovered linearly, and whether linear recovery agrees with non-linear analysis under matched loads. Two patient-specific AAAs from a public 4D-CTA cohort (Case 1: 5.5% strain; Case 2: 4.5% strain) were analyzed. For each, we analyzed diastolic and synthetic systolic geometry, the latter generated by warping the diastolic mesh via displacements from non-linear hyperelastic analysis. Linear stresses were recovered on both geometries under systolic pressure and compared via 99th-percentile maximum principal stress, stress distributions, and 3D stress differential contours. Linear stresses under pulse pressure were compared against non-linear stresses. 99th-percentile stresses from linear recovery on diastolic vs synthetic systolic geometries under systolic pressure differed by 8.6% (Case 1) and 3.5% (Case 2), within segmentation uncertainty. 99th-percentile stresses from linear recovery and non-linear analysis under pulse pressure agreed closely: 0% difference (Case 1) and 1.1% (Case 2), with nearly identical distributions.

We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.

Its main operation, SConvOp, lowers Linalg convolutions into tiled and packed generic operations through a fully declarative transformation pipeline. The process is guided by a Convolution Slicing Analysis that determines tile sizes and data layout strategies based on input and filter shapes, as well as target architecture parameters. SConvOp handles edge cases by splitting irregular regions and adjusting affine maps where needed. All packing and tiling operations are derived from a parametric set of affine equations, enabling reusable and analyzable transformations. Although functional correctness was the primary goal of this work, the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SConvTransform, achieving good enough performance across different target architectures.

Building on Dirichlet regression, we introduce a split conformal approach based on quantile residuals and a highest-density region strategy that combines a fast coordinate-floor approximation with an internal grid refinement to restore sharpness. Both constructions are model-agnostic at the conformal layer and guarantee finite-sample marginal coverage under exchangeability, while respecting the geometry of the simplex. A comprehensive Monte Carlo study spanning homoscedastic and heteroscedastic designs shows that the quantile residual and grid-refined HDR methods achieve empirical coverage close to the nominal 90\\% level and produce substantially narrower regions than the coordinate-floor approximation, which tends to be conservative. We further demonstrate the methods on household budget shares from the BudgetItaly dataset, using standardized socioeconomic and price covariates with a train, calibration, and test split. In this application, the grid-refined HDR attains coverage closest to the target with the smallest average widths, closely followed by the quantile residual approach, while the simple triangular HDR yields wider, less informative sets. Overall, the results indicate that conformal prediction on the simplex can be both calibrated and efficient, providing practical uncertainty quantification for compositional prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6210\u5206\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u4e3a\u6210\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u6210\u5206\u54cd\u5e94\uff08\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e14\u548c\u4e3a1\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u5206\u88c2\u5171\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u9650\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u6b8b\u5dee\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316HDR\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63a5\u8fd190%\u4e14\u533a\u57df\u66f4\u7a84\uff1b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316HDR\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u4e14\u5e73\u5747\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6821\u51c6\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u6210\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002"}}

This study investigates how emotional arousal, indexed by skin conductance responses,SCR, relates to trust behavior in a modified centipede game. To examine the impact of uncertainty, the game incorporated both fixed and random termination conditions. SCRs were recorded alongside self-reported measures of mutual and general trust and individual risk-taking propensity. Phasic SCRs were significantly higher under random termination, particularly following the opponent take actions, indicating increased emotional arousal under uncertainty. Mutual trust scores correlated positively with risk propensity but not with general trust. Behaviorally, higher mutual trust was associated with extended cooperative play, but only in the fixed-turn condition. These findings suggest that physiological arousal reflects emotional engagement in trust-related decisions and that uncertainty amplifies both arousal and strategic caution.

The aim is to partition the $n$ vertices into a given number $k$ of clusters such that every cluster forms a connected subgraph of $G$ and a given clustering objective gets minimized. The constraint that the clusters are connected has applications in many different fields, like for example community detection and geodesy.\n  So far, $k$-center and $k$-median have been studied in this setting. It has been shown that connected $k$-median is $\u03a9(n^{1- \u03b5})$-hard to approximate which also carries over to the connected $k$-means problem, while for connected $k$-center it remained an open question whether one can find a constant approximation in polynomial time. We answer this question by providing an $\u03a9(\\log^*(k))$-hardness result for the problem. Given these hardness results, we study the problems on graphs with bounded treewidth. We provide exact algorithms that run in polynomial time if the treewidth $w$ is a constant. Furthermore, we obtain constant approximation algorithms that run in FPT time with respect to the parameter $\\max(w,k)$.\n  Additionally, we consider the min-sum-radii (MSR) and min-sum-diameter (MSD) objective. We prove that on general graphs connected MSR can be approximated with an approximation factor of $(3 + \u03b5)$ and connected MSD with an approximation factor of $(4 + \u03b5)$.

To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items.

This problem comes with an added constraint, i.e., of \\emph{monotonicity}, in which whenever a node or an edge is decontaminated, it must not get recontaminated. Hence, the name comes \\emph{monotone decontamination}. This problem has been relatively explored in static graphs, but nothing is known yet in dynamic graphs. We, in this paper, study the \\emph{monotone decontamination} problem in arbitrary dynamic graphs. We designed two models of dynamicity, based on the time within which a disappeared edge must reappear. In each of these two models, we proposed lower bounds as well as upper bounds on the number of agents, required to fully decontaminate the underlying dynamic graph, monotonically. Our results also highlight the difficulties faced due to the sudden disappearance or reappearance of edges.

By regulating physiological and biochemical processes, these mechanisms ensure the stability of an organism's internal environment, enabling it to better adapt to external changes. Among these mechanisms, the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) theory has been extensively studied as a key principle for maintaining the balance of synaptic strengths in biological systems. Despite the extensive development of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as a model for bionic neural networks, no prior work in the machine learning community has integrated biologically plausible BCM formulations into SNNs to provide homeostasis. In this study, we propose a Dynamic Weight Adaptation Mechanism (DWAM) for SNNs, inspired by the BCM theory. DWAM can be integrated into the host SNN, dynamically adjusting network weights in real time to regulate neuronal activity, providing homeostasis to the host SNN without any fine-tuning. We validated our method through dynamic obstacle avoidance and continuous control tasks under both normal and specifically designed degraded conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DWAM not only enhances the performance of SNNs without existing homeostatic mechanisms under various degraded conditions but also further improves the performance of SNNs that already incorporate homeostatic mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7BCM\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff08DWAM\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SNNs\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u6001\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u63d0\u5347SNNs\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u672a\u5c06\u5177\u6709\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684BCM\u516c\u5f0f\u878d\u5165SNNs\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u6001\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u6545\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7BCM\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff08DWAM\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5bbf\u4e3bSNN\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7f51\u7edc\u6743\u91cd\u4ee5\u8c03\u8282\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u907f\u969c\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cDWAM\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7a33\u6001\u673a\u5236SNNs\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5df2\u6709\u7a33\u6001\u673a\u5236SNNs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DWAM\u80fd\u4e3aSNNs\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u6001\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347SNNs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated that various testing activities can be performed automatically by large language models (LLMs) with reasonable accuracy. This paper develops a multi-agent system called MASTEST that combines LLM-based and programmed agents to form a complete tool chain that covers the whole workflow of API test starting from generating unit and system test scenarios from API specification in the OpenAPI Swagger format, to generating of Pytest test scripts, executing test scripts to interact with web services, to analysing web service response messages to determine test correctness and calculate test coverage. The system also supports the incorporation of human testers in reviewing and correcting LLM generated test artefacts to ensure the quality of testing activities. MASTEST system is evaluated on two LLMs, GPT-4o and DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner with five public APIs. The performances of LLMs on various testing activities are measured by a wide range of metrics, including unit and system test scenario coverage and API operation coverage for the quality of generated test scenarios, data type correctness, status code coverage and script syntax correctness for the quality of LLM generated test scripts, as well as bug detection ability and usability of LLM generated test scenarios and scripts. Experiment results demonstrated that both DeepSeek and GPT-4o achieved a high overall performance. DeepSeek excels in data type correctness and status code detection, while GPT-4o performs best in API operation coverage. For both models, LLM generated test scripts maintained 100\\% syntax correctness and only required minimal manual edits for semantic correctness.

In this paper, we relax the aforementioned ``self-interest'' assumption, and initiate the study of algorithmic aspects of bimatrix games -- such as the complexity and the quality of their (approximate) Nash equilibria -- under altruism or spite.

These observations raise a fundamental question: do such correlations simply reflect internal cellular processes, or do they enhance a cell's ability to navigate complex environments? In this work, we explore how temporally correlated noise (modeled using fractional Brownian motion) influences chemotactic search dynamics. Through computational experiments, we show that superdiffusive motion, when combined with gradient-driven migration, enables robust exploration of the chemoattractant landscape. Cells reliably reach the global maximum of the concentration field, even in the presence of spatial noise, secondary cues, or irregular signal geometry. We quantify this behavior by analyzing the distribution of first hitting times under varying degrees of temporal correlation.

This paper proposes a lightweight optimization method that integrates dynamic attention head pruning with knowledge distillation. The approach dynamically evaluates the importance of each attention head in the multi-head attention mechanism using a combination of weight norms and entropy, and prunes redundant heads in real time to reduce computational overhead. To mitigate performance degradation, knowledge distillation transfers information from the original model to the pruned student, enabling the smaller model to preserve reasoning ability. Experiments conducted on both Math23k and ASDiv-A verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, on Math23k with a 30% pruning ratio, parameters are reduced by 18.7%, inference speed is improved by 27.5%, FLOPs are reduced by 19.3%, and accuracy drops only 0.7% (from 84.4% to 83.7%).

However, most results over the past decade have focused on decompositions over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This limitation has lead to either purely heuristic methods, or in applications transforming a graph with cycles into a DAG via preprocessing heuristics. In this paper we show that flow decomposition problems can be solved in practice also on general graphs with cycles, via a framework that yields fast and flexible Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations.\n  Our key technique relies on the graph-theoretic notion of dominator tree, which we use to find all safe sequences of edges, that are guaranteed to appear in some walk of any flow decomposition solution. We generalize previous results from DAGs to cyclic graphs, by showing that maximal safe sequences correspond to extensions of common leaves of two dominator trees, and that we can find all of them in time linear in their size. Using these, we can accelerate MILPs for any flow decomposition into walks in general graphs, by setting to (at least) 1 suitable variables encoding solution walks, and by setting to 0 other walks variables non-reachable to and from safe sequences. This reduces model size and eliminates costly linearizations of MILP variable products.\n  We experiment with three decomposition models (Minimum Flow Decomposition, Least Absolute Errors and Minimum Path Error), on four bacterial datasets. Our pre-processing enables up to thousand-fold speedups and solves even under 30 seconds many instances otherwise timing out. We thus hope that our dominator-based MILP simplification framework, and the accompanying software library can become building blocks in multi-assembly applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u652f\u914d\u6811\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u542b\u73af\u56fe\u7684\u6d41\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7ec6\u83cc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u6d41\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u591a\u805a\u7126\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u542b\u73af\u56fe\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u542b\u73af\u56fe\u7684\u6d41\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u652f\u914d\u6811\u6982\u5ff5\u627e\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5148\u524d\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5230\u542b\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u53d8\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u542b\u73af\u56fe\u7684\u6d41\u5206\u89e3MILP\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec6\u83cc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u5343\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u8bb8\u591a\u539f\u672c\u8d85\u65f6\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u652f\u914d\u6811\u7684MILP\u7b80\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e93\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u591a\u7ec4\u88c5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u3002"}}

Cloud providers meet this demand through GPU-as-a-Service platforms that offer rentable GPU resources for running AI workloads. In this context, the sharing of GPU resources between different tenants is essential to maximize the number of scheduled workloads. Among the various GPU sharing technologies, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) stands out by partitioning GPUs at hardware level into isolated slices with dedicated compute and memory, ensuring strong tenant isolation, preventing resource contention, and enhancing security. Despite these advantages, MIG's fixed partitioning introduces scheduling rigidity, leading to severe GPU fragmentation in multi-tenant environments, where workloads are continuously deployed and terminated. Fragmentation leaves GPUs underutilized, limiting the number of workloads that can be accommodated. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel scheduling framework for MIG-based clouds that maximizes workload acceptance while mitigating fragmentation in an online, workload-agnostic setting. We introduce a fragmentation metric to quantify resource inefficiency and guide allocation decisions. Building on this metric, our greedy scheduling algorithm selects GPUs and MIG slices that minimize fragmentation growth for each incoming workload. We evaluate our approach against multiple baseline strategies under diverse workload distributions. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher workload acceptance rates, leading to an average 10% increase in the number of scheduled workloads in heavy load conditions, while using approximately the same number of GPUs as the benchmark methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9AI\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9GPU\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMIG\u4e91\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u788e\u7247\u6307\u6807\u548c\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9GPU\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u6fc0\u589e\uff0cMIG\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u533a\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u79df\u6237\u73af\u5883\u4e2dGPU\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8c03\u5ea6\u521a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMIG\u4e91\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u788e\u7247\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u7528\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f20\u5165\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9009\u62e9\u4f7f\u788e\u7247\u589e\u957f\u6700\u5c0f\u7684GPU\u548cMIG\u5207\u7247\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\uff0c\u91cd\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u8c03\u5ea6\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6570\u91cf\u5e73\u5747\u589e\u52a010%\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GPU\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11GPU\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3002"}}

Extensive experiments on static (e.g., ImageNet) and neuromorphic (e.g., CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate that our TaWQ maintains high energy efficiency (4.12M, 0.63mJ) while incurring a negligible quantization loss of only 0.22% on ImageNet.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTemporal - adaptive Weight Quantization (TaWQ)\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u6548\u9ad8\u4e14\u91cf\u5316\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u661f\u5f62\u80f6\u8d28\u7ec6\u80de\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u7a81\u89e6\u8c03\u8282\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTaWQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6cbf\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9759\u6001\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cTaWQ\u80fd\u6548\u9ad8\uff084.12M, 0.63mJ\uff09\uff0c\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u91cf\u5316\u635f\u5931\u4ec50.22%\u3002", "conclusion": "TaWQ\u80fd\u5728\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u91cf\u5316\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Regulatory frameworks such as UN regulations, NCAP standards, ISO norms, and NHTSA guidelines impose strict bounds on system reaction times to ensure safe vehicle operation. This paper presents a structured, White-Box methodology based on Event-Chain Modeling to address these timing challenges. Unlike Black-Box approaches, Event-Chain Analysis offers transparent insights into the timing behavior of each functional component - from perception and planning to actuation and human interaction. This perspective is also aligned with multiple regulations, which require that homologation dossiers provide evidence that the chosen system architecture is suitable to ensure compliance with the specified requirements. Our methodology enables the derivation, modeling, and validation of end-to-end timing constraints at the architectural level and facilitates early verification through simulation.

Often, the functional form relating outcome to player attributes or strategy is complex, preventing mathematical progress. In this work, we axiomatically derive a latent space representation for pairwise, symmetric, zero-sum games by seeking a coordinate space in which the optimal training direction for an agent responding to an opponent depends only on their opponent's coordinates. The associated embedding represents the original game as a linear combination of copies of a simple game, the disc game, in a new coordinate space. In this article, we show that disc-game embedding is useful for studying learning dynamics. We demonstrate that a series of classical evolutionary processes simplify to constrained oscillator equations in the latent space. In particular, the continuous replicator equation reduces to a Hamiltonian system of coupled oscillators that exhibit Poincar\u00e9 recurrence. This reduction allows exact, finite-dimensional closure when the underlying game is finite-rank, and optimal approximation otherwise. It also establishes an exact equivalence between the continuous replicator equation and adaptive dynamics in the transformed coordinates. By identifying a minimal rank representation, the disc game embedding offers numerical methods that could decouple the cost of simulation from the number of attributes used to define agents. These results generalize to metapopulation models that mix inhomogeneously, and to any time-differentiable dynamic where the rate of growth of a type, relative to its expected payout, is a nonnegative function of its frequency. We recommend disc-game embedding as an organizing paradigm for learning and selection in response to symmetric two-player zero-sum games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5373\u5706\u76d8\u535a\u5f08\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e24\u4eba\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fdb\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u73a9\u5bb6\u5c5e\u6027\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u5173\u7cfb\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u6570\u5b66\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5750\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u73a9\u5bb6\u5bf9\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5411\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5bf9\u624b\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5706\u76d8\u535a\u5f08\u5d4c\u5165\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u632f\u8361\u5668\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u590d\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d8\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u95ed\u5408\u6216\u6700\u4f18\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u8350\u5706\u76d8\u535a\u5f08\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e24\u4eba\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This problem is especially challenging when multiple, potentially conflicting human values must be considered and balanced. Although several variants of existing alignment methods (such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)) have been proposed to address multi-value alignment, they suffer from notable limitations: 1) they are often unstable and inefficient in multi-value optimization; and 2) they fail to effectively handle value conflicts. As a result, these approaches typically struggle to achieve optimal trade-offs when aligning multiple values.\n  To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Multi-Value Alignment (MVA).

A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature.\n  In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context.

These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links. Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations.

To meet both privacy and responsiveness demands, user data is embedded as vectors and stored in a vector database for fast similarity search. However, most existing vector databases target server-class environments. When ported directly to smartphones, two gaps emerge: (G1) a mismatch between mobile SoC constraints and vector-database assumptions, including tight bandwidth budgets, limited on-chip memory, and stricter data type and layout constraints; and (G2) a workload mismatch, because on-device usage resembles a continuously learning memory, in which queries must coexist with frequent inserts, deletions, and ongoing index maintenance. To address these challenges, we propose AME, an on-device Agentic Memory Engine co-designed with modern smartphone SoCs. AME introduces two key techniques: (1) a hardware-aware, high-efficiency matrix pipeline that maximizes compute-unit utilization and exploits multi-level on-chip storage to sustain high throughput; and (2) a hardware- and workload-aware scheduling scheme that coordinates querying, insertion, and index rebuilding to minimize latency. We implement AME on Snapdragon 8-series SoCs and evaluate it on HotpotQA. In our experiments, AME improves query throughput by up to 1.4x at matched recall, achieves up to 7x faster index construction, and delivers up to 6x higher insertion throughput under concurrent query workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u624b\u673a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAME\u5185\u5b58\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u8fdb\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u624b\u673a\u5b58\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAME\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u4ee3\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u77e9\u9635\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728Snapdragon 8\u7cfb\u5217SoC\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u5728HotpotQA\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cAME\u5728\u5339\u914d\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0b\u67e5\u8be2\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53471.4\u500d\uff0c\u7d22\u5f15\u6784\u5efa\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u5feb7\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u67e5\u8be2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u63d2\u5165\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53476\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AME\u5f15\u64ce\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this family of algorithms, clustering-based multi-swarm algorithms are among the most effective techniques that join the closest particles together to form independent niche swarms that exploit potential promising regions. However, most clustering-based multi-swarms are Euclidean distance-based and only inquire about the potential of one peak within a cluster and thus can lose multiple peaks due to poor resolution. In a bid to improve the peak detection ratio, the current study proposes two enhancements. First, a preliminary local search across initial particles is proposed to ensure that each local region is sufficiently scouted prior to particle collaboration. Secondly, an investigative clustering approach that performs concavity analysis is proposed to evaluate the potential for several sub-niches within a single cluster.

This focus, however, is not without loss: In general, the principal can strictly gain by recommending a complex, possibly correlated, distribution over actions, while preserving incentive compatibility. In this work, we extend the analysis of multi-agent contracts beyond pure Nash equilibria to encompass more general equilibrium notions, including mixed Nash equilibria as well as (coarse-)correlated equilibria (CCE). The latter, in particular, captures the limiting outcome of agents engaged in learning dynamics.\n  Our main result shows that for submodular and, more generally, XOS rewards, such complex recommendations yield at most a constant-factor gain: there exists a contract and a PNE whose utility is within a constant factor of the best CCE achievable by any contract. This provides a black-box lifting: results established against the best PNE automatically apply with respect to the best CCE, with only a constant factor loss. For submodular rewards, we further show how to transform a contract and a PNE of that contract into a new contract such that any of its CCEs gives a constant approximation to the PNE. This yields black-box robustness: up to constant factors, guarantees established for a specific contract and PNE automatically extend to the modified contract and any of its CCEs. We thus expand prior guarantees for multi-agent contracts and lower the barrier to new ones. As an important corollary, we obtain poly-time algorithms for submodular rewards that achieve constant approximations in any CCE, against the best CCE under the best contract. Such worst-case guarantees are provably unattainable for XOS rewards. Finally, we bound the gap between different equilibrium notions for subadditive, supermodular, and general rewards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u7ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u7eaf\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u8350\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ed1\u76d2\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u5b50\u6a21\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u754c\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u5747\u8861\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u7ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u7ea6\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u8350\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\u83b7\u5f97\u4e25\u683c\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u6790\u5230\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u7eaf\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6df7\u5408\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u548c\uff08\u7c97\uff09\u76f8\u5173\u5747\u8861\u7b49\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b50\u6a21\u548cXOS\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u8350\u6536\u76ca\u81f3\u591a\u6709\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b50\u6a21\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u5408\u7ea6\u548c\u5747\u8861\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5f97\u5230\u5b50\u6a21\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u8bc1\u660eXOS\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u754c\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u4e0d\u540c\u5747\u8861\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u7ea6\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u65b0\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u95e8\u69db\u3002"}}

As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\uff08FMEA\uff09\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfFMEA\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u4ee3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\uff08\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff09\u3001\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u5728FMEA\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u65b0\u5174\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002", "result": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u5728FMEA\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u65b0\u5174\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528AI\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c06FMEA\u5d4c\u5165\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

To facilitate research in the field, we introduce the Cognition-aware Egocentric Navigation (CEN) dataset consisting 6 hours of real-world egocentric recordings capturing diverse navigation behaviors in real-world scenarios.

By now, there is a large body of work on this topic; however, while many algorithms can achieve optimal list size in terms of $\u03b1$, all known algorithms must incur error which decays, in some cases quite poorly, with $1 / \u03b1$. In this paper, we ask if this is inherent: is it possible to trade off list size with accuracy in list-decodable learning? More formally, given $\u03b5> 0$, can we can output a slightly larger list in terms of $\u03b1$ and $\u03b5$, but so that one element of this list has error at most $\u03b5$ with the ground truth? We call this problem high-accuracy list-decodable learning. Our main result is that non-trivial high-accuracy guarantees, both information-theoretically and algorithmically, are possible for the canonical setting of list-decodable mean estimation of identity-covariance Gaussians. Specifically, we demonstrate that there exists a list of candidate means of size at most $L = \\exp \\left( O\\left( \\tfrac{\\log^2 1 / \u03b1}{\u03b5^2} \\right)\\right)$ so that one of the elements of this list has $\\ell_2$ distance at most $\u03b5$ to the true mean. We also design an algorithm that outputs such a list with runtime and sample complexity $n = d^{O(\\log L)} + \\exp \\exp (\\widetilde{O}(\\log L))$. We do so by demonstrating a completely novel proof of identifiability, as well as a new algorithmic way of leveraging this proof without the sum-of-squares hierarchy, which may be of independent technical interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, this approach introduces item-side unfairness. Existing studies primarily attribute this issue to the absence of fairness constraints during SFT and attempt to mitigate unfairness via re-weighting and re-ranking methods. In this paper, we find that unfairness arises not only from SFT but also from pre-training, where inherent biases are further amplified during SFT. This finding underscores the failure of current methods to address the root causes of unfairness. Moreover, current methods struggle to preserve satisfactory recommendation performance. To tackle these issues, we propose an Unfair-to-Fair evOlving (UFO) framework using a self-play mechanism, formulating unfairness mitigation as a two-player game. UFO alternates between two player roles: the \\textit{judger}, which identifies unfairness from both pre-training and SFT, and the \\textit{corrector}, which adjusts the LRS to address identified unfairness while preserving recommendation performance. Iterative optimization between these roles enables UFO to completely resolve unfairness.

This work focuses on two fundamental problems: leader election and spanning tree construction. For each problem, we present a constant-size (per edge), local certification scheme, where the conditions available to each node can only refer to the graph induced by its one-hop neighborhood. In particular, we provide certification schemes for leader election in chordal and $K_4$-free dismantlable graphs and for spanning tree construction in dismantlable graphs, assuming a root is given. For chordal graphs, our leader election certification scheme additionally ensures an acyclic orientation, a property that is not generally verifiable using constant-size certificates in arbitrary graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first local certification results tailored to these graph classes, potentially highlighting structural properties useful for verifying additional problems. Finally, we propose an algorithm that automatically transforms any certification scheme into a silent self-stabilizing algorithm (i.e., an algorithm that automatically recovers from faults) by adding only one extra state to the set of states of the certification scheme, assuming a Gouda fair scheduler.

In this report we present GigaEvo, an extensible open-source framework that enables researchers to study and experiment with hybrid LLM-evolution approaches inspired by AlphaEvolve. Our system provides modular implementations of key components: MAP-Elites quality-diversity algorithms, asynchronous DAG-based evaluation pipelines, LLM-driven mutation operators with insight generation and bidirectional lineage tracking, and flexible multi-island evolutionary strategies. In order to assess reproducibility and validate our implementation we evaluate GigaEvo on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: Heilbronn triangle placement, circle packing in squares, and high-dimensional kissing numbers. The framework emphasizes modularity, concurrency, and ease of experimentation, enabling rapid prototyping through declarative configuration.

However, in open-source environments where contributors work remotely and asynchronously, establishing and maintaining these links is often error-prone, time-consuming, and frequently overlooked. Our empirical study of GitHub repositories revealed that 47% of release artifacts lacked traceability links, and 12% contained broken links. To address this gap, we first analyzed release notes to identify their What, Why, and How information and assessed how these align with PRs, commits, and issues. We curated a benchmark dataset consisting of 3,500 filtered and validated traceability link instances. Then, we implemented LLM-based approaches to automatically establish traceability links of three pairs between release note contents & PRs, release note contents & PRs and release note contents & issues. By combining the time proximity feature, the LLM-based approach, e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, achieved a high Precision@1 value of 0.73 for PR traceability recovery.

Existing coordination methods enable agents to reach consensus without a centralized coordinator, but do not provide formal guarantees on system-level objectives such as efficiency or fairness. To address this limitation, we propose an iterative negotiation and oversight framework that augments a decentralized negotiation mechanism with taxation-like oversight. The framework builds upon the trading auction for consensus, enabling noncooperative agents with conflicting preferences to negotiate through asset trading while preserving valuation privacy. We introduce an oversight mechanism, which implements a taxation-like intervention that guides decentralized negotiation toward system-efficient and equitable outcomes while also regulating how fast the framework converges. We establish theoretical guarantees of finite-time termination and derive bounds linking system efficiency and convergence rate to the level of central intervention. A case study based on the collaborative trajectory options program, a rerouting initiative in U.S. air traffic management, demonstrates that the framework can reliably achieve consensus among noncooperative airspace sector managers, and reveals how the level of intervention regulates the relationship between system efficiency and convergence speed.

In this paper, we propose GateRA, a unified framework that introduces token-aware modulation to dynamically adjust the strength of PEFT updates. By incorporating adaptive gating into standard PEFT branches, GateRA enables selective, token-level adaptation, preserving pre-trained knowledge for well-modeled inputs while focusing capacity on challenging cases. Empirical visualizations reveal phase-sensitive behaviors, where GateRA automatically suppresses updates for redundant prefill tokens while emphasizing adaptation during decoding. To promote confident and efficient modulation, we further introduce an entropy-based regularization that encourages near-binary gating decisions. This regularization prevents diffuse update patterns and leads to interpretable, sparse adaptation without hard thresholding. Finally, we present a theoretical analysis showing that GateRA induces a soft gradient-masking effect over the PEFT path, enabling continuous and differentiable control over adaptation. Experiments on multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that GateRA consistently outperforms or matches prior PEFT methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGateRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3aPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165token\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u6301\u5e73\u5148\u524dPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709token\u5e94\u7528\u9759\u6001\u3001\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u6216\u6b20\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGateRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165token\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793aGateRA\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u6291\u5236\u5197\u4f59\u9884\u586b\u5145token\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u6301\u5e73\u5148\u524dPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GateRA\u80fd\u5bf9PEFT\u8def\u5f84\u4ea7\u751f\u8f6f\u68af\u5ea6\u63a9\u7801\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

There are two types of individuals: residents with fitness $1$ and mutants with fitness $r$. Two standard update rules are used in the literature. In Birth-death (Bd), a vertex is chosen to reproduce proportional to fitness, and one of its neighbors is selected uniformly at random to be replaced by the offspring. In death-Birth (dB), a vertex is chosen uniformly to die, and then one of its neighbors is chosen, proportional to fitness, to place an offspring into the vacancy. We formalize and study a unified model, the $\u03bb$-mixed Moran process, in which each step is independently a Bd step with probability $\u03bb\\in [0,1]$ and a dB step otherwise. We analyze this mixed process for undirected, connected graphs. As an interesting special case, we show at $\u03bb=1/2$, for any graph that the fixation probability when $r=1$ with a single mutant initially on the graph is exactly $1/n$, and also at $\u03bb=1/2$ that the absorption time for any $r$ is $O_r(n^4)$. We also show results for graphs that are \"almost regular,\" in a manner defined in the paper. We use this to show that for suitable random graphs from $G \\sim G(n,p)$ and fixed $r>1$, with high probability over the choice of graph, the absorption time is $O_r(n^4)$, the fixation probability is $\u03a9_r(n^{-2})$, and we can approximate the fixation probability in polynomial time. Another special case is when the graph has only two distinct degree values $\\{d_1, d_2\\}$ with $d_1 \\leq d_2$. For those graphs, we give exact formulas for fixation probabilities when $r = 1$ and any $\u03bb$, and establish an absorption time of $O_r(n^4 \u03b1^4)$ for all $\u03bb$, where $\u03b1= d_2 / d_1$.

However, existing methods often overlook two critical factors: irregular user interests between interactions and highly uneven item distributions over time. The former factor implies that actual user preferences are not always continuous, and long-term historical interactions may not be relevant to current purchasing behavior. Therefore, relying only on these historical interactions for recommendations may result in a lack of user interest at the target time. The latter factor, characterized by peaks and valleys in interaction frequency, may result from seasonal trends, special events, or promotions. These externally driven distributions may not align with individual user interests, leading to inaccurate recommendations. To address these deficiencies, we propose TGODE to both enhance and capture the long-term historical interactions. Specifically, we first construct a user time graph and item evolution graph, which utilize user personalized preferences and global item distribution information, respectively. To tackle the temporal sparsity caused by irregular user interactions, we design a time-guided diffusion generator to automatically obtain an augmented time-aware user graph. Additionally, we devise a user interest truncation factor to efficiently identify sparse time intervals and achieve balanced preference inference. After that, the augmented user graph and item graph are fed into a generalized graph neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to align with the evolution of user preferences and item distributions. This allows two patterns of information evolution to be matched over time.

Thesis (2017). Abstract revised in 2025 to comply with arXiv character limits", "summary": "In complex systems with many compute nodes containing multiple CPUs that are coherent within each node, a key challenge is maintaining efficient and correct coherence between nodes. The Unimem system addresses this by proposing a virtualized global address space that enables such coherence, relying on the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) in each node. The goal of this thesis is to support this approach by successfully testing and using the IOMMU of a single node. For this purpose, we used ARM's IOMMU, known as the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Because Linux documentation for the SMMU is limited and unclear, we implemented custom kernel modules to test and use its functionality.\n  First, we tested the SMMU in the Processing System (PS) of the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC by developing a module that inserted virtual-to-physical address mappings into the SMMU. We then triggered a DMA transfer to a virtual address and observed that the request passed through the SMMU for address translation. We repeated this experiment by initiating DMA transactions from the Programmable Logic (PL) and similarly confirmed that the transactions were translated by the SMMU. Finally, we developed a module that enables transactions from the PL without requiring explicit pre-mapping of virtual and physical address pairs. This was achieved by configuring the SMMU with the page table pointer of a user process, allowing it to translate all relevant virtual addresses dynamically.\n  Overall, we successfully demonstrated the correct operation of the SMMU across all tested scenarios.

To address this, we propose the Adaptive Restart-Refine Differential Evolution (ARRDE) algorithm, a new variant of Differential Evolution (DE). ARRDE builds upon the LSHADE algorithm, incorporates key mechanisms from jSO, and introduces a nonlinear population-size reduction strategy combined with an adaptive restart-refine mechanism.\n  We evaluate ARRDE on five benchmark suites (CEC2011, CEC2017, CEC2019, CEC2020, and CEC2022) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most extensive experimental study to date in the context of algorithmic comparison, as most prior works consider only one or two suites. This broad evaluation enables a rigorous assessment of generalization across markedly different problem characteristics. To further support fair cross-suite comparisons, we also introduce a bounded accuracy-based scoring metric derived from relative error. Using both rank-based and accuracy-based metrics, and comparing against algorithms that perform strongly on CEC2017 (e.g., jSO and LSHADE-cnEpSin) as well as those that excel on CEC2020 (e.g., j2020 and NLSHADE-RSP), ARRDE consistently demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking first across all benchmark suites considered.

Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines.

Extensive experiments support our theory: (i) Prediction coverage varies monotonically with the calibration-time attack strength, enabling the use of nonzero calibration-time attack to predictably control coverage under adversarial tests; (ii) target coverage can hold over a range of test-time attacks: with a suitable calibration attack, coverage stays within any chosen tolerance band across a contiguous set of perturbation levels; and (iii) adversarial training at the training stage produces tighter prediction sets that retain high informativeness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5272\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\u5e38\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6821\u51c6\u671f\u95f4\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd8\u8003\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u6d4b\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u968f\u6821\u51c6\u65f6\u95f4\u653b\u51fb\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5408\u9002\u6821\u51c6\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u80fd\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u653b\u51fb\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u96f6\u6821\u51c6\u65f6\u95f4\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9\u6297\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0b\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5408\u9002\u6821\u51c6\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u4f7f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6270\u52a8\u6c34\u5e73\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u76ca\u3002"}}

Identifying the next most informative symptoms to assess, in order to distinguish between possible disorders, presents an additional challenge. This process requires comprehensive knowledge of diagnostic criteria and symptom overlap across disorders, making it difficult to navigate based on symptoms alone. This research aims to develop a recommender system for cognitive disorder diagnosis using binary matrix representations. The core algorithm utilizes a binary matrix of disorders and their symptom combinations. It filters through the rows and columns based on the patient's current symptoms to identify potential disorders and recommend the most informative next symptoms to examine. A prototype of the recommender system was implemented in Python. Using synthetic test and some real-life data, the system successfully identified plausible disorders from an initial symptom set and recommended further symptoms to refine the diagnosis. It also provided additional context on the symptom-disorder relationships. Although this is a prototype, the recommender system shows potential as a clinical support tool.

However, several limitations hinder symbolic execution from application on real-world software. One of the limitations is the inability to solve diverse execution path constraints: traditional symbolic execution based on SMT solvers is difficult to handle execution paths with complex data structures or external API calls. In this paper, we focus on investigating the possibility of adopting large language models (LLM) for path constraint solving instead of traditional solver-based techniques in symbolic execution. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate the ability of LLMs in two types of path constraint solving: generating test inputs to facilitate an execution path, and determining whether a given execution path can be satisfied without triggering any bugs. We build new evaluation pipelines and benchmarks for two tasks: test case generation and path classification, which include data sources from both competition-level programs and real-world repositories. Our experiment results show that state-of-the-art LLMs are able to solve path constraints in both generation and classification tasks, with 60% of generated test cases that accurately cover the given execution path. Moreover, LLMs are capable of improving test coverage by covering execution paths in real-world repositories where traditional symbolic execution tools cannot be applied. These findings highlight the possibility of extending symbolic execution techniques with LLMs in the future to improve the ability and generalizability of symbolic execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLLM\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u8def\u5f84\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u6709\u671b\u6269\u5c55\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eSMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u5916\u90e8API\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u7c7b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u8def\u5f84\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c60%\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8986\u76d6\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u6709\u671b\u7528LLM\u6269\u5c55\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing models often rely on restricted, hand-picked strategy sets, which can overlook critical behavioural pathways. A recent four-strategy framework showed that cheap talk can promote cooperation through local interactions, yet it remained unclear whether modelled strategies might alter these conclusions. Here, we extend this framework to the complete set of eight strategies that naturally arise from communication and decision-making rules. We show that incorporating the full strategy space dramatically changes the evolutionary landscape. Cooperation becomes both more robust and more versatile, driven by novel pathways absent in the restricted model. In particular, we uncover a previously overlooked mechanism in which suspicious cooperation catalyses a cyclic dynamic that sustains cooperation. Conversely, the assumed role of strategic defection in the biased model is fragile, acting mainly as a spoiler rather than a genuine evolutionary attractor. The complete model further reveals a rich spectrum of long-term behaviours, including stable coexistence among up to seven strategies and time-varying patterns of partial coexistence. These results demonstrate that the full strategy space unlocks hidden routes to cooperative behaviour and highlight the importance of comprehensive modelling when explaining the emergence of cooperation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u5c55\u56db\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u5230\u516b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u6539\u53d8\u8fdb\u5316\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u89e3\u9501\u5408\u4f5c\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u53d7\u9650\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u5173\u952e\u884c\u4e3a\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u5b8c\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u56db\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7531\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u516b\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f7f\u5408\u4f5c\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u66f4\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e30\u5bcc\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b8c\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u9501\u5408\u4f5c\u9690\u85cf\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u89e3\u91ca\u5408\u4f5c\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u7efc\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce a reinforcement learning framework that uses a prompt-based evaluation mechanism, incorporating established divergent thinking metrics from creativity research. A base language model is fine-tuned using this framework to reward outputs demonstrating higher novelty through higher degrees of conceptual connectivity.

However, text-attributed graphs (TAGs), in which node information is expressed in natural language, remain underexplored, largely due to the absence of standardized benchmark datasets. In this work, we introduce TAG-AD, a comprehensive benchmark for anomaly node detection on TAGs. TAG-AD leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic anomalous node texts directly in the raw text space, producing anomalies that are semantically coherent yet contextually inconsistent and thus more reflective of real-world irregularities. In addition, TAG-AD incorporates multiple other anomaly types, enabling thorough and reproducible evaluation of graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods. With these datasets, we further benchmark existing unsupervised GNN-based GAD methods as well as zero-shot LLMs for GAD.\n  As part of our zero-shot detection setup, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-assisted, LLM-based zero-shot anomaly detection framework. The framework mitigates reliance on brittle, hand-crafted prompts by constructing a global anomaly knowledge base and distilling it into reusable analysis frameworks. Our experimental results reveal a clear division of strengths: LLMs are particularly effective at detecting contextual anomalies, whereas GNN-based methods remain superior for structural anomaly detection.

Differential privacy (DP) and in particular \\textit{user-level} DP provide a natural formalization of privacy requirements for processing dependent data where each individual provides multiple observations to the dataset. However, dependence introduced, e.g., through repeated measurements challenges the existing statistical theory under DP-constraints. In \\iid{} settings, noisy Winsorized mean estimators have been shown to be minimax optimal for standard (\\textit{item-level}) and \\textit{user-level} DP estimation of a mean $\u03bc\\in \\R^d$. Yet, their behavior on potentially dependent observations has not previously been studied. We fill this gap and show that Winsorized mean estimators can also be used under dependence for bounded and unbounded data, and can lead to asymptotic and finite sample guarantees that resemble their \\iid{} counterparts under a weak notion of dependence. For this, we formalize dependence via log-Sobolev inequalities on the joint distribution of observations. This enables us to adapt the stable histogram by Karwa and Vadhan (2018) to a non-\\iid{} setting, which we then use to estimate the private projection intervals of the Winsorized estimator.

The simplest representation of a pangenome is a set of individual genome sequences. Compared to e.g. sequence graphs, this has the advantage that efficient exact search via indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is possible, that no chimeric sequences are created, and that the results are not influenced by heuristics. However, such an index may report a match in thousands of positions even if these all correspond to the same locus, making downstream analysis unnecessarily expensive. For sufficiently similar sequences (e.g. human chromosomes), a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) can be computed. Since an MSA tends to group similar strings in the same columns, it is likely that a string occurring thousands of times in the pangenome can be described by very few columns in the MSA. We describe a method to tag entries in the BWT with the corresponding column in the MSA and develop an index that can map matches in the BWT to columns in the MSA in time proportional to the output. As a by-product, we can efficiently project a match to a designated reference genome, a capability that current pangenome aligners based on the BWT lack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed9BWT\u6761\u76ee\u6253\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u5c06BWT\u5339\u914d\u6620\u5c04\u5230MSA\u5217\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u6295\u5f71\u5339\u914d\u5230\u6307\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eBWT\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u62a5\u544a\u5927\u91cf\u5bf9\u5e94\u540c\u4e00\u57fa\u56e0\u5ea7\u7684\u5339\u914d\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u6790\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u7ed9BWT\u6761\u76ee\u7528MSA\u5bf9\u5e94\u5217\u6253\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5c06BWT\u5339\u914d\u6620\u5c04\u5230MSA\u5217\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06BWT\u5339\u914d\u6620\u5c04\u5230MSA\u5217\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u6295\u5f71\u5339\u914d\u5230\u6307\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eBWT\u7d22\u5f15\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eBWT\u7684\u5168\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6bd4\u5bf9\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Reusable artifacts are considered more efficient and reliable than developing software components from scratch. However, when faced with a large number of reusable artifacts, developers often struggle to find artifacts that can meet their expected needs. To reduce this burden, retrieval-based and learning-based techniques have been proposed to automate artifact recommendations. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to understand intentions, perform semantic alignment, and recommend usable artifacts. Nevertheless, their effectiveness has not been thoroughly explored. To fill this gap, we construct an intent-driven artifact recommendation benchmark named IntentRecBench, covering three representative open source ecosystems. Using IntentRecBench, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of five popular LLMs and six traditional approaches in terms of precision and efficiency. Our results show that although LLMs outperform traditional methods, they still suffer from low precision and high inference cost due to the large candidate space. Inspired by the ontology-based semantic organization in software engineering, we propose TreeRec, a feature tree-guided recommendation framework to mitigate these issues. TreeRec leverages LLM-based semantic abstraction to organize artifacts into a hierarchical semantic tree, enabling intent and function alignment and reducing reasoning time.

In particular, there is considerable interest in how accurately LLMs can reproduce real human emotions and behaviors, as well as whether such reproductions can function effectively in real-world scenarios. However, existing benchmarks focus primarily on knowledge-based assessment and thus fall short of sufficiently reflecting social interactions and strategic dialogue capabilities. To address these limitations, this work proposes a methodology to quantitatively evaluate the human emotional and behavioral imitation and strategic decision-making capabilities of LLMs by employing a Buy and Sell negotiation simulation. Specifically, we assign different personas to multiple LLMs and conduct negotiations between a Buyer and a Seller, comprehensively analyzing outcomes such as win rates, transaction prices, and SHAP values. Our experimental results show that models with higher existing benchmark scores tend to achieve better negotiation performance overall, although some models exhibit diminished performance in scenarios emphasizing emotional or social contexts. Moreover, competitive and cunning traits prove more advantageous for negotiation outcomes than altruistic and cooperative traits, suggesting that the assigned persona can lead to significant variations in negotiation strategies and results. Consequently, this study introduces a new evaluation approach for LLMs' social behavior imitation and dialogue strategies, and demonstrates how negotiation simulations can serve as a meaningful complementary metric to measure real-world interaction capabilities-an aspect often overlooked in existing benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e70\u5356\u8c08\u5224\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u4eff\u548c\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u8c08\u5224\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u4f1a\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53cd\u6620\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u548c\u6218\u7565\u5bf9\u8bdd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u518d\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e70\u5356\u8c08\u5224\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u80dc\u7387\u3001\u4ea4\u6613\u4ef7\u683c\u548cSHAP\u503c\u7b49\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u8c08\u5224\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f3a\u8c03\u60c5\u611f\u6216\u793e\u4f1a\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u72e1\u733e\u7279\u8d28\u6bd4\u5229\u4ed6\u548c\u5408\u4f5c\u7279\u8d28\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u8c08\u5224\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8c08\u5224\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e92\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8865\u5145\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

A common approach formulates recommendation as a language modeling task, where interaction histories are transformed into prompts and user preferences are learned via supervised fine-tuning. However, these methods operate solely in the textual modality and often miss users' fine-grained interests, especially when shaped by rich visual signals such as product images or movie posters. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by aligning text and vision in a shared semantic space. A prevalent training paradigm applies Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to model user preferences. Yet, two core challenges remain: 1) Imbalanced sample hardness, where random negative sampling causes overfitting on easy examples and under-training on hard ones; 2) Cross-modal semantic bias, where the fixed reference model in DPO prevents the policy model from correcting modality misalignments--especially over long sequences. To address these issues, we propose a Multimodal LLM framework that integrates Hardness-aware and Noise-regularized preference optimization for Recommendation (HaNoRec). Specifically, HaNoRec dynamically adjusts optimization weights based on both the estimated hardness of each training sample and the policy model's real-time responsiveness, prioritizing harder examples. It further introduces Gaussian-perturbed distribution optimization on output logits to enhance cross-modal semantic consistency and reduce modality bias inherited from the reference model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6837\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHaNoRec\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6837\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultimodal LLM\u6846\u67b6HaNoRec\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u65af\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters.\n  This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era.

Targeting robustness of systems with COBOL as input is essential yet challenging. Many business-critical applications are written in COBOL, yet these are typically proprietary legacy applications and their code is unavailable to LLMs for training.

The robustness of the LLM-based system is evaluated by measuring changes in values of individual and aggregate metrics calculated on the system's outputs. Finally, we present a series of dynamic table and chart visualization dashboards that assist in debugging the system's outputs, and monitoring and understanding root causes of the system's sensitivity to input variation.

The Sticker Response Selection (SRS) task aims to select the most contextually appropriate sticker based on the dialogue. However, existing methods typically rely on semantic matching and model emotional and intentional cues separately, which can lead to mismatches when emotions and intentions are misaligned. To address this issue, we propose Emotion and Intention Guided Multi-Modal Learning (EIGML). This framework is the first to jointly model emotion and intention, effectively reducing the bias caused by isolated modeling and significantly improving selection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce Dual-Level Contrastive Framework to perform both intra-modality and inter-modality alignment, ensuring consistent representation of emotional and intentional features within and across modalities. In addition, we design an Intention-Emotion Guided Multi-Modal Fusion module that integrates emotional and intentional information progressively through three components: Emotion-Guided Intention Knowledge Selection, Intention-Emotion Guided Attention Fusion, and Similarity-Adjusted Matching Mechanism.

A classical manifestation is that sample averages of arm rewards under bandit sampling may fail to satisfy a central limit theorem. Lai and Wei's stability condition provides a sufficient, and essentially necessary criterion, for asymptotic normality in bandit problems. While the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm satisfies this stability condition, it is not minimax optimal, raising the question of whether minimax optimality and statistical stability can be achieved simultaneously. In this paper, we analyze the stability properties of a broad class of bandit algorithms that are based on the optimism principle. We establish general structural conditions under which such algorithms violate the Lai-Wei stability criterion. As a consequence, we show that widely used minimax-optimal UCB-style algorithms, including MOSS, Anytime-MOSS, Vanilla-MOSS, ADA-UCB, OC-UCB, KL-MOSS, KL-UCB++, KL-UCB-SWITCH, and Anytime KL-UCB-SWITCH, are unstable. We further complement our theoretical results with numerical simulations demonstrating that, in all these cases, the sample means fail to exhibit asymptotic normality.\n  Overall, our findings suggest a fundamental tension between stability and minimax optimal regret, raising the question of whether it is possible to design bandit algorithms that achieve both.

However, significant challenges persist in handling high-cardinality, heterogeneous, and sparse feature spaces, particularly regarding model scalability and efficiency. We identify two key bottlenecks: (i) Representation Bottleneck: Driven by the high cardinality and dynamic nature of features, model capacity is forced into sparse-activated embedding layers, leading to low-rank representations. This, in turn, triggers phenomena like \"One-Epoch\" and \"Interaction-Collapse,\" ultimately hindering model scalability.(ii) Computational Bottleneck: Integrating all heterogeneous features into a unified model triggers an explosion in the number of feature tokens, rendering traditional attention mechanisms computationally demanding and susceptible to attention dispersion. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce STORE, a unified and scalable token-based ranking framework built upon three core innovations: (1) Semantic Tokenization fundamentally tackles feature heterogeneity and sparsity by decomposing high-cardinality sparse features into a compact set of stable semantic tokens; and (2) Orthogonal Rotation Transformation is employed to rotate the subspace spanned by low-cardinality static features, which facilitates more efficient and effective feature interactions; and (3) Efficient attention that filters low-contributing tokens to improve computional efficiency while preserving model accuracy.

Existing methods address this problem within a filtering-ordering-enumeration framework, in which the enumeration stage recursively matches the query graph against the candidate subgraphs of the data graph. However, the lack of awareness of subgraph structural patterns leads to a costly brute-force enumeration, thereby critically motivating the need for intelligent navigation in subgraph matching. To address this challenge, we propose Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN), a neuro-heuristic framework that transforms brute-force enumeration into neural-guided search by integrating neural navigation mechanisms into the core enumeration process. By preserving heuristic-based completeness guarantees while incorporating neural intelligence, NeuGN significantly reduces the \\textit{First Match Steps} by up to 98.2\\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b50\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u679a\u4e3e\u9636\u6bb5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u63d0\u51faNeuGN\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u66b4\u529b\u679a\u4e3e\u8f6c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5f15\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u9996\u6b21\u5339\u914d\u6b65\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b50\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u679a\u4e3e\u9636\u6bb5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u66b4\u529b\u679a\u4e3e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u667a\u80fd\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeural Graph Navigation (NeuGN) \u795e\u7ecf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u5bfc\u822a\u673a\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6838\u5fc3\u679a\u4e3e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cNeuGN\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u5c06\u9996\u6b21\u5339\u914d\u6b65\u6570\u51cf\u5c1198.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuGN\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b50\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The proposed pTU measures the uncertainty in the interaction between the model and the inputs. It provides insights from the model perspective: if two samples interact with a model in a similar way, then they are considered identically distributed. We also show that the pTU is insensitive to the model architecture. As an application, pTU is used to solve the out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, which is critical to ensure model reliability. Failure to detect OOD input can lead to incorrect and unreliable predictions.

However, sequential split learning suffers from poor scalability, while parallel variants like parallel split learning and split federated learning often incur high server resource overhead due to model duplication and aggregation, and generally exhibit reduced model performance and convergence owing to factors like client drift and lag. To address these limitations, we introduce CycleSL, a novel aggregation-free split learning framework that enhances scalability and performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods. Inspired by alternating block coordinate descent, CycleSL treats server-side training as an independent higher-level machine learning task, resampling client-extracted features (smashed data) to mitigate heterogeneity and drift. It then performs cyclical updates, namely optimizing the server model first, followed by client updates using the updated server for gradient computation. We integrate CycleSL into previous algorithms and benchmark them on five publicly available datasets with non-iid data distribution and partial client attendance.

Existing automated logging tools often overlook the fundamental whether-to-log decision and struggle with the composite nature of logging. In this paper, we propose Autologger, a novel hybrid framework that addresses the complete the end-to-end logging pipeline. Autologger first employs a fine-tuned classifier, the Judger, to accurately determine if a method requires new logging statements. If logging is needed, a multi-agent system is activated. The system includes specialized agents: a Locator dedicated to determining where to log, and a Generator focused on what to log. These agents work together, utilizing our designed program analysis and retrieval tools. We evaluate Autologger on a large corpus from three mature open-source projects against state-of-the-art baselines.

We address this challenge by proposing a two-stage diagnostic framework that enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability. First, we introduce Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR), which guides LLMs to generate structured diagnostic hypotheses by interleaving evidence extraction with logical reasoning grounded in DSM-5 criteria. Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67.

While existing evaluation practices typically focus on distributional similarity (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence) or predictive performance (e.g., Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) accuracy), these approaches fail to assess semantic fidelity, that is, whether models trained on synthetic data follow reasoning patterns consistent with those trained on real data. To address this gap, we introduce the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) Distance, a novel explainability-aware metric that is defined as the cosine distance between the global SHAP attribution vectors derived from classifiers trained on real versus synthetic datasets. By analyzing datasets that span clinical health records with physiological features, enterprise invoice transactions with heterogeneous scales, and telecom churn logs with mixed categorical-numerical attributes, we demonstrate that the SHAP Distance reliably identifies semantic discrepancies that are overlooked by standard statistical and predictive measures. In particular, our results show that the SHAP Distance captures feature importance shifts and underrepresented tail effects that the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real accuracy fail to detect.

In this work, we challenge that perspective by showing that differential privacy can be integrated into a fairness-enhancing pipeline with minimal impact on fairness guarantees. We design a postprocessing algorithm, called DP2DP, that enforces both demographic parity and differential privacy. Our analysis reveals that our algorithm converges towards its demographic parity objective at essentially the same rate (up logarithmic factor) as the best non-private methods from the literature.

However, the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm, a classifying version, offers a fast convergence solution while dimensionality reduction still remains a challenge.

Existing pipelines often rely on translation and monolingual retrieval heuristics, which add computational overhead and noise, degrading performance. This work systematically evaluates four intervention types, namely document translation, multilingual dense retrieval with pretrained encoders, contrastive learning at word, phrase, and query-document levels, and cross-encoder re-ranking, across three benchmark datasets. We find that dense retrieval models trained specifically for CLIR consistently outperform lexical matching methods and derive little benefit from document translation. Contrastive learning mitigates language biases and yields substantial improvements for encoders with weak initial alignment, and re-ranking can be effective, but depends on the quality of the cross-encoder training data. Although high-resource languages still dominate overall performance, gains over lexical and document-translated baselines are most pronounced for low-resource and cross-script pairs.

However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters.

To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark, the first of its kind, designed to catalyze progress in automated scientific visualization. It consists of 3,000 research papers paired with their corresponding high-quality ground-truth diagrams and is accompanied by a three-tiered evaluation metric assessing semantic accuracy, layout coherence, and visual quality. Furthermore, to establish a strong baseline on this new benchmark, we propose Paper2SysArch, an end-to-end system that leverages multi-agent collaboration to convert papers into structured, editable diagrams. To validate its performance on complex cases, the system was evaluated on a manually curated and more challenging subset of these papers, where it achieves a composite score of 69.0. This work's principal contribution is the establishment of a large-scale, foundational benchmark to enable reproducible research and fair comparison. Meanwhile, our proposed system serves as a viable proof-of-concept, demonstrating a promising path forward for this complex task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u56fe\u624b\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e3b\u89c2\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b64\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u63d0\u51faPaper2SysArch\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u542b3000\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fe\u8868\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e09\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edfPaper2SysArch\u3002", "result": "Paper2SysArch\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u624b\u52a8\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u7efc\u5408\u5f97\u520669.0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, UOT requires a predefined ground transport cost, which may misrepresent the data's underlying geometry. Choosing such a cost is particularly challenging when datasets live in heterogeneous spaces, often motivating practitioners to adopt Gromov-Wasserstein formulations. To address this challenge, we introduce cost-regularized unbalanced optimal transport (CR-UOT), a framework that allows the ground cost to vary while allowing mass creation and removal. We show that CR-UOT incorporates unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein type problems through families of inner-product costs parameterized by linear transformations, enabling the matching of measures or point clouds across Euclidean spaces. We develop algorithms for such CR-UOT problems using entropic regularization and demonstrate that this approach improves the alignment of heterogeneous single-cell omics profiles, especially when many cells lack direct matches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6210\u672c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08CR - UOT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u8ba9\u5730\u9762\u6210\u672c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08UOT\uff09\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5730\u9762\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5224\u6570\u636e\u6f5c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u7a7a\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u6210\u672c\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CR - UOT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u5185\u79ef\u6210\u672c\u65cf\u7eb3\u5165\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861Gromov - Wasserstein\u7c7b\u578b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u7ec6\u80de\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "CR - UOT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3UOT\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5730\u9762\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation. Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval. This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts. Fine-tuning is found to lead to performance gains only when the training and test data are of similar format. These outcomes underline the need for more balanced multilingual and cross-lingual training and evaluation resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67e5\u8be2\u957f\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u51e0\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u67e5\u8be2\u957f\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u5fc5\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u6536\u76ca\uff1b\u8bed\u8a00\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e66\u5199\u4f53\u7cfb\u95f4\u68c0\u7d22\u5dee\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Traditional federated learning often lacks personalization, as a single global model cannot capture client-specific characteristics, leading to biased predictions and poor generalization, especially for clients with highly divergent data distributions.\n  To address these issues, we propose FedSTAR, a style-aware federated learning framework that disentangles client-specific style factors from shared content representations. FedSTAR aggregates class-wise prototypes using a Transformer-based attention mechanism, allowing the server to adaptively weight client contributions while preserving personalization.\n  Furthermore, by exchanging compact prototypes and style vectors instead of full model parameters, FedSTAR significantly reduces communication overhead.

With the rise of AI-generated bug reports, little work exists to help bug hunters understand why these reports are labeled as invalid. To improve report quality and reduce reviewers' burden, it is critical to predict invalid reports and interpret invalid reasons.\n  In this work, we conduct an empirical study with the purpose of helping bug hunters understand the validity of reports. We collect a dataset of 9,942 disclosed bug bounty reports, including 1,400 invalid reports, and evaluate whether state-of-the-art large language models can identify invalid reports. While models such as GPT-5, DeepSeek, and a fine-tuned RoBERTa achieve strong overall accuracy, they consistently struggle to detect invalid cases, showing a tendency to over-accept reports. To improve invalidity detection, we build a taxonomy of rejection reasons for Information Disclosure vulnerabilities and incorporate it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. This approach substantially improves classification consistency and reduces bias. We also examine whether reviewer decisions may be influenced by factors beyond the content of the report. Our analysis shows that reporters with higher reputations tend to receive more favorable outcomes in borderline cases, suggesting that perceived expertise can influence review judgments.\n  Overall, our findings highlight the challenges of invalid report identification and show that combining LLMs with structured reviewer knowledge can support more transparent and consistent vulnerability report review.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u6f0f\u6d1e\u730e\u624b\u7406\u89e3\u62a5\u544a\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u65e0\u6548\u62a5\u544a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u878d\u5165RAG\u6846\u67b6\u6539\u8fdb\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u58f0\u8a89\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u5ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u751f\u6210\u6f0f\u6d1e\u62a5\u544a\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e2e\u52a9\u6f0f\u6d1e\u730e\u624b\u7406\u89e3\u62a5\u544a\u65e0\u6548\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u9884\u6d4b\u65e0\u6548\u62a5\u544a\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51cf\u8f7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c69942\u4efd\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8d4f\u91d1\u62a5\u544a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30GPT - 5\u3001DeepSeek\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684RoBERTa\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u6f0f\u6d1e\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5e76\u878d\u5165RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u58f0\u8a89\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u96be\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6548\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u6613\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a5\u53d7\u62a5\u544a\uff1bRAG\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u58f0\u8a89\u9ad8\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u66f4\u6613\u83b7\u6709\u5229\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc6\u522b\u65e0\u6548\u62a5\u544a\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u5ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u62a5\u544a\u8bc4\u5ba1\u3002"}}

Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) offer a personalized solution to enhance user experience, yet barriers to adoption remain. Understanding user preferences and trade-offs is essential to ensure widespread acceptance of adaptation designs. This study identifies key factors influencing user preferences and trade-offs in mHealth adaptation design. A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was conducted with 186 participants who have chronic diseases and use mHealth applications. Participants were asked to select preferred adaptation designs from choices featuring six attributes with varying levels. A mixed logit model was used to analyze preference heterogeneity and determine the factors most likely influencing adoption. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed to explore differences by age, gender, health conditions, and coping mechanisms. Maintaining usability while ensuring controllability over adaptations, infrequent adaptations, and small-scale changes are key factors that facilitate the adoption of adaptive mHealth app designs.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Non-stationary and Varying-discounting MDP (NVMDP) framework, which naturally accommodates non-stationarity and allows discount rates to vary with time and transitions. Infinite-horizon, stationary MDPs emerge as special cases of NVMDPs for identifying an optimal policy, and finite-horizon MDPs are also subsumed within the NVMDP formulations. Moreover, NVMDPs provide a flexible mechanism to shape optimal policies, without altering the state space, action space, or the reward structure. We establish the theoretical foundations of NVMDPs, including assumptions, state- and action-value formulation and recursion, matrix representation, optimality conditions, and policy improvement under finite state and action spaces. Building on these results, we adapt dynamic programming and generalized Q-learning algorithms to NVMDPs, along with formal convergence proofs. For problems requiring function approximation, we extend the Policy Gradient Theorem and the policy improvement bound in Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), offering proofs in both scalar and matrix forms. Empirical evaluations in a non-stationary gridworld environment demonstrate that NVMDP-based algorithms successfully recover optimal trajectories under multiple reward and discounting schemes, whereas original Q-learning fails. These results collectively show that NVMDPs provide a theoretically sound and practically effective framework for reinforcement learning, requiring only minor algorithmic modifications while enabling robust handling of non-stationarity and explicit optimal policy shaping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNVMDP\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u975e\u5e73\u7a33MDP\u7b97\u6cd5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5e73\u7a33MDP\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u516c\u5f0f\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNVMDP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49Q\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "NVMDP\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u539fQ\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "NVMDP\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5c0f\u4fee\u6539\u5c31\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u5851\u9020\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant.

Patients' needs evolve dynamically with their health progression, adherence, and caregiver support, creating unique requirements engineering (RE) challenges that traditional approaches often overlook. This study introduces ChroniUXMag, a framework for eliciting and analysing inclusivity requirements in mHealth design. Building on InclusiveMag and GenderMag principles, the framework aims to help researchers and practitioners systematically capture and evaluate factors that influence how individuals with chronic conditions perceive, trust, and interact with mHealth systems. The framework was developed through two stages of the InclusiveMag process. In the first stage, inclusivity facets were identified through a systematic literature review, focus groups, interviews, and a large-scale survey. In the second stage, these facets were synthesised into personas representing diverse health situations, attitudes, and digital practices, and integrated into an adapted cognitive walkthrough form. Thirteen facets were identified that capture the socio-technical complexity of mHealth use, including trust, digital literacy, dependency, and cultural context.

We address this through empirical analysis of activation steering across 50 behaviors that span persona archetypes, personality traits, misalignment behaviors, style cues, and impersonation of public figures. We present a set of comprehensive experiments on coefficient optimization, vector properties, and data requirements to provide comprehensive guidance for the implementation of activation steering. Our analysis demonstrates that steering effectiveness varies significantly by behavior type, with different behavioral categories exhibiting distinct response patterns to intervention strength. We find that trait expression follows an inverted-U curve with a steering coefficient strength. We also show that vector separation metrics do not predict steering success, but larger training datasets enable more aggressive steering.

While conceptually simple, this design incurs substantial overhead. The intermediate logits tensor, with dimensions proportional to batch size, sequence length, and vocabulary size, must be fully materialized in GPU memory, even though only one target token per position is ultimately used. This leads to significant memory footprint and bandwidth comsumption, limiting scalability and slowing training throughput.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel approach to integrates the output projection and loss prediction into a single operation. By directly computing the loss from hidden states and target tokens, our approach bypasses explicit logits materialization. This design reduces memory usage and alleviates bandwidth pressure. Experiments on LLM training demonstrate that our method achieves substantial memory savings and measurable speedups compared to the standard two-stage pipeline, enabling large batch sizes and longer sequences without sacrificing accuracy.

Compared with standard nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV), the additional observed covariates facilitate causal identification and enables heterogeneous causal effect estimation. However, the presence of observed covariates introduces two challenges for its theoretical analysis. First, it induces a partial identity structure, which renders previous NPIV analyses - based on measures of ill-posedness, stability conditions, or link conditions - inapplicable. Second, it imposes anisotropic smoothness on the structural function. To address the first challenge, we introduce a novel Fourier measure of partial smoothing; for the second challenge, we extend the existing kernel 2SLS instrumental variable algorithm with observed covariates, termed KIV-O, to incorporate Gaussian kernel lengthscales adaptive to the anisotropic smoothness. We prove upper $L^2$-learning rates for KIV-O and the first $L^2$-minimax lower learning rates for NPIV-O. Both rates interpolate between known optimal rates of NPIV and nonparametric regression (NPR). Interestingly, we identify a gap between our upper and lower bounds, which arises from the choice of kernel lengthscales tuned to minimize a projected risk.

These errors are hard for LLMs to spot and can have large behavioural effects; yet when asked to summarise code, LLMs can frequently surface high-level intent and sometimes overlook this low-level noise. Motivated by this, we propose summary-mediated repair, a prompt-only pipeline for program repair that leverages natural-language code summarisation as an explicit intermediate step, extending previous work that has already shown code summarisation to be a useful intermediary for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method across eight production-grade LLMs on two function level benchmarks (HumanEvalPack and MBPP), comparing several summary styles against a direct repair baseline. Error-aware diagnostic summaries consistently yield the largest gains - repairing up to 65% of unseen errors, on average of 5% more than the baseline - though overall improvements are modest and LLM-dependent.

A word is defined as a maximal block of non-space symbols. Within this symbol-level framework, which assumes no morphology, syntax, or semantics, we derive several structural results. First, word lengths follow a geometric distribution governed solely by the probability of the space symbol. Second, the expected number of words of a given length, and the expected number of distinct words of that length, admit closed-form expressions based on a coupon-collector argument. This yields a critical word length k* at which word types transition from appearing many times on average to appearing at most once. Third, combining the exponential growth of the number of possible strings of length k with the exponential decay of the probability of each string, we obtain a Zipf-type rank-frequency law p(r) proportional to r^{-alpha}, with an exponent determined explicitly by the alphabet size and the space probability.\n  Our contribution is twofold. Mathematically, we give a unified derivation linking word lengths, vocabulary growth, critical length, and rank-frequency structure in a single explicit model. Conceptually, we argue that this provides a structurally grounded null model for both natural-language word statistics and token statistics in large language models.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), constrained by their local receptive fields, often struggle to capture complex global anatomical structures. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel hybrid architecture, HyM-UNet, designed to synergize the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the efficient global modeling capabilities of Mamba. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical Encoder that utilizes convolutional modules in the shallow stages to preserve high-frequency texture details, while introducing Visual Mamba modules in the deep stages to capture long-range semantic dependencies with linear complexity. To bridge the semantic gap between the encoder and the decoder, we propose a Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection (MGF-Skip). This module leverages deep semantic features as gating signals to dynamically suppress background noise within shallow features, thereby enhancing the perception of ambiguous boundaries. We conduct extensive experiments on public benchmark dataset ISIC 2018.

Through systematic assessment of nine frontier models including GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Gemini 3 Pro Preview using the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence, we identify a paradox that challenges the foundations of cross-substrate cognitive evaluation. Our results show that models achieving above-average human IQ scores ranging from 85.0 to 121.4 simultaneously exhibit binary accuracy rates approaching zero on crystallized knowledge tasks, with an overall judge-binary correlation of r = 0.175 (p = 0.001, n = 1800). This disconnect appears most strongly in the crystallized intelligence domain, where every evaluated model achieved perfect binary accuracy while judge scores ranged from 25 to 62 percent, which cannot occur under valid measurement conditions. Using statistical analyses including Item Response Theory modeling, cross-vendor judge validation, and paradox severity indexing, we argue that this disconnect reflects a category error in applying biological cognitive architectures to transformer-based systems.

Most existing methods typically model the brain as a flat network, ignoring its modular structure, and their attention mechanisms treat all brain region connections equally, ignoring distance-related node connection patterns. However, brain information processing is a hierarchical process that involves local and long-range interactions between brain regions, interactions between regions and sub-functional modules, and interactions among functional modules themselves. This hierarchical interaction mechanism enables the brain to efficiently integrate local computations and global information flow, supporting the execution of complex cognitive functions. To address this issue, we propose BrainHGT, a hierarchical Graph Transformer that simulates the brain's natural information processing from local regions to global communities. Specifically, we design a novel long-short range attention encoder that utilizes parallel pathways to handle dense local interactions and sparse long-range connections, thereby effectively alleviating the over-globalizing issue. To further capture the brain's modular architecture, we designe a prior-guided clustering module that utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to group brain regions into functional communities and leverage neuroanatomical prior to guide the clustering process, thereby improving the biological plausibility and interpretability.

We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive.

Using the METABRIC breast cancer cohort, we studied whether directly modeling the joint relationship between clinical and genomic machine learning risk scores could improve risk stratification for 5-year cancer-specific mortality. We created a binary 5-year cancer-death outcome and defined two sets of predictors: a clinical set (demographic, tumor, and treatment variables) and a genomic set (gene-expression $z$-scores). We trained several supervised classifiers, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and used 5-fold cross-validated predicted probabilities as unbiased risk scores. These scores were converted to pseudo-observations on $(0,1)^2$ to fit Gaussian, Clayton, and Gumbel copulas. Clinical models showed good discrimination (AUC 0.783), while genomic models had moderate performance (AUC 0.681). The joint distribution was best captured by a Gaussian copula (bootstrap $p=0.997$), which suggests a symmetric, moderately strong positive relationship. When we grouped patients based on this relationship, Kaplan-Meier curves showed clear differences: patients who were high-risk in both clinical and genomic scores had much poorer survival than those high-risk in only one set.

Using intrinsics to vectorize core code blocks is a standard optimization method in high-performance libraries, often requiring specific vector optimization implementations for multiple mainstream architectures. The promising RISC-V software ecosystem has a significant demand for algorithm library migration and adaptation. Translating existing intrinsic functions to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsic functions across architectures is currently a mainstream approach. Rule-based intrinsic mapping methods and LLM-based code generation can help developers address the code migration challenge. However, existing intrinsic code benchmarks focus on mainstream SIMD intrinsics and lack support for the emerging RISC-V architecture. There is currently no benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the intrinsic migration capabilities for the RVV extension. To fill this gap, we propose VecIntrinBench, the first intrinsic benchmark encompassing RVV extensions. It includes 50 function-level tasks from open source repositories, implemented as scalars, RVV intrinsics, Arm Neon intrinsics, and x86 intrinsics, along with comprehensive functional and performance test cases. We systematically evaluated various code migration approaches on VecIntrinBench, yielding a series of insightful findings.

Computational modeling provides a quantitative framework for accelerating this understanding, but faces a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and high-fidelity modeling. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Energy-based Autoregressive Generation (EAG) framework that employs an energy-based transformer learning temporal dynamics in latent space through strictly proper scoring rules, enabling efficient generation with realistic population and single-neuron spiking statistics. Evaluation on synthetic Lorenz datasets and two Neural Latents Benchmark datasets (MC_Maze and Area2_bump) demonstrates that EAG achieves state-of-the-art generation quality with substantial computational efficiency improvements, particularly over diffusion-based methods.

The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable.

Due to their vital role in the DL ecosystem, ensuring their reliability and security is critical.

In this paper, we proposed OATest, a novel approach for synthesizing optimization-aware computational graphs. The approach combines patterns extracted from documented tests for optimization and incorporates them into seed computational graphs, enabling broader exploration of optimization paths. To guarantee the optimization-awareness of generated graphs, OATest introduces the edges reusing strategy to establish strong connections between patterns and contexts. Additionally, to solve the validity challenge for the generated graphs, OATest employs an auxiliary layers addition strategy to resolve broken constraints. Equipped with two distinct test oracles, OATest applies differential testing to evaluate the two widely used DL compilers (i.e., TVM and ONNXRuntime). Our experimental results show that OATest outperforms the state-of-the-art method by detecting more bugs and achieving higher code coverage in TVM and ONNXRutimes.

Building upon MAPPO, it samples actions through two independently parameterized networks and cascades the user-intent network into the trajectory network to maintain action dependencies.

This framework generates physiologically plausible athlete profiles, simulates individualized training programs that incorporate periodization and load-management principles, and integrates daily-life factors such as sleep quality, stress levels, and recovery states. We evaluated machine learning models (LASSO, Random Forest, and XGBoost) showing high predictive performance (AUC up to 0.86), identifying sleep disturbances, heart rate variability, and stress as critical early indicators of injury risk. This wearable-driven approach not only enhances injury prediction accuracy but also provides a practical solution to overcoming real-world data limitations, offering a pathway toward a holistic, context-aware athlete monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u94c1\u4eba\u4e09\u9879\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u635f\u4f24\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u94c1\u4eba\u4e09\u9879\u635f\u4f24\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d1f\u8377\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u7761\u7720\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u538b\u529b\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9488\u5bf9\u94c1\u4eba\u4e09\u9879\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u6863\u6848\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u5212\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LASSO\u3001Random Forest\u548cXGBoost\u7b49\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUC\u8fbe0.86\uff09\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7761\u7720\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u538b\u529b\u662f\u635f\u4f24\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65e9\u671f\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u635f\u4f24\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u5168\u9762\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff08MACF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9762\u5411\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237 - \u9879\u76ee\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u76f8\u4f3c\u7528\u6237\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u9879\u76ee\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u592e\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u62db\u52df\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u6307\u4ee4\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u7528\u6237\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMACF\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MACF\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Through systematic experimentation with GPT-2 fine tuned on The Psychology of Artificial Superintelligence, we evaluate seven locality configurations ranging from fully distributed to strictly localist, with five progressive schedules implementing polynomial increases (linear through quintic). Our key finding is that late-layer localization is critical for AI safety applications: the progressive quintic schedule achieves perplexity of 14.64, only 1.89 times worse than the fully distributed baseline while providing interpretable attention patterns in output layers where safety-critical decisions are made. This represents an 84.2% improvement over previous localist implementations and narrows the performance gap from 6.6 times to 1.89 times.

This study investigates the use of deep generative models to synthesize realistic MALDI-TOF MS spectra, aiming to overcome data scarcity and support the development of robust machine learning tools in microbiology.\n  We adapt and evaluate three generative models, Variational Autoencoders (MALDIVAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (MALDIGANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MALDIffusion), for the conditional generation of microbial spectra guided by species labels. Generation is conditioned on species labels, and spectral fidelity and diversity are assessed using diverse metrics.\n  Our experiments show that synthetic data generated by MALDIVAE, MALDIGAN, and MALDIffusion are statistically and diagnostically comparable to real measurements, enabling classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic samples to reach performance levels similar to those trained on real data. While all models faithfully reproduce the peak structure and variability of MALDI-TOF spectra, MALDIffusion obtains this fidelity at a substantially higher computational cost, and MALDIGAN shows competitive but slightly less stable behaviour.

Preliminary efforts have been made to identify AI capabilities in mobile software; however, existing approaches mainly rely on manual inspection and rule-based heuristics. These methods are not only costly and time-consuming but also struggle to adapt advanced AI techniques.\n  To address the limitations of existing methods, we propose LLMAID (Large Language Model for AI Discovery).

Our experiments show that LLM4AID achieves high precision and recall, both exceeding 90%, in detecting AI-related components. Additionally, a user study indicates that developers find the AI service summaries generated by LLMAID to be more informative and preferable to the original app descriptions.

While significant progress has been made in architecture design (e.g., SIREN, FFC, KAN-based INRs) and optimization strategies (meta-learning, amortization, distillation), existing approaches still suffer from two core limitations: (1) a representation bottleneck that forces a single MLP to uniformly model heterogeneous local structures, and (2) limited scalability due to the absence of a hierarchical mechanism that dynamically adapts to signal complexity. This work introduces Hyper-Coordinate Implicit Neural Representations (HC-INR), a new class of INRs that break the representational bottleneck by learning signal-adaptive coordinate transformations using a hypernetwork. HC-INR decomposes the representation task into two components: (i) a learned multiscale coordinate transformation module that warps the input domain into a disentangled latent space, and (ii) a compact implicit field network that models the transformed signal with significantly reduced complexity. The proposed model introduces a hierarchical hypernetwork architecture that conditions coordinate transformations on local signal features, enabling dynamic allocation of representation capacity. We theoretically show that HC-INR strictly increases the upper bound of representable frequency bands while maintaining Lipschitz stability.

Each reverse denoising step, with its associated spring stiffness, can be interpreted as one step of a stochastic differential equation with an effective time step set jointly by the noise schedule and that stiffness. The learned score then plays the role of the drift, equivalently the gradient of a learned energy, yielding a precise correspondence between diffusion sampling and Langevin time evolution.\n  This equivalence recasts molecular dynamics (MD) in terms of diffusion models. Accuracy is no longer tied to a fixed, extremely small MD time step; instead, it is controlled by two scalable knobs: model capacity, which governs how well the drift is approximated, and the number of denoising steps, which sets the integrator resolution. In practice, this leads to a fully data-driven MD framework that learns forces from uncorrelated equilibrium snapshots, requires no hand-engineered force fields, uses no trajectory data for training, and still preserves the Boltzmann distribution associated with the learned energy.\n  We derive trajectory-level, information-theoretic error bounds that cleanly separate discretization error from score-model error, clarify how temperature enters through the effective spring, and show that the resulting sampler generates molecular trajectories with MD-like temporal correlations, even though the model is trained only on static configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5e26\u6279\u7ef4\u5ea6\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u6b20\u963b\u5c3c\u6717\u4e4b\u4e07\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6b27\u62c9 - \u4e38\u5c71\u79ef\u5206\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u94f8\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4e0e\u6b27\u62c9 - \u4e38\u5c71\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63a8\u5bfc\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u529b\u573a\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u6709\u7c7b\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u94f8\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

A Systematic Evaluation with Symbolic Execution", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Obfuscation poses a persistent challenge for software engineering tasks such as program comprehension, maintenance, testing, and vulnerability detection. While compiler optimizations and third-party code often introduce transformations that obscure program intent, existing analysis tools and large language models (LLMs) struggle to recover the original semantics. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs, when fine-tuned with symbolic execution artifacts, can effectively deobfuscate programs and restore analyzability. We construct a benchmark by applying four widely studied transformations-control-flow flattening, opaque predicates, arithmetic encoding, and branch encoding-across diverse C programs from TUM Obfuscation Benchmarks, the LLVM test suite, and algorithmic repositories. We then compare three state-of-the-art LLMs under two training configurations: baseline fine-tuning on obfuscated/original code pairs, and enhanced fine-tuning with additional KLEE artifacts such as SMT constraints, path statistics, and test cases. Our evaluation examines syntactic correctness (compilation success), semantic fidelity (behavioral equivalence under symbolic execution), and code quality (readability and structure). Results show that GPT-4.1-mini achieves the strongest deobfuscation overall, and that incorporating KLEE artifacts consistently improves semantic preservation and compilation success across models. These findings highlight deobfuscation as a broader software engineering concern, demonstrating that combining LLMs with symbolic execution can strengthen automated testing, static analysis, and program comprehension in the presence of obfuscation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u5de5\u4ef6\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPT - 4.1 - mini\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u52a9\u529b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u6df7\u6dc6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cdC\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5e94\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u6df7\u6dc6\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53e5\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "GPT - 4.1 - mini\u6574\u4f53\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u6548\u679c\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408KLEE\u5de5\u4ef6\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u662f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u52a0\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Although graph neural networks that leverage neuroimaging data have shown promise in depression diagnosis, existing approaches are predominantly data-driven and operate largely as black-box models, lacking neurobiological interpretability. Here, we present NH-GCAT (Neurocircuitry-Inspired Hierarchical Graph Causal Attention Networks), a novel framework that bridges neuroscience domain knowledge with deep learning by explicitly and hierarchically modeling depression-specific mechanisms at different spatial scales. Our approach introduces three key technical contributions: (1) at the local brain regional level, we design a residual gated fusion module that integrates temporal blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics with functional connectivity patterns, specifically engineered to capture local depression-relevant low-frequency neural oscillations; (2) at the multi-regional circuit level, we propose a hierarchical circuit encoding scheme that aggregates regional node representations following established depression neurocircuitry organization, and (3) at the multi-circuit network level, we develop a variational latent causal attention mechanism that leverages a continuous probabilistic latent space to infer directed information flow among critical circuits, characterizing disease-altered whole-brain inter-circuit interactions. Rigorous leave-one-site-out cross-validation on the REST-meta-MDD dataset demonstrates NH-GCAT's state-of-the-art performance in depression classification, achieving a sample-size weighted-average accuracy of 73.3\\% and an AUROC of 76.4\\%, while simultaneously providing neurobiologically meaningful explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNH - GCAT\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5728\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4e14\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\u591a\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNH - GCAT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u8111\u533a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6b8b\u5dee\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u5728\u591a\u533a\u57df\u56de\u8def\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u56de\u8def\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u5728\u591a\u56de\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u5f00\u53d1\u53d8\u5206\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728REST - meta - MDD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e25\u683c\u7559\u4e00\u7ad9\u70b9\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u5927\u5c0f\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe73.3%\uff0cAUROC\u4e3a76.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "NH - GCAT\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

We introduce a new smoothed agnostic learning framework for Boolean inputs, where perturbations are modeled via random bit flips.

Under strictly subexponential assumptions on the input distribution, we give an efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces in this model, with runtime and sample complexity approximately n raised to a poly(1/(sigma * epsilon)) factor.

However, the current FI method and tools have a significant limitation in that they require manual identification of FI attributes, including fault type, location and time. The more complex the system, the more expensive, time-consuming and labour-intensive the process. To address the aforementioned challenge, a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted fault test cases (TCs) generation approach for utilization during real-time FI tests is proposed in this paper. To this end, considering the representativeness and coverage criteria, the applicability of various LLMs to create fault TCs from the functional safety requirements (FSRs) has been investigated. Through the validation results of LLMs, the superiority of the proposed approach utilizing gpt-4o in comparison to other state-of-the-art models has been demonstrated. Specifically, the proposed approach exhibits high performance in terms of FSRs classification and fault TCs generation with F1-score of 88% and 97.5%, respectively. To illustrate the proposed approach, the generated fault TCs were executed in real time on a hardware-in-the-loop system, where a high-fidelity automotive system model served as a case study.

Prior work typically focuses on single-load forecasters, global models across multiple loads, or adaptive/personalized models for relatively small settings, and rarely addresses the combined challenges of heterogeneity and scalability in large feeders. We propose M2OE2-GL, a global-to-local extension of the M2OE2 probabilistic forecaster. We first pretrain a single global M2OE2 base model across all feeder loads, then apply lightweight fine-tuning to derive a compact family of group-specific forecasters. Evaluated on realistic utility data, M2OE2-GL yields substantial error reductions while remaining scalable to very large numbers of loads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faM2OE2 - GL\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u9988\u7ebf\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u9988\u7ebf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM2OE2 - GL\uff0c\u5148\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5168\u5c40M2OE2\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u518d\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u5f97\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u516c\u7528\u4e8b\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cM2OE2 - GL\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "M2OE2 - GL\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u9988\u7ebf\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u91cf\u8d1f\u8377\u3002"}}

We study uniform random sampling on the $d$-dimensional unit hypercube and analyze the number of uncovered subcubes after discretization. By applying a concentration inequality to the uncovered-count statistic, we derive a sample complexity bound with a logarithmic dependence on the failure probability ($\u03b4$), i.e., $M =O( \\tilde{C}\\ln(\\frac{2\\tilde{C}}\u03b4))$, which contrasts sharply with the classical linear $1/\u03b4$ dependence. Under standard Lipschitz and uniformity assumptions, we present a self-contained derivation and compare our result with classical coupon-collector rates. Numerical studies across dimensions, precision levels, and confidence targets indicate that our bound tracks practical coverage requirements more tightly and scales favorably as $\u03b4\\to 0$.

Hypercausal refers to AI systems that leverage extended, deep, or nonlinear causal relationships (expanded causality) to reason, predict, and infer states beyond the capabilities of traditional causal models. Current machine learning and quantum-inspired systems struggle in non-stationary environments, where data distributions drift and models lack mechanisms for continuous adaptation, causal stability, and coherent state updating. QML-HCS addresses this limitation through a unified computational architecture that integrates quantum-inspired superposition principles, dynamic causal feedback, and deterministic-stochastic hybrid execution to enable adaptive behavior in changing environments.\n  The framework implements a hypercausal processing core capable of reversible transformations, multipath causal propagation, and evaluation of alternative states under drift. Its architecture incorporates continuous feedback to preserve causal consistency and adjust model behavior without requiring full retraining. QML-HCS provides a reproducible and extensible Python interface backed by efficient computational routines, enabling experimentation in quantum-inspired learning, causal reasoning, and hybrid computation without the need for specialized hardware.\n  A minimal simulation demonstrates how a hypercausal model adapts to a sudden shift in the input distribution while preserving internal coherence.

However, existing methods typically require centralized data, which makes them unsuitable for distributed and federated environments where each device/client holds its own local dataset. Additionally, federated methods often assume that clients have labeled data, which is unrealistic in cases where clients lack the expertise or resources to label task-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose a Semi-Supervised Federated Multi-Label Feature Selection method, called SSFMLFS, where clients hold only unlabeled data, while the server has limited labeled data. SSFMLFS adapts fuzzy information theory to a federated setting, where clients compute fuzzy similarity matrices and transmit them to the server, which then calculates feature redundancy and feature-label relevancy degrees. A feature graph is constructed by modeling features as vertices, assigning relevancy and redundancy degrees as vertex weights and edge weights, respectively.

In addition, high training cost makes finetuning LLMs unaffordable with constrained computational resources, further undermining the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation. In this work, we propose SLMFix, a novel code generation pipeline that leverages a small language model (SLM) finetuned using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to fix syntactic errors in LLM-generated programs to improve the quality of LLM-generated programs for domain-specific languages (DSLs). In specific, we applied RL on the SLM for the program repair task using a reward calculated using both a static validator and a static semantic similarity metric. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across multiple DSLs, achieving more than 95% pass rate on the static validator.

To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Engineering, a lightweight method for enriching program semantics so that LLM-based systems can more accurately reflect developer intent without requiring full manual prompt design. We present Semantic Context Annotations (SemTexts), a language-level mechanism that allows developers to embed natural-language context directly into program constructs.

The cascaded architecture has emerged as the mainstream paradigm for deep learning-based precipitation nowcasting. This paradigm involves a deterministic model to predict macroscopic trends (or posterior mean), followed by a probabilistic model to generate local details (or local stochasticity). However, existing methods commonly overlook the conflation of the systematic distribution shift in deterministic predictions and the local stochasticity. As a result, the deterministic component's distribution shift contaminates the predictions of the probabilistic component, leading to inaccuracies in precipitation patterns and intensity, particularly over longer lead times. To address this issue, we introduce RectiCast, a two-stage framework that explicitly decouples the correction of mean-field shift from the generation of local stochasticity via a dual Flow Matching model. In the first stage, a deterministic model generates the posterior mean. In the second stage, we introduce a Rectifier to explicitly learn the distribution shift and produce a rectified mean. Subsequently, a Generator focuses on modeling the local stochasticity conditioned on the rectified mean.

AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform (AUTOSAR AP) is widely adopted in development to meet these criteria; however, licensing constraints and tool implementation challenges limit its use in research. Conversely, Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is predominantly used in research within the autonomous driving domain, leading to a disparity between research and development platforms that hinders swift commercialization. This paper proposes a collaboration framework that enables AUTOSAR AP and ROS 2 to communicate with each other using a Data Distribution Service for Real-Time Systems (DDS). In contrast, AUTOSAR AP uses Scalable service-Oriented Middleware over IP (SOME/IP) for communication. The proposed framework bridges these protocol differences, ensuring seamless interaction between the two platforms. We validate the functionality and performance of our bridge converter through empirical analysis, demonstrating its efficiency in conversion time and ease of integration with ROS 2 tools. Furthermore, the availability of the proposed collaboration framework is improved by automatically generating a configuration file for the proposed bridge converter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7fAUTOSAR AP\u548cROS 2\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7DDS\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e73\u53f0\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cAUTOSAR AP\u6709\u8bb8\u53ef\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0cROS 2\u591a\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u642d\u5efa\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528DDS\u8ba9AUTOSAR AP\u548cROS 2\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u534f\u8bae\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6865\u63a5\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8f6c\u6362\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6613\u4e0eROS 2\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper develops a structuralist decision framework for classifying the implicit ontological commitments made in machine learning research on neural network representations. Using a modified PRISMA protocol, a systematic review of the last two decades of literature on representation learning and interpretability is conducted. Five influential papers are analysed through three hierarchical criteria derived from structuralist philosophy of science: entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence. The results reveal a pronounced tendency toward structural idealism, where learned representations are treated as model-dependent constructions shaped by architec- ture, data priors, and training dynamics. Eliminative and non-eliminative structuralist stances appear selectively, while structural realism is notably absent. The proposed framework clarifies conceptual tensions in debates on interpretability, emergence, and epistemic trust in machine learning, and offers a rigorous foundation for future interdisciplinary work between philosophy of science and machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u4e49\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u627f\u8bfa\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e94\u7bc7\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u60f3\u4e3b\u4e49\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6f84\u6e05\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5f20\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8868\u5f81\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u54f2\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u627f\u8bfa\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684PRISMA\u534f\u8bae\u5bf9\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6587\u732e\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u4e49\u79d1\u5b66\u54f2\u5b66\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u6790\u4e94\u7bc7\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u60f3\u4e3b\u4e49\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4e60\u5f97\u8868\u5f81\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u7531\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5851\u9020\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u51fa\u73b0\u6d88\u9664\u6027\u548c\u975e\u6d88\u9664\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u4e49\u7acb\u573a\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e3b\u4e49\u660e\u663e\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6f84\u6e05\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6d8c\u73b0\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u4efb\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u54f2\u5b66\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u8c28\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, existing LLM serving frameworks exhibit non-deterministic behavior: identical inputs can yield different outputs when system configurations (e.g., tensor parallel (TP) size, batch size) vary, even under greedy decoding. This arises from the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic and inconsistent reduction orders across GPUs. While prior work has addressed batch-size-related nondeterminism through batch-invariant kernels, determinism across different TP sizes remains an open problem, particularly in RL settings, where the training engine typically uses Fully Sharded Data Parallel (i.e., TP = 1) while the rollout engine relies on multi-GPU TP to maximize the inference throughput, creating a natural mismatch between the two. This precision mismatch problem may lead to suboptimal performance or even collapse for RL training. We identify and analyze the root causes of TP-induced inconsistency and propose Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK), a set of TP-invariant matrix multiplication and reduction primitives that guarantee bit-wise identical results regardless of TP size. Our key insight is to align intra- and inter-GPU reduction orders through a unified hierarchical binary tree structure. We implement these kernels in Triton and integrate them into vLLM and FSDP.

We introduce MAGMA-Edu, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that unifies textual reasoning and diagrammatic synthesis for structured educational problem generation. Unlike existing methods that treat text and image generation independently, MAGMA-Edu employs a two-stage co-evolutionary pipeline: (1) a generation-verification-reflection loop that iteratively refines question statements and solutions for mathematical accuracy, and (2) a code-based intermediate representation that enforces geometric fidelity and semantic alignment during image rendering. Both stages are guided by internal self-reflection modules that evaluate and revise outputs until domain-specific pedagogical constraints are met. Extensive experiments on multimodal educational benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MAGMA-Edu over state-of-the-art MLLMs. Compared to GPT-4o, MAGMA-Edu improves the average textual metric from 57.01 to 92.31 (+35.3 pp) and boosts image-text consistency (ITC) from 13.20 to 85.24 (+72 pp). Across all model backbones, MAGMA-Edu achieves the highest scores (Avg-Text 96.20, ITC 99.12), establishing a new state of the art for multimodal educational content generation and demonstrating the effectiveness of self-reflective multi-agent collaboration in pedagogically aligned vision-language reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdMAGMA - Edu\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6559\u80b2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6559\u80b2\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6559\u5b66\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u751f\u6210 - \u9a8c\u8bc1 - \u53cd\u601d\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7531\u5185\u90e8\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u6a21\u5757\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6559\u80b2\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMAGMA - Edu\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6307\u6807\u548c\u56fe\u50cf - \u6587\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MAGMA - Edu\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6559\u80b2\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u6811\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u6746\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This especially holds for approaches that adapt to users and their specific states (e.g., motivation, knowledge, wants) over time.

In this work, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can be used out-of-the-box to generate samples of user interactions that provide useful information for training reinforcement learning models for digital behavior change settings. Using real user data from four large behavior change studies as comparison, we show that LLM-generated samples can be useful in the absence of real data. Comparisons to the samples provided by human raters further show that LLM-generated samples reach the performance of human raters. Additional analyses of different prompting strategies including shorter and longer prompt variants, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot prompting show that the relative effectiveness of different strategies depends on both the study and the LLM with also relatively large differences between prompt paraphrases alone.

In particular, we consider $k$-sparse Boolean functions that can be recursively decomposed into fixed 2-sparse Boolean functions. We analyze the learning dynamics of fine-tuning the transformer via either RL or SFT with CoT to identify sufficient conditions for it to provably learn these functions. We verify that these conditions hold for three basic examples, including $k$-PARITY, $k$-AND, and $k$-OR, thus demonstrating the learnability of both approaches.

Selecting reasonable external interfaces has thus become a crucial step in constructing LLM agents. In contrast to invoking API tools, directly calling AI models across different modalities from the community (e.g., HuggingFace) poses challenges due to the vast scale (> 10k), metadata gaps, and unstructured descriptions. Current methods for model selection often involve incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, wastage of tokens and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, a novel framework that combines Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, to efficiently select models. Specifically, We first perform multiple rounds of reasoning and retrieval to get a coarse list of candidate models. Then, we conduct fine-grained refinement by analyzing candidate model descriptions, followed by reflection to assess results and determine if retrieval scope expansion is necessary. This method reduces token consumption considerably by decoupling user query processing from complex model description handling.

To address these, we propose a novel Enhanced Federated Deep Multi-View Clustering framework: first align local semantics, hierarchical contrastive fusion within clients resolves view uncertainty by eliminating semantic conflicts; a view adaptive drift module mitigates aggregation uncertainty through global-local prototype contrast that dynamically corrects parameter deviations; and a balanced aggregation mechanism coordinates client updates.

To align the uncertainty measured by CP, conformal training methods minimize the size of the prediction sets. A typical way is to use a surrogate indicator function, usually Sigmoid or Gaussian error function. However, these surrogate functions do not have a uniform error bound to the indicator function, leading to uncontrollable learning bounds. In this paper, we propose a simple cost-sensitive conformal training algorithm that does not rely on the indicator approximation mechanism. Specifically, we theoretically show that minimizing the expected size of prediction sets is upper bounded by the expected rank of true labels. To this end, we develop a rank weighting strategy that assigns the weight using the rank of true label on each data sample. Our analysis provably demonstrates the tightness between the proposed weighted objective and the expected size of conformal prediction sets. Extensive experiments verify the validity of our theoretical insights, and superior empirical performance over other conformal training in terms of predictive efficiency with 21.38% reduction for average prediction set size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u6307\u6807\u8fd1\u4f3c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u5171\u5f62\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u9884\u671f\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5171\u5f62\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6307\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u65e0\u7edf\u4e00\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u754c\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6307\u6807\u8fd1\u4f3c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u5171\u5f62\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u52a0\u6743\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u9884\u671f\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c1121.38%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5171\u5f62\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications.

First, a dual-domain multi-prototype learner fuses temporal and frequency domain features, enhancing the model's generalization ability under signal distribution shifts. Second, a Statistical Guided Network (SGN) infers domain importance and prototype sensitivity from raw statistical features, providing data-driven prior information for learning in unlabeled or unseen domains.

However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches.

Knowledge distillation, transfer learning, and dataset distillation have made such transfers more efficient, yet they remain fundamentally data-driven: a teacher must produce examples, logits, or gradients for a student to learn. In this work, we introduce Model-to-Model Knowledge Transmission (M2KT), a novel paradigm for data-free conceptual transfer between neural networks. M2KT enables models to exchange knowledge packets that encapsulate structured concept embeddings, abstraction graphs, reasoning traces, and provenance metadata. Unlike classical distillation, M2KT operates primarily in concept space rather than example space, and it does not require labeled datasets or teacher-generated outputs during transfer. We formalize the notion of concept manifolds, introduce an inter-model alignment mapping between teacher and student latent spaces, and derive a composite loss that enforces geometric, structural, and reasoning consistency together with explicit safety constraints. We further present algorithmic procedures for teacher-side packet generation and student-side ingestion and verification. Experiments on symbolic reasoning with large language models show that M2KT can achieve approximately 85 to 90 percent of teacher performance while reducing data usage by over 98 percent compared to standard knowledge distillation.

The default strategy, sequential fine-tuning on each new phase, is architecture-agnostic but often suffers catastrophic forgetting when later phases correspond to different sub-populations or tasks. Replay with a finite buffer is a simple alternative, yet its behaviour across generative and predictive objectives is not well understood. We present a unified study of stateful replay for streaming autoencoding, time series forecasting, and classification. We view both sequential fine-tuning and replay as stochastic gradient methods for an ideal joint objective, and use a gradient alignment analysis to show when mixing current and historical samples should reduce forgetting. We then evaluate a single replay mechanism on six streaming scenarios built from Rotated MNIST, ElectricityLoadDiagrams 2011-2014, and Airlines delay data, using matched training budgets and three seeds. On heterogeneous multi task streams, replay reduces average forgetting by a factor of two to three, while on benign time based streams both methods perform similarly.

However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set.

But sustainable growth depends on acquired users' generating lifetime value (LTV) exceeding customer acquisition cost (CAC). In order to maximize LTV/CAC ratio, it is crucial to predict channel-level LTV in an early stage for further optimization of budget allocation. The LTV forecasting problem is significantly different from traditional time series forecasting problems, and there are three main challenges. Firstly, it is an unaligned multi-time series forecasting problem that each channel has a number of LTV series of different activation dates. Secondly, to predict in the early stage, it faces the imbalanced short-input long-output (SILO) challenge. Moreover, compared with the commonly used time series datasets, the real LTV series are volatile and non-stationary, with more frequent fluctuations and higher variance. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Trapezoidal Temporal Fusion (TTF) to address the above challenges. We introduce a trapezoidal multi-time series module to deal with data unalignment and SILO challenges, and output accurate predictions with a multi-tower structure called MT-FusionNet.

The structural causal bandit framework provides a graphical characterization for identifying actions that are unable to maximize rewards by leveraging prior knowledge of the underlying causal structure. While such knowledge enables an agent to estimate the expected rewards of certain actions based on others in online interactions, there has been little guidance on how to transfer information inferred from arbitrary combinations of datasets collected under different conditions -- observational or experimental -- and from heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we investigate the structural causal bandit with transportability, where priors from the source environments are fused to enhance learning in the deployment setting. We demonstrate that it is possible to exploit invariances across environments to consistently improve learning.

Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u7684UNeMo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u51b3\u7b56\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165UNeMo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08MWM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\uff08HPN\uff09\u673a\u5236\u4f7fMWM\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u7b56\u7565\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u53cc\u5411\u4fc3\u8fdb\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728R2R\u548cREVERIE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cUNeMo\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad82.1%\u548c0.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "UNeMo\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts.

By optimizing a residual-adjusted divergence, the DM approach recovers EM as a special case and yields robust alternatives through different divergence choices. We establish that the sample objective decreases monotonically along the iterates, leading the DM sequence to stationary points under standard conditions, and that at the population level the operator exhibits local contractivity near the minimizer. Additionally, we verify consistency and $\\sqrt{n}$-asymptotic normality of minimum-divergence estimators and of finitely many DM iterations, showing that under correct specification their limiting covariance matches the Fisher information. Robustness is analyzed via the residual-adjustment function, yielding bounded influence functions and a strictly positive breakdown bound for bounded-RAF divergences, and we contrast this with the non-robust behaviour of KL/EM. Next, we address the challenge of determining the number of mixture components by proposing a penalized divergence criterion combined with repeated sample splitting, which delivers consistent order selection and valid post-selection inference. Empirically, DM instantiations based on Hellinger and negative exponential divergences deliver accurate inference and remain stable under contamination in mixture and image-segmentation tasks.

This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks.

Although correlated noise, in particular via matrix factorizations, has been shown to improve accuracy, prior theoretical work focused primarily on the prefix-sum workload. That workload assumes a constant learning rate, whereas in practice learning rate schedules are widely used to accelerate training and improve convergence. We close this gap by deriving general upper and lower bounds for a broad class of learning rate schedules in both single- and multi-epoch settings. Building on these results, we propose a learning-rate-aware factorization that achieves improvements over prefix-sum factorizations under both MaxSE and MeanSE error metrics.

Together with the environmental indices, machine learning models were trained and the best-performing machine learning model (XGBoost) accuracy was RMSE of 1.38 kg/day for animal-level and only 0.14 kg/(day-animal) at pen-level.

Traditional methods, including linkage approaches, face three major limitations: (i) they always return a hierarchy, even if none exists, (ii) they are restricted to binary trees, even if the true hierarchy is non-binary, and (iii) they are highly sensitive to the choice of linkage function. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing the notion of a valid hierarchy and defining a partial order over the set of valid hierarchies. We prove the existence of a finest valid hierarchy, that is, the hierarchy that encodes the maximum information consistent with the similarity structure of the data set. In particular, the finest valid hierarchy is not constrained to binary structures and, when no hierarchical relationships exist, collapses to a star tree. We propose a simple two-step algorithm that first constructs a binary tree via a linkage method and then prunes it to enforce validity. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the linkage function under which this procedure exactly recovers the finest valid hierarchy, and we show that all linkage functions satisfying these conditions yield the same hierarchy after pruning. Notably, classical linkage rules such as single, complete, and average satisfy these conditions, whereas Ward's linkage fails to do so.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u6b65\u7b97\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u4f18\u6709\u6548\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u603b\u662f\u8fd4\u56de\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u9650\u4e8e\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u3001\u5bf9\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u654f\u611f\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u504f\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u4e8c\u53c9\u6811\u518d\u4fee\u526a\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6709\u6548\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u51fa\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u4fee\u526a\u540e\u5f97\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u94fe\u63a5\u89c4\u5219\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\uff0cWard\u94fe\u63a5\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u6548\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

However, integrating these sources into coherent spatial models for planning and prediction remains a major challenge. Existing agent-centric methods often rely on direct environmental sensing, limiting scalability and raising privacy concerns. This paper introduces CubeletWorld, a novel framework for representing and analyzing urban environments through a discretized 3D grid of spatial units called cubelets. This abstraction enables privacy-preserving modeling by embedding diverse data signals, such as infrastructure, movement, or environmental indicators, into localized cubelet states. CubeletWorld supports downstream tasks such as planning, navigation, and occupancy prediction without requiring agent-driven sensing. To evaluate this paradigm, we propose the CubeletWorld State Prediction task, which involves predicting the cubelet state using a realistic dataset containing various urban elements like streets and buildings through this discretized representation. We explore a range of modified core models suitable for our setting and analyze challenges posed by increasing spatial granularity, specifically the issue of sparsity in representation and scalability of baselines. In contrast to existing 3D occupancy prediction models, our cubelet-centric approach focuses on inferring state at the spatial unit level, enabling greater generalizability across regions and improved privacy compliance. Our results demonstrate that CubeletWorld offers a flexible and extensible framework for learning from complex urban data, and it opens up new possibilities for scalable simulation and decision support in domains such as socio-demographic modeling, environmental monitoring, and emergency response.

Surrogate models offer a more efficient alternative, but their development is hindered by the cost of generating sufficient training data from numerical solvers. In this paper, we present a novel framework for active learning (AL) in PDE surrogate modeling that reduces this cost. Unlike the existing AL methods for PDEs that always acquire entire PDE trajectories, our approach strategically generates only the most important time steps with the numerical solver, while employing the surrogate model to approximate the remaining steps. This dramatically reduces the cost incurred by each trajectory and thus allows the active learning algorithm to try out a more diverse set of trajectories given the same budget. To accommodate this novel framework, we develop an acquisition function that estimates the utility of a set of time steps by approximating its resulting variance reduction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers' equation, Korteweg-De Vries equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, and the compressible Navier-Stokes equation. Experiments show that our approach improves performance by large margins over the best existing method.

Profile-based SLU addresses ambiguous user utterances by incorporating context awareness (CA), user profiles (UP), and knowledge graphs (KG) to support disambiguation, thereby advancing SLU research toward real-world applicability. However, existing SLU datasets still fall short in representing real-world scenarios. Specifically, (1) CA uses one-hot vectors for representation, which is overly idealized, and (2) models typically focuses solely on predicting intents and slot labels, neglecting the reasoning process that could enhance performance and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VRSLU, a novel SLU dataset that integrates both Visual images and explicit Reasoning. For over-idealized CA, we use GPT-4o and FLUX.1-dev to generate images reflecting users' environments and statuses, followed by human verification to ensure quality. For reasoning, GPT-4o is employed to generate explanations for predicted labels, which are then refined by human annotators to ensure accuracy and coherence. Additionally, we propose an instructional template, LR-Instruct, which first predicts labels and then generates corresponding reasoning.

Batching is a primary concern in top-performing global routers, grouping nets into manageable sets to enable parallel processing and efficient resource usage. This process improves memory usage, scalable parallelization on modern hardware, and routing congestion by controlling net interactions within each batch. However, conventional batching methods typically depend on heuristics that are computationally expensive and can lead to suboptimal results (oversized batches with conflicting nets, excessive batch counts degrading parallelization, and longer batch generation times), ultimately limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these limitations, a novel batching algorithm enhanced with Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs) is introduced in this paper, enabling more effective parallelization by generating fewer higher-quality batches in less time. The proposed algorithm is tested on the latest ISPD'24 contest benchmarks, demonstrating up to 40% runtime reduction with only 0.002% degradation in routing quality as compared to state-of-the-art router.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528WGAN\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5728ISPD'24\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e14\u8def\u7531\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6279\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7528Wasserstein\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08WGANs\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728ISPD'24\u7ade\u8d5b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u8def\u7531\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1140%\uff0c\u8def\u7531\u8d28\u91cf\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d0.002%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u578b\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u66f4\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5c11\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6279\u6b21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002"}}

Existing techniques assume a finite input alphabet, and thus are not directly applicable to data sequences drawn from continuous domains.

Our main contribution is a framework for robust DRA extraction from black-box models: we develop a polynomial-time robustness checker for DRAs with a fixed number of registers, and combine it with passive and active automata learning algorithms. This combination yields surrogate DRAs with statistical robustness and equivalence guarantees. As a key application, we use the extracted automata to assess the robustness of neural networks: for a given sequence and distance metric, the DRA either certifies local robustness or produces a concrete counterexample. Experiments on recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures show that our framework reliably learns accurate automata and enables principled robustness evaluation.

This issue is gaining prominence in scientific debate due to recent technical advancements and increased media coverage. In parallel, AI progress has sparked speculation and studies about the potential emergence of artificial consciousness. The two questions, AI consciousness and existential risk, are sometimes conflated, as if the former entailed the latter. Here, I explain that this view stems from a common confusion between consciousness and intelligence. Yet these two properties are empirically and theoretically distinct. Arguably, while intelligence is a direct predictor of an AI system's existential threat, consciousness is not.

However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making.

However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models.\n  To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors.

Input transformation-based attacks are a subfield of adversarial attacks that enhance input diversity through input transformations to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, existing input transformation-based attacks tend to exhibit limited cross-model transferability. Previous studies have shown that high transferability is associated with diverse attention heatmaps and the preservation of global semantics in transformed inputs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Block Stretch and Shrink (BSS), a method that divides an image into blocks and applies stretch and shrink operations to these blocks, thereby diversifying attention heatmaps in transformed inputs while maintaining their global semantics. Empirical evaluations on a subset of ImageNet demonstrate that BSS outperforms existing input transformation-based attack methods in terms of transferability.

Barria"], "title": "Bayesian-based Online Label Shift Estimation with Dynamic Dirichlet Priors", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "comment": "13 pages, submitted to IEEE journal for possible publication", "summary": "Label shift, a prevalent challenge in supervised learning, arises when the class prior distribution of test data differs from that of training data, leading to significant degradation in classifier performance. To accurately estimate the test priors and enhance classification accuracy, we propose a Bayesian framework for label shift estimation, termed Full Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (FMAPLS), along with its online version, online-FMAPLS. Leveraging batch and online Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, these methods jointly and dynamically optimize Dirichlet hyperparameters $\\boldsymbol\u03b1$ and class priors $\\boldsymbol\u03c0$, thereby overcoming the rigid constraints of the existing Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (MAPLS) approach. Moreover, we introduce a linear surrogate function (LSF) to replace gradient-based hyperparameter updates, yielding closed-form solutions that reduce computational complexity while retaining asymptotic equivalence. The online variant substitutes the batch E-step with a stochastic approximation, enabling real-time adaptation to streaming data. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between online convergence rate and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets under shuffled long-tail and Dirichlet test priors demonstrate that FMAPLS and online-FMAPLS respectively achieve up to 40% and 12% lower KL divergence and substantial improvements in post-shift accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance and distributional uncertainty.

In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

Best-of-N (BoN) selects the output with the highest reward, and with perfect rewards, it often achieves near-perfect accuracy. With imperfect rewards from reward models, however, BoN fails to reliably find the correct answer and its performance degrades drastically. We consider the distribution of BoN's outputs and highlight that, although the correct answer does not usually have a probability close to one under imperfect rewards, it is often the most likely outcome. This suggests that the mode of this distribution can be more reliably correct than a sample from it. Based on this idea, we propose Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a novel selection mechanism that estimates the output distribution of BoN via bootstrapping and selects its mode. Experimental results across five benchmarks, three different base LLMs, and two reward models demonstrate consistent improvements over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups.

This paper introduces a periodicity-enforced surrogate modeling approach that incorporates periodic layers, neural network components that guarantee exact periodicity without penalty terms or output modifications, into deep learning architectures for DLD device design. The proposed method employs three sub-networks to predict steady-state, non-dimensional velocity and pressure fields (u, v, p) rather than directly predicting critical diameters or particle trajectories, enabling complete flow field characterization and enhanced design flexibility. Periodic layers ensure exact matching of flow variables across unit cell boundaries through architectural enforcement rather than soft penalty-based approaches. Validation on 120 CFD-generated geometries demonstrates that the periodic layer implementation achieves 0.478% critical diameter error while maintaining perfect periodicity consistency, representing an 85.4% improvement over baseline methods.

Corrective Machine Unlearning (CMU) seeks to remove the influence of such corruption post-training. Prior CMU typically assumes access to identified corrupted training samples (a ``forget set''). However, in many real-world scenarios the training data are no longer accessible. We formalize \\emph{source-free} CMU, where the original training data are unavailable and, consequently, no forget set of identified corrupted training samples can be specified. Instead, we assume a small proxy (surrogate) set of corrupted samples that reflect the suspected corruption type without needing to be the original training samples. In this stricter setting, methods relying on forget set are ineffective or narrow in scope. We introduce \\textit{Corrective Unlearning in Task Space} (CUTS), a lightweight weight space correction method guided by the proxy set using task arithmetic principles. CUTS treats the clean and the corruption signal as distinct tasks. Specifically, we briefly fine-tune the corrupted model on the proxy to amplify the corruption mechanism in the weight space, compute the difference between the corrupted and fine-tuned weights as a proxy task vector, and subtract a calibrated multiple of this vector to cancel the corruption. Without access to clean data or a forget set, CUTS recovers a large fraction of the lost utility under label noise and, for backdoor triggers, nearly eliminates the attack with minimal damage to utility, outperforming state-of-the-art specialized CMU methods in source-free setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u7ea0\u6b63\u6027\u673a\u5668\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecdCUTS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea0\u6b63\u6027\u673a\u5668\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u635f\u574f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CUTS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u96c6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u672f\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u5c06\u5e72\u51c0\u548c\u635f\u574f\u4fe1\u53f7\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u51e0\u4e4e\u6d88\u9664\u653b\u51fb\u4e14\u5bf9\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5bb3\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CUTS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u7ea0\u6b63\u6027\u673a\u5668\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Large language models (LLMs) provide strategic reasoning for 6G planning, but their computational cost and latency limit real-time use. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) supports localized adaptation, yet coordination at scale remains challenging. We present AURA, a framework that integrates cloud-based LLMs for high-level planning with base stations modeled as MARL agents for local decision-making. The LLM generates objectives and subgoals from its understanding of the environment and reasoning capabilities, while agents at base stations execute these objectives autonomously, guided by a trust mechanism that balances local learning with external input. To reduce latency, AURA employs batched communication so that agents update the LLM's view of the environment and receive improved feedback. In a simulated 6G scenario, AURA improves resilience, reducing dropped handoff requests by more than half under normal and high traffic and lowering system failures. Agents use LLM input in fewer than 60\\% of cases, showing that guidance augments rather than replaces local adaptability, thereby mitigating latency and hallucination risks. These results highlight the promise of combining LLM reasoning with MARL adaptability for scalable, real-time NextG network management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAURA\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u5f39\u6027\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e22\u5f03\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u8702\u7a9d\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u7ba1\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u6d41\u91cf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u534f\u8c03\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAURA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e91\u7aef\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u57fa\u7ad9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u5730\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6279\u91cf\u901a\u4fe1\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df6G\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cAURA\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u6b63\u5e38\u548c\u9ad8\u6d41\u91cf\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u4e00\u534a\u5207\u6362\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e22\u5f03\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c11\u4e8e60%\u60c5\u51b5\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u6709\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

To overcome the challenges of rare CTC detection and reduce reliance on computationally intensive simulations, machine learning models including gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressors are employed. Trained on a large, numerically validated dataset, these models predict particle trajectories and identify optimal device configurations, enabling high-throughput and cost-effective DLD design.

Although existing methods address this issue by adjusting logits based on the estimated class distribution of unlabeled data, they often handle model imbalance in a coarse-grained manner, conflating data imbalance with bias arising from varying class-specific learning difficulties. To address this issue, we propose a unified framework, SC-SSL, which suppresses model bias through decoupled sampling control. During training, we identify the key variables for sampling control under ideal conditions. By introducing a classifier with explicit expansion capability and adaptively adjusting sampling probabilities across different data distributions, SC-SSL mitigates feature-level imbalance for minority classes. In the inference phase, we further analyze the weight imbalance of the linear classifier and apply post-hoc sampling control with an optimization bias vector to directly calibrate the logits.

These use cases are often delivered via non-public networks (NPNs) or dedicated network slices, where reliability and safety are vital. In this paper, we motivate the need for transparent and trustworthy AI in high-stakes communications (e.g., healthcare, industrial automation, and robotics) by drawing on 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP)'s vision for non-public networks. We design a mathematical framework to model the trade-offs between transparency (explanation fidelity and fairness), latency, and graphics processing unit (GPU) utilization in deploying explainable AI (XAI) models. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid XAI model xAI-Native, consistently surpasses conventional baseline models in performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u539f\u751f\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u4e2d\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faxAI - Native\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee35G/6G\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528AI\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f46AI\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u6709\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u901a\u4fe1\u573a\u666f\u9700\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u92743GPP\u975e\u516c\u5171\u7f51\u7edc\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408XAI\u6a21\u578bxAI - Native\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684xAI - Native\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2dAI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u6210\u6548\u3002"}}

Our contribution is an efficient refitting procedure that computes the excess risk and provides high-probability upper bounds under the fixed-design setting. Assuming only black-box access to the training algorithm and a single dataset, we begin by generating two sets of artificially modified pseudo-outcomes termed wild response, created by stochastically perturbing the gradient vectors with carefully chosen scaling. Using these two pseudo-labeled datasets, we then refit the black-box procedure twice to obtain two corresponding wild predictors. Finally, leveraging the original predictor, the two wild predictors, and the constructed wild responses, we derive an efficient excess risk upper bound. A key feature of our analysis is that it requires no prior knowledge of the complexity of the underlying function class.

Implementation with 18 student groups across four Australian universities revealed how orchestration skills develop. Most groups (84\\%) moved beyond passive acceptance, showing selective judgment, yet none proactively identified gaps overlooked by both human and AI analysis, indicating a competency ceiling. Students strong at explaining decisions also performed well at integrating sources, and those with deep domain understanding consistently considered accessibility considerations.

Notably, 55\\% of groups struggled identifying when AI misclassified system boundaries (what belongs inside versus outside the system), 45\\% missed data management errors (how information is stored and updated), and 55\\% overlooked missing exception handling. Three implications emerge for educators: (i) require students to document why they accepted, modified, or rejected each AI suggestion, making reasoning explicit; (ii) embed accessibility prompts at each development stage because awareness collapses without continuous scaffolding; and (iii) have students create their own specifications before using AI, then compare versions, and anchor to research or standards to identify gaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b66\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u7f16\u6392\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cSAGE\u5d4c\u5165GenAI\u5230\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u663e\u793a\u5b66\u751f\u7f16\u6392\u6280\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u6709\u4e09\u70b9\u542f\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b66\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6559\u5bfc\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u5b58\u5728\u76f2\u76ee\u63a5\u53d7AI\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5c06GenAI\u5d4c\u5165\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f62\u6210SAGE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56db\u6240\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u5927\u5b66\u768418\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u5c0f\u7ec4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570\u5c0f\u7ec4\u8d85\u8d8a\u88ab\u52a8\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u7f16\u6392\u6280\u80fd\u6709\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u5982\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u529b\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u8bc6\u522bAI\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u5e94\u8981\u6c42\u5b66\u751f\u8bb0\u5f55\u51b3\u7b56\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8ba9\u5b66\u751f\u5148\u81ea\u884c\u521b\u5efa\u89c4\u8303\u518d\u4e0eAI\u751f\u6210\u7248\u672c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002"}}

It also facilitates closed loop control and (non/near) real-time optimization of radio access network (RAN) through the integration of non-real-time applications (rApps) and near-real-time applications (xApps). However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN that can severely undermine network performance and subject it to a prominent threat to the security & reliability of O-RAN networks is jamming attacks. To address this, we introduce SAJD-a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects jamming attacks in artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML)-integrated O-RAN environments. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes near-real-time inference of radio signal jamming interference via our developed ML-based xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps. Specifically, a labeler rApp is developed that uses live telemetry (i.e., KPIs) to detect model drift, triggers unsupervised data labeling, executes model training/retraining using the integrated & open-source ClearML framework, and updates deployed models on the fly, without service disruption. Experiments on O-RAN-compliant testbed demonstrate that the SAJD framework outperforms state-of-the-art (offline-trained with manual labels) jamming detection approach in accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen interference scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdSAJD\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4bAI/ML\u96c6\u6210\u7684O - RAN\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "O - RAN\u7f51\u7edc\u9762\u4e34\u5e72\u6270\u653b\u51fb\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SAJD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684xApp\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u65ad\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u901a\u8fc7rApp\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1labeler rApp\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u89e6\u53d1\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3/\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b26\u5408O - RAN\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cSAJD\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u5e72\u6270\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SAJD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4bO - RAN\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges with minimal overhead. While existing PTQ methods can effectively quantize LLMs, they experience substantial accuracy loss at extremely low bit-widths, primarily due to high-impact parameters that significantly influence quantization performance. Several approaches address these issues by identifying and retaining the high-impact parameters in FP16 format. However, they apply fixed ratios of high-impact parameters across all layers, overlooking layer-wise sensitivity variations. In this paper, we propose a quadratic optimization framework that determines layer-specific ratios of high-impact parameters while considering inter-layer dependencies. We quantize high-impact parameters to moderate bit-widths, which often result in negligible performance degradation in quantized LLMs, while the remaining parameters can be quantized to extremely low bit-widths. Under the same resource-constrained budget, this allows for preserving more high-impact parameters than methods that keep selecting a few in FP16 format. Additionally, the proposed framework allows us to leverage an advanced quantization method that often requires extensive learnable parameters solely for high-impact parameters, while applying a computationally efficient method to the rest. Our approach achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy while maintaining high performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u4f4d\u5bbd\u6709\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u5b9a\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u4f4d\u5bbd\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u56fa\u5b9a\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5ffd\u7565\u5c42\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u5b9a\u5c42\u7279\u5b9a\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u5230\u9002\u5ea6\u4f4d\u5bbd\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u91cf\u5316\u5230\u6781\u4f4e\u4f4d\u5bbd\uff1b\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8d44\u6e90\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u53ea\u4fdd\u7559\u5c11\u91cfFP16\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u591a\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a model of safe farming in which the crops will be protected from vertebrates attack through a prevention system that is based on Wirelesses Sensors Networks. Different sensor nodes are placed around the field that detect animals or birds existence and generate required signals and information. This information is passed to the Repelling and Notifying System (RNS) that is installed at the field through a short range wireless technology, ZigBee. As RNS receives the information, it generates ultrasonic sounds that are unbearable for animals and birds, which causes them to run away from the field. These ultrasonic sounds are generated in a frequency range that only animals and birds can hear, while humans cannot notice the sound. The paper also proposes a notifying system. It will inform the farmer about animals or birds intrusion in the field through SMS, but doesn't need any action from the farmer.

However, the main obstacle to effective quantization lies in systematic outliers in activations and weights, which cause substantial LLM performance degradation, especially at low-bit settings. While existing transformation-based methods like affine and rotation transformations successfully mitigate outliers, they apply the homogeneous transformation setting, i.e., using the same transformation types across all layers, ignoring the heterogeneous distribution characteristics within LLMs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive transformation selection framework that systematically determines optimal transformations on a per-layer basis. To this end, we first formulate transformation selection as a differentiable optimization problem to achieve the accurate transformation type for each layer. However, searching for optimal layer-wise transformations for every model is computationally expensive. To this end, we establish the connection between weight distribution kurtosis and accurate transformation type. Specifically, we propose an outlier-guided layer selection method using robust $z$-score normalization that achieves comparable performance to differentiable search with significantly reduced overhead. Comprehensive experiments on LLaMA family models demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently outperforms the widely-used fixed transformation settings. For example, our method achieves an improvement of up to 4.58 perplexity points and a 2.11% gain in average six-task zero-shot accuracy under aggressive W3A3K2V2 quantization settings for the LLaMA-3-8B model compared to the current best existing method, FlatQuant, demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous transformation selection for optimal LLM quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u6362\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u53d8\u6362\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u540c\u8d28\u53d8\u6362\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53d8\u6362\u9009\u62e9\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u5cf0\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u53d8\u6362\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2z - \u5206\u6570\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaMA\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u53d8\u6362\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5982\u5728LLaMA - 3 - 8B\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6fc0\u8fdb\u91cf\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u53474.58\u70b9\uff0c\u516d\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad82.11%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u6784\u53d8\u6362\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u91cf\u5316\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002"}}

However, existing deep learning-based methods for RM construction often model dynamic environments as a series of independent static snapshots, thereby omitting the temporal continuity inherent in signal propagation changes caused by the motion of dynamic entities. To address this limitation, we propose the task of spatio-temporal RM prediction, which involves forecasting a sequence of future maps from historical observations. A key barrier to this predictive approach has been the lack of datasets capturing continuous environmental evolution. To fill this gap, we introduce RadioMapMotion, the first large-scale public dataset of continuous RM sequences generated from physically consistent vehicle trajectories. As a baseline for this task, we propose RadioLSTM, a UNet architecture based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) and designed for multi-step sequence forecasting. Experimental evaluations show that RadioLSTM achieves higher prediction accuracy and structural fidelity compared to representative baseline methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits a low inference latency, indicating its potential suitability for real-time network operations.

As such, OPE plays a critical role in ensuring safety in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, standard OPE approaches are limited by the size and coverage of the behavior dataset. While previous work has explored using expert-labeled counterfactual annotations to enhance dataset coverage, obtaining such annotations is expensive, limiting the scalability of prior approaches. We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual annotations for OPE in medical domains. Our method uses domain knowledge to guide LLMs in predicting how key clinical features evolve under alternate treatments. These predicted features can then be transformed using known reward functions to create counterfactual annotations. We first evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict clinical features across two patient subsets in MIMIC-IV, finding that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve comparable performance. Building on this capacity to predict clinical features, we generate LLM-based counterfactual annotations and incorporate them into an OPE estimator. Our empirical results analyze the benefits of counterfactual annotations under varying degrees of shift between the behavior and target policies. We find that in most cases, the LLM-based counterfactual annotations significantly improve OPE estimates up to a point. We provide an entropy-based metric to identify when additional annotations cease to be useful.

It is known that MDMs effectively train to decode tokens in a random order, and that this ordering has significant performance implications in practice. This observation raises a fundamental question: can we design a training framework that optimizes for a favorable decoding order? We answer this in the affirmative, showing that the continuous-time variational objective of MDMs, when equipped with multivariate noise schedules, can identify and optimize for a decoding order during training. We establish a direct correspondence between decoding order and the multivariate noise schedule and show that this setting breaks invariance of the MDM objective to the noise schedule.

This paper evaluates the application of Device-First Continuum AI (DFC-AI) to critical energy sector operations. DFC-AI, a specialized architecture within the Hybrid Edge Cloud paradigm, implements intelligent agents using a microservices architecture that originates at end devices and extends across the computational continuum. Through comprehensive simulations of energy sector scenarios including drone inspections, sensor networks, and worker safety systems, we demonstrate that DFC-AI maintains full operational capability during network outages while cloud and gateway-based systems experience complete or partial failure. Our analysis reveals that zero-configuration GPU discovery and heterogeneous device clustering are particularly well-suited for energy sector deployments, where specialized nodes can handle intensive AI workloads for entire fleets of inspection drones or sensor networks. The evaluation shows that DFC-AI achieves significant latency reduction and energy savings compared to cloud architectures. Additionally, we find that gateway based edge solutions can paradoxically cost more than cloud solutions for certain energy sector workloads due to infrastructure overhead, while DFC-AI can consistently provide cost savings by leveraging enterprise-owned devices. These findings, validated through rigorous statistical analysis, establish that DFC-AI addresses the unique challenges of energy sector operations, ensuring intelligent agents remain available and functional in remote oil fields, offshore platforms, and other challenging environments characteristic of the industry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86Device - First Continuum AI (DFC - AI) \u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5173\u952e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u65ad\u65f6\u4ecd\u6709\u5b8c\u6574\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e91\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u8282\u7701\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u80fd\u6e90\u884c\u4e1a\u5de5\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u4ee5\u4e91\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8bc4\u4f30DFC - AI\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5de5\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "DFC - AI\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u65ad\u65f6\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u6574\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u6216\u7f51\u5173\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u5b8c\u5168\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u8282\u7701\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e9b\u80fd\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u5173\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e91\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u800cDFC - AI\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u4f01\u4e1a\u81ea\u6709\u8bbe\u5907\u8282\u7701\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "DFC - AI\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u6e90\u884c\u4e1a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u504f\u8fdc\u6cb9\u7530\u3001\u6d77\u4e0a\u5e73\u53f0\u7b49\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u4e14\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u5e38\u3002"}}

ZoomDiff maps the urban environmental context into network traffic with multiple spatiotemporal resolutions through custom-designed Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models (DRDM).

It aligns the progressive denoising process of diffusion models with hierarchical network layers, including BSs, cells, and grids with different granularities. Evaluations on real-world mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ZoomDiff achieves a performance improvement of at least 18.4% over state-of-the-art baselines on generation tasks at multi-scale traffic.

However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u957f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u957f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f53\u4e0b\u9644\u8fd1\u65f6\u95f4\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u3001\u8fdc\u5904\u8f83\u7c97\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6eda\u52a8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u957f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional fault detection methods often struggle to effectively balance accuracy and energy consumption, and they may not fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal correlations inherent in WSN data. In this paper, we introduce HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical fault identification framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage process. Firstly, edge classifiers with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) stacked autoencoder perform temporal feature extraction and output initial fault class prediction for individual sensor nodes. Using these results, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) then aggregates information from neighboring nodes to refine the classification by integrating the topology context. Our method is able to produce more accurate predictions by capturing both local temporal patterns and network-wide spatial dependencies. To validate this approach, we constructed synthetic WSN datasets by introducing specific, predefined faults into the Intel Lab Dataset and NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis data. Experimental results demonstrate that HiFiNet significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy, F1-score, and precision, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in identifying diverse fault types.

However, its long-term reliability is hindered by hardware/software variations across mobile devices, which shift the model's input distribution to create domain shifts. Further, evolving indoor environments can introduce new locations over time, expanding the output space to create class shifts, making static machine learning models ineffective over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unified continual learning framework for indoor localization called MOELO that, for the first time, jointly addresses domain-incremental and class-incremental learning scenarios. MOELO enables a lightweight, robust, and adaptive localization solution that can be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices and is capable of continual learning in dynamic, heterogeneous real-world settings. This is made possible by a mixture-of-experts architecture, where experts are incrementally trained per region and selected through an equiangular tight frame based gating mechanism ensuring efficient routing, and low-latency inference, all within a compact model footprint. Experimental evaluations show that MOELO achieves improvements of up to 25.6x in mean localization error, 44.5x in worst-case localization error, and 21.5x lesser forgetting compared to state-of-the-art frameworks across diverse buildings, mobile devices, and learning scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6MOELO\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u57df\u589e\u91cf\u548c\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u8bbe\u5907\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMOELO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6309\u533a\u57df\u9010\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b49\u89d2\u7d27\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "MOELO\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5efa\u7b51\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u591a\u6539\u558425.6\u500d\uff0c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u591a\u6539\u558444.5\u500d\uff0c\u9057\u5fd8\u7387\u964d\u4f4e21.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "MOELO\u80fd\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u3002"}}

We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone.

Extending such models to brain signals could deepen our understanding of human perception and mental representations. However,electroencephalography (EEG) presents major challenges for image generation due to high noise, low spatial resolution, and strong inter-subject variability. Existing approaches,such as DreamDiffusion, BrainVis, and GWIT, primarily adapt EEG features to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models using complex alignment or classification pipelines, often resulting in large parameter counts and limited interpretability. We introduce SYNAPSE, a two-stage framework that bridges EEG signal representation learning and high-fidelity image synthesis. In Stage1, a CLIP-aligned EEG autoencoder learns a semantically structured latent representation by combining signal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. In Stage2, the pretrained encoder is frozen and integrated with a lightweight adaptation of Stable Diffusion, enabling efficient conditioning on EEG features with minimal trainable parameters. Our method achieves a semantically coherent latent space and state-of-the-art perceptual fidelity on the CVPR40 dataset, outperforming prior EEG-to-image models in both reconstruction efficiency and image quality. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that SYNAPSE generalizes effectively across subjects, preserving visual semantics even when class-level agreement is reduced.

A self-supervised \\emph{graded utility functional}, defined as the loss reduction induced by a candidate morphism, governs activation and yields sparse, interpretable behavior. We develop the algebraic and geometric foundations: an internal model category whose objects are homogeneous components and whose morphisms are admissible grade transitions; adjoint pairs encoding typed round trips; and information-geometric interpretations in terms of KL gain, mirror descent with Bregman divergences, and Fisher natural gradients.

However, accurate modeling of realistic grain boundary networks requires large simulation cells, which GNN has difficulty scaling up to. To alleviate the computational costs and memory footprint of GNN, we propose a hybrid architecture combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) based bijective autoencoder to compress the spatial dimensions, and a GNN that evolves the microstructure in the latent space of reduced spatial sizes. Our results demonstrate that the new design significantly reduces computational costs with using fewer message passing layer (from 12 down to 3) compared with GNN alone. The reduction in computational cost becomes more pronounced as the spatial size increases, indicating strong computational scalability. For the largest mesh evaluated (160^3), our method reduces memory usage and runtime in inference by 117x and 115x, respectively, compared with GNN-only baseline. More importantly, it shows higher accuracy and stronger spatiotemporal capability than the GNN-only baseline, especially in long-term testing. Such combination of scalability and accuracy is essential for simulating realistic material microstructures over extended time scales. The improvements can be attributed to the bijective autoencoder's ability to compress information losslessly from spatial domain into a high dimensional feature space, thereby producing more expressive latent features for the GNN to learn from, while also contributing its own spatiotemporal modeling capability. The training was optimized to learn from the stochastic Potts Monte Carlo method.

Existing methods predominantly rely on overly simplistic spatial-domain architectures constructed from a single data source, limiting their ability to accurately capture complex precipitation patterns and sharply defined meteorological boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose WaveC2R, a novel wavelet-driven coarse-to-refined framework for radar retrieval. WaveC2R integrates complementary multi-source data and leverages frequency-domain decomposition to separately model low-frequency components for capturing precipitation patterns and high-frequency components for delineating sharply defined meteorological boundaries. Specifically, WaveC2R consists of two stages (i)Intensity-Boundary Decoupled Learning, which leverages wavelet decomposition and frequency-specific loss functions to separately optimize low-frequency intensity and high-frequency boundaries; and (ii)Detail-Enhanced Diffusion Refinement, which employs frequency-aware conditional priors and multi-source data to progressively enhance fine-scale precipitation structures while preserving coarse-scale meteorological consistency.

This work extends that foundational theory to the diverse architectures of modern Large Language Models. We first demonstrate a precise, analytical solution for a Gemma-style transformer block, proving that the entire effect of a context can be perfectly mapped to rank-1 patches on its MLP weight matrices and a patch to the RMSNorm scale. We then generalize this result, providing a constructive proof and algorithm for multi-layer models. To unify these findings, we introduce a general framework centered on two core properties: input controllability and output controllability.

In contrast, live jamming is a collaborative interaction that requires real-time coordination and adaptation without access to the other player's future moves, while preserving diversity to sustain a creative flow. Reinforcement learning post-training enables effective adaptation through on-policy interaction, yet it often reduces output diversity by exploiting coherence-based rewards. This collapse, known as ``reward hacking'', affects many RL post-training pipelines, but is especially harmful in live jamming, where musical creativity relies on dynamic variation and mutual responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training method on policy-generated trajectories to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for melody-to-chord accompaniment. A co-evolving discriminator separates policy trajectories from the data distribution, while the policy maximizes the discriminator output in addition to coherence rewards to prevent collapse to trivial outputs. We evaluate accompaniment quality and output diversity in simulation with both fixed test melodies and learned melody agents, and we conduct a user study with the model deployed in a real-time interactive system with expert musicians. Quantitative evaluation and user feedback demonstrate improved output diversity, harmonic coherence, adaptation speed and user agency.

In use cases like repeatable workflows and agentic settings, prompts are often reused with minor variations while having a similar structure for recurring tasks. This opens up opportunities for caching. However, exact prompt matching fails on such structurally similar prompts, while semantic caching may produce incorrect responses by ignoring critical differences. To address this, we introduce \\ourmethod{}, a generative cache that produces variation-aware responses for structurally similar prompts. \\ourmethod{} identifies reusable response patterns across similar prompt structures and synthesizes customized outputs for new requests. We show that \\ourmethod{} achieves 83\\% cache hit rate, while having minimal incorrect hits on datasets without prompt repetition.

We introduce and validate the Influence Score, a controllability-based metric derived from the discretized state-space parameters of Mamba and computed through a backward recurrence analogous to system observability. The score quantifies how strongly a token at position k affects all later states and outputs. We evaluate this measure across three Mamba variants: mamba-130m, mamba-2.8b, and mamba-2.8b-slimpj, using six experiments that test its sensitivity to temperature, prompt complexity, token type, layer depth, token position, and input perturbations. The results show three main insights: (1) the Influence Score increases with model size and training data, reflecting model capacity; (2) Mamba exhibits consistent architectural patterns, including recency bias and concentrated influence in mid-to-late layers; and (3) emergent behaviors appear only at scale, with mamba-2.8b-slimpj uniquely prioritizing content words and reducing internal influence in the presence of noise.

Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel anomaly-resilient federated learning framework that simultaneously preserves data privacy, detects cyber-attacks, and maintains trustworthy demand prediction accuracy under adversarial conditions. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: LSTM autoencoder-based distributed anomaly detection deployed at each federated client, interpolation-based anomalous data mitigation to preserve temporal continuity, and federated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that enable collaborative learning without centralized data aggregation. The framework is validated on real-world EV charging infrastructure datasets combined with real-world DDoS attack datasets, providing robust validation of the proposed approach under realistic threat scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the federated approach achieves superior performance compared to centralized models, with 15.2% improvement in R2 accuracy while maintaining data locality. The integrated cyber-attack detection and mitigation system produces trustworthy datasets that enhance prediction reliability, recovering 47.9% of attack-induced performance degradation while maintaining exceptional precision (91.3%) and minimal false positive rates (1.21%).

News recommender systems (NRSs) have shown to be useful in this process, minimizing political disengagement and information overload by providing individuals with articles on topics that matter to them. Unfortunately, NRSs often conflate underlying user interest with the partisan bias of the articles in their reading history and with the most popular biases present in the coverage of their favored topics. Over extended interaction, this can result in the formation of filter bubbles and the polarization of user partisanship. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding space called Constructed Political Coordinates (CPC), which models the political partisanship of users over a given topic-space, relative to a larger sample population. We apply a simple collaborative filtering (CF) framework using CPC-based correlation to recommend articles sourced from oppositional users, who have different biases from the user in question. We compare against classical CF methods and find that CPC-based methods promote pointed bias diversity and better match the true political tolerance of users, while classical methods implicitly exploit biases to maximize interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08NRSs\uff09\u867d\u6709\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u548c\u7528\u6237\u515a\u6d3e\u504f\u89c1\u6781\u5316\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCPC\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eCPC\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u8350\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u504f\u89c1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3NRSs\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u548c\u7528\u6237\u515a\u6d3e\u504f\u89c1\u6781\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConstructed Political Coordinates (CPC) \u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eCPC\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u8350\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u89c1\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178CF\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "CPC-based\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u653f\u6cbb\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u504f\u89c1\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "CPC-based\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Because no public datasets exist for computer-vision-based body fat estimation, this dataset was compiled specifically for this study. Two approaches were developed: (1) ResNet-based image models and (2) regression models using anthropometric measurements. A multimodal fusion framework is also outlined for future expansion once paired datasets become available. The image-based model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.44% and a Coefficient of Determination (R^2) of 0.807.

Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising solution, using simple arithmetic operations-addition and negation-based on task vectors which are the differences between fine-tuned and pre-trained model weights, to efficiently modify model behavior. However, the full potential of task arithmetic remains underexplored, primarily due to limited mechanisms for overcoming optimization stagnation. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of difference vector, a generalized form of task vectors derived from the historical movements during optimization. Using difference vectors as directed perturbations, we propose the Difference Vector-based Anisotropic Scaling Iterative algorithm (DV-BASI) to enable a continuous optimization process for task arithmetic methods without relying on any additional modules or components. Notably, by leveraging escapability and directional advantages of difference vectors, the average performance on different tasks of the multi-task model merged by DV-BASI may even outperform models individually fine-tuned. Based on this observation, we extend the application of difference vectors to a feasible fine-tuning method for single-task models. On the practical side, DV-BASI allows expressive searching directions with few learnable parameters and forms a scalable framework. We also integrate DV-BASI with task arithmetic methods and advanced optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both supervised and unsupervised evaluation protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6709\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u63d0\u51faDV - BASI\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u672f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6709\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u56e0\u4f18\u5316\u505c\u6ede\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDV - BASI\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u672f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c06\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u672f\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u7ecfDV - BASI\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u8d85\u5355\u72ec\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0a\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "DV - BASI\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning.

Unlike traditional agent-based models that rely on fixed behavioral rules, our platform enables rigorous evaluation of how reward function design affects learned survival strategies across diverse epidemic scenarios. ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable environmental parameters, allowing researchers to stress-test reward functions under varying conditions including limited observability, different movement patterns, and heterogeneous population dynamics. We evaluate five distinct reward designs, ranging from sparse survival bonuses to a novel potential field approach, across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C). Through systematic ablation studies, we identify that directional guidance and explicit adherence incentives are critical components for robust policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation across varying infection rates, grid sizes, visibility constraints, and movement patterns reveals that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes.

This paper presents the first theoretical framework to analyze private training through a feature learning perspective. Building on the multi-patch data structure from prior work, our analysis distinguishes between label-dependent feature signals and label-independent noise, a critical aspect overlooked by existing analyses in the DP community. Employing a two-layer CNN with polynomial ReLU activation, we theoretically characterize both feature signal learning and data noise memorization in private training via noisy gradient descent. Our findings reveal that (1) Effective private signal learning requires a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to non-private training, and (2) When data noise memorization occurs in non-private learning, it will also occur in private learning, leading to poor generalization despite small training loss.

In this work, we uncover a notable property: fine-tuned models preserve the geometric structure of their loss landscapes concerning harmful content, regardless of the fine-tuning method employed. This suggests that safety behaviors are not erased but shifted to less influential regions of the parameter space. Building on this insight, we propose a curvature-aware alignment restoration method that leverages influence functions and second-order optimization to selectively increase loss on harmful inputs while preserving task performance. By navigating the shared geometry between base and fine-tuned models, our method discourages unsafe outputs while preserving task-relevant performance, avoiding full reversion and enabling precise, low-impact updates.

This article introduces a three-tier architecture, the Hierarchical Adaptive Consensus Network (\\hacn), which suggests various consensus policies based on task characterization and agent performance metrics. The first layer collects the confidence-based voting outcomes of several local agent clusters. In contrast, the second level facilitates inter-cluster communication through cross-clustered partial knowledge sharing and dynamic timeouts. The third layer provides system-wide coordination and final arbitration by employing a global orchestration framework with adaptable decision rules. The proposed model achieves $\\bigO(n)$ communication complexity, as opposed to the $\\bigO(n^2)$ complexity of the existing fully connected MAS.

Class Imbalance (CI) remains a fundamental challenge in FL, where rare but critical classes are often severely underrepresented in individual client datasets. Although prior work has addressed CI during training through reliable aggregation and local class distribution alignment, these methods typically rely on access to labeled data or coordination among clients, and none address class unsupervised adaptation to dynamic domains or distribution shifts at inference time under federated CI constraints. Revealing the failure of state-of-the-art TTA in federated client adaptation in CI scenario, we propose pFedBBN,a personalized federated test-time adaptation framework that employs balanced batch normalization (BBN) during local client adaptation to mitigate prediction bias by treating all classes equally, while also enabling client collaboration guided by BBN similarity, ensuring that clients with similar balanced representations reinforce each other and that adaptation remains aligned with domain-specific characteristics. pFedBBN supports fully unsupervised local adaptation and introduces a class-aware model aggregation strategy that enables personalized inference without compromising privacy. It addresses both distribution shifts and class imbalance through balanced feature normalization and domain-aware collaboration, without requiring any labeled or raw data from clients. Extensive experiments across diverse baselines show that pFedBBN consistently enhances robustness and minority-class performance over state-of-the-art FL and TTA methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fapFedBBN\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u57df\u6216\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fapFedBBN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u5730\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u6279\u91cf\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff08BBN\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u672c\u5730\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cpFedBBN\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "pFedBBN\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u6807\u8bb0\u6216\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

GRPO achieves the highest algorithmic accuracy across multiple decision layers, confirming the value of reinforcement-based optimization for structured prediction tasks.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Vulnerability-Aware Robust Multimodal Adversarial Training (VARMAT), a probe-in-training adversarial training method that improves multimodal robustness by identifying the vulnerability of each modality.

In this work, we propose a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) that learns unified representations across text, audio, and visual data, enabling end-to-end automation of metadata extraction and semantic clustering. The model is trained on the recently introduced LUMA dataset, a fully aligned benchmark of multimodal triplets representative of real-world media content. By minimizing joint reconstruction losses across modalities, the MMAE discovers modality-invariant semantic structures without relying on large paired or contrastive datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) compared to linear baselines, indicating that reconstruction-based multimodal embeddings can serve as a foundation for scalable metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval in broadcast archives.

Across 2,000 random graphs with up to 64 vertices, GNNs achieve markedly higher accuracy ($R^2=0.987$, MAE $=0.372$) than CNNs ($R^2=0.955$, MAE $=0.500$).

SciPy's spatial.transform module is a rigorously tested Python implementation. However, it historically only supported NumPy, limiting adoption in GPU-accelerated and autodiff-based workflows. We present a complete overhaul of SciPy's spatial.transform functionality that makes it compatible with any array library implementing the Python array API, including JAX, PyTorch, and CuPy. The revised implementation preserves the established SciPy interface while enabling GPU/TPU execution, JIT compilation, vectorized batching, and differentiation via native autodiff of the chosen backend. We demonstrate how this foundation supports differentiable scientific computing through two case studies: (i) scalability of 3D transforms and rotations and (ii) a JAX drone simulation that leverages SciPy's Rotation for accurate integration of rotational dynamics.

We present LocaGen, a novel spatial augmentation framework that significantly reduces fingerprinting overhead by generating high-quality synthetic data at completely unseen locations.

High variance leads to noisier gradient estimates and unstable optimization, so even equally strong pretrained MDMs and ARMs that are competitive at initialization often diverge after task-specific training, with MDMs falling far behind. There has been no theoretical explanation or systematic solution. We derive the first decomposition of MDM training variance into three sources: (A) masking pattern noise, (B) masking rate noise, and (C) data noise, while ARMs are only affected by (C). This explains the fundamental training gap. Building on this foundation, we design six variance-reduction methods, including two core methods: (1) P-POTS, a Pareto-optimal t sampler that minimizes training variance by sampling harder t values more often with appropriately smaller update steps, and (2) MIRROR, which uses negatively correlated samples to reduce (A). Experiments show that compared to standard MDM training, our methods improve accuracy by 7-8% on complex reasoning tasks, while simultaneously reducing run-to-run variability to near ARM levels, substantially narrowing the gap with strong ARM baselines; in most settings, even the best baseline runs remain below the worst run of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08MDMs\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u516d\u79cd\u964d\u65b9\u5dee\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "MDMs\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MDM\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u79cd\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u516d\u79cd\u964d\u65b9\u5dee\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5P - POTS\u548cMIRROR\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6MDM\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u73877 - 8%\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u81f3\u63a5\u8fd1\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08ARMs\uff09\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86MDMs\u4e0e\u5f3aARMs\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches rely on models trained on data from a small number of engines, which can be insufficient in generalizing across an entire population of engines due to sensor biases and variations in input conditions. In real world applications, these models require tuning or calibration to maintain acceptable error tolerance when applied to other engines. This highlights the need for models that can adapt with minimal adjustments to accommodate engine-to-engine variability and sensor discrepancies. While previous studies have explored machine learning methods for predicting engine-out NOx, these approaches often fail to generalize reliably across different engines and operating environments. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian calibration framework that combines Gaussian processes with approximate Bayesian computation to infer and correct sensor biases. Starting with a pre-trained model developed using nominal engine data, our method identifies engine specific sensor biases and recalibrates predictions accordingly. By incorporating these inferred biases, our approach generates posterior predictive distributions for engine-out NOx on unseen test data, achieving high accuracy without retraining the model.

Nighttime and dimly lit traffic scenes often suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare from vehicle headlights or street lamps, which hinder tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a fully unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for low-light traffic image enhancement. The model decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, progressively refined by three specialized modules: (1) Illumination Adaptation, for global and local brightness correction; (2) Reflectance Restoration, for noise suppression and structural detail recovery using spatial-channel attention; and (3) Over-Exposure Compensation, for reconstructing saturated regions and balancing scene luminance.

The framework combines a multi-headed actor network, a centralised critic, and an objective preference-conditioning architecture, enabling a single neural network to encode the Pareto front of optimal trade-off policies for all agents across conflicting objectives in a continuous MOMARL setting. We also outline a natural test suite for continuous MOMARL by combining a pre-existing multi-agent single-objective physics simulator with its multi-objective single-agent counterpart. Evaluating cooperative locomotion tasks in this suite, we show that our framework achieves statistically significant improvements in expected utility and hypervolume relative to outer-loop and independent training baselines, while demonstrating stable scalability as the number of agents increases.

However, existing methods often underperform on complex multi-object scenes due to unintended alterations in both personalized and non-personalized regions. This not only fails to preserve the intended prompt structure but also disrupts interactions among regions, leading to semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce plug-and-play multi-concept adaptive blending for high-fidelity text-to-image synthesis (PnP-MIX), an innovative, tuning-free approach designed to seamlessly embed multiple personalized concepts into a single generated image. Our method leverages guided appearance attention to faithfully reflect the intended appearance of each personalized concept. To further enhance compositional fidelity, we present a mask-guided noise mixing strategy that preserves the integrity of non-personalized regions such as the background or unrelated objects while enabling the precise integration of personalized objects. Finally, to mitigate concept leakage, i.e., the inadvertent leakage of personalized concept features into other regions, we propose background dilution++, a novel strategy that effectively reduces such leakage and promotes accurate localization of features within personalized regions.

Large-scale Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time-series forecasting but suffer from high computational costs, limiting their deployment in latency-sensitive web applications. To address this challenge, we propose a general inference acceleration framework that adapts speculative decoding to autoregressive time-series models.

We address key technical challenges in adapting this technique from discrete language tokens to continuous time-series distributions, including the design of acceptance criteria for multivariate Gaussian patches and practical variants that balance efficiency with accuracy. Through experiments on time series forecasting benchmarks relevant to web applications, we demonstrate significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Traditional coordination mechanisms, such as centralized oversight or adversarial adjudication, struggle to scale and often obscure how decisions emerge. We introduce a market-making framework for multi-agent large language model (LLM) coordination that organizes agent interactions as structured economic exchanges. In this setup, each agent acts as a market participant, updating and trading probabilistic beliefs, to converge toward shared, truthful outcomes. By aligning local incentives with collective epistemic goals, the framework promotes self-organizing, verifiable reasoning without requiring external enforcement. Empirically, we evaluate this approach across factual reasoning, ethical judgment, and commonsense inference tasks. Market-based coordination yields accuracy gains of up to 10% over single-shot baselines while preserving interpretability and transparency of intermediate reasoning steps. Beyond these improvements, our findings demonstrate that economic coordination principles can operationalize accountability and robustness in multi-agent LLM systems, offering a scalable pathway toward self-correcting, socially responsible AI capable of maintaining trust and oversight in real world deployment scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u505a\u5e02\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u534f\u8c03\u539f\u5219\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7ed9\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u505a\u5e02\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u5404\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u6982\u7387\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4ee5\u8fbe\u6210\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u5355\u6b21\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe10%\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u7559\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u534f\u8c03\u539f\u5219\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u8d23\u4efbAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Focusing on a UCBVI-type algorithm, we characterize the tail distribution of the cumulative regret $R_K$ over $K$ episodes, rather than only its expectation or a single high-probability quantile. We analyze two natural exploration-bonus schedules: (i) a $K$-dependent scheme that explicitly incorporates the total number of episodes $K$, and (ii) a $K$-independent scheme that depends only on the current episode index. For both settings, we obtain an upper bound on $\\Pr(R_K \\ge x)$ that exhibits a distinctive two-regime structure: a sub-Gaussian tail starting from an instance-dependent scale $m_K$ up to a transition threshold, followed by a sub-Weibull tail beyond that point. We further derive corresponding instance-dependent bounds on the expected regret $\\mathbb{E}[R_K]$. The proposed algorithm depends on a tuning parameter $\u03b1$, which balances the expected regret and the range over which the regret exhibits a sub-Gaussian tail.

Accurate prediction enables realistic simulation and strategic understanding of gameplay evolution. Most existing models are evaluated solely on per-agent accuracy metrics (minADE, minFDE), which assess each agent independently on its best-of-k prediction. However these metrics overlook whether the model learns which predicted trajectories can jointly form a plausible multi-agent future. Many state-of-the-art models are designed and optimized primarily based on these metrics. As a result, they may underperform on joint predictions and also fail to generate coherent, interpretable multi-agent scenarios in team sports. We propose CausalTraj, a temporally causal, likelihood-based model that is built to generate jointly probable multi-agent trajectory forecasts. To better assess collective modeling capability, we emphasize joint metrics (minJADE, minJFDE) that measure joint accuracy across agents within the best generated scenario sample.

Existing operator-learning approaches accelerate this process but often rely on opaque learned trunks, require extensive labeled data, or break down when boundary and source data vary independently from physical parameters. We introduce RB-DeepONet, a hybrid operator-learning framework that fuses reduced-basis (RB) numerical structure with the branch-trunk architecture of DeepONet. The trunk is fixed to a rigorously constructed RB space generated offline via Greedy selection, granting physical interpretability, stability, and certified error control. The branch network predicts only RB coefficients and is trained label-free using a projected variational residual that targets the RB-Galerkin solution. For problems with independently varying loads or boundary conditions, we develop boundary and source modal encodings that compress exogenous data into low-dimensional coordinates while preserving accuracy. Combined with affine or empirical interpolation decompositions, RB-DeepONet achieves a strict offline-online split: all heavy lifting occurs offline, and online evaluation scales only with the RB dimension rather than the full mesh. We provide convergence guarantees separating RB approximation error from statistical learning error, and numerical experiments show that RB-DeepONet attains accuracy competitive with intrusive RB-Galerkin, POD-DeepONet, and FEONet while using dramatically fewer trainable parameters and achieving significant speedups.

The challenge comes from uneven demand patterns and the resulting asymmetric flow of resources across the arcs, which create persistent imbalances at the network nodes. Resource substitution among multiple, potentially composite and interchangeable, resource types is a cost-effective way to mitigate these imbalances. This leads to the resource substitution problem, which aims at determining the minimum number of resource substitutions from an initial assignment to minimize the overall network imbalance. In decentralized settings, achieving globally coordinated solutions becomes even more difficult. When substitution entails costs, effective prescriptions must also incorporate fairness and account for the individual preferences of schedulers. This paper presents a generic framework that combines operations research (OR) and machine learning (ML) to enable fair resource substitution in large networks. The OR component models and solves the resource substitution problem under a fairness lens. The ML component leverages historical data to learn schedulers' preferences, guide intelligent exploration of the decision space, and enhance computational efficiency by dynamically selecting the top-$\u03ba$ resources for each arc in the network.

In this work, we study TabPFN through the lens of signal reconstruction and provide the first frequency-based analysis of its in-context learning behavior. We show that TabPFN possesses a broader effective frequency capacity than standard ReLU-MLPs, even without hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, unlike MLPs whose spectra evolve primarily over training epochs, we find that TabPFN's spectral capacity adapts directly to the number of samples provided in-context, a phenomenon we term Spectral Adaptivity. We further demonstrate that positional encoding modulates TabPFN's frequency response, mirroring classical results in implicit neural representations. Finally, we show that these properties enable TabPFN to perform training-free and hyperparameter-free image denoising, illustrating its potential as a task-agnostic implicit model. Our analysis provides new insight into the structure and inductive biases of tabular foundation models and highlights their promise for broader signal reconstruction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76TabPFN\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u9891\u7387\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bTabPFN\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u6765\u6e90\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u89d2\u5ea6\u5bf9TabPFN\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "TabPFN\u6709\u6548\u9891\u7387\u5bb9\u91cf\u66f4\u5e7f\uff0c\u6709\u9891\u8c31\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u5176\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u514d\u8d85\u53c2\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u5176\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Everyday environments are rich in tangible control interfaces (TCIs), e.g., light switches, appliance panels, and embedded GUIs, that demand commonsense and physics reasoning, but also causal prediction and outcome verification in time and space (e.g., delayed heating, remote lights). Moreover, failures here have potential safety implications, yet current benchmarks rarely test grounding, partial observability (video), or post-hoc verification in situated settings. We introduce SWITCH (Semantic World Interface Tasks for Control and Handling), an embodied, task-driven benchmark created through iterative releases to probe these gaps. Its first iteration, SWITCH-Basic, evaluates five complementary abilities:task-aware VQA, semantic UI grounding, action generation, state-transition prediction, and result verification, under egocentric RGB video input and device diversity. Across 351 tasks spanning 98 real devices and appliances, commercial and open LMMMs exhibit inconsistent performance even on single-step interactions, often over-relying on textual cues and under-using visual or video evidence (and high aggregate scores can mask such failures).

However, existing methods typically constrained to modeling direct associations, such as Perturbation $\\rightarrow$ RNA or Perturbation $\\rightarrow$ Morphology, overlook the crucial causal link from RNA to morphology. To bridge this gap, we propose TRIDENT, a cascade generative framework that synthesizes realistic cellular morphology by conditioning on both the perturbation and the corresponding gene expression profile. To train and evaluate this task, we construct MorphoGene, a new dataset pairing L1000 gene expression with Cell Painting images for 98 compounds. TRIDENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 7-fold improvement with strong generalization to unseen compounds. In a case study on docetaxel, we validate that RNA-guided synthesis accurately produces the corresponding phenotype. An ablation study further confirms that this RNA conditioning is essential for the model's high fidelity.

The study moves the needle forward in a number of ways, including (1) full standardization of assessment with respect to preprocessing, training sets/protocols (optimizing networks with the AdamW optimizer, CosineAnnealingLR, patiene for early stopping = 7), and metrics to assess performance were identical along all models; (2) a high level of confidence in the localizations based on prior studies as both Grad-CAM and GradientShap explanation were used to establish anatomically important and meaningful attention regions and address the black-box issue; (3) a compact 1.31 million parameter CNN was developed that achieved 96.49% testing accuracy and was 100 times smaller than Inception-ResNet V2 while permitting real-time inference (375ms) on edge devices; (4) full evaluation beyond accuracy reporting based on measures of intersection over union, Hausdorff distance, and precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices across all splits. Inception-ResNet V2 reached state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 99.53% accuracy on testing and obtaining a precision, recall, and F1-score of at least 99.50% dominant performance based on metrics of recent studies. We demonstrated a lightweight model that is suitable to deploy on devices that do not have multi-GPU infrastructure in under-resourced settings. This end-to-end solution considers accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of trustworthy AI to create the framework necessary for performance assessment and deployment within advance and low-resource healthcare systems to an extent that enabled participation at the clinical screening and triage level.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8eMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u542b\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u63a8\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6848\u517c\u987e\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u4e8eMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u4e94\u4e2aImageNet\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49CNN\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528AdamW\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3001CosineAnnealingLR\u7b49\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7528Grad - CAM\u548cGradientShap\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "Inception - ResNet V2\u8fbe99.53%\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7b49\uff0c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49CNN\u8fbe96.49%\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

We introduce \\textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity as a potential solution to improve verification efficiency. However, there lacks a joint framework that considers all chip design domain knowledge, graph theory, and GPU kernel designs. To address this challenge, we introduce GROOT, an algorithm and system co-design framework that contains chip design domain knowledge and redesigned GPU kernels, to improve verification efficiency. More specifically, we create node features utilizing the circuit node types and the polarity of the connections between the input edges to nodes in And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs). We utilize a graph partitioning algorithm to divide the large graphs into smaller sub-graphs for fast GPU processing and develop a graph edge re-growth algorithm to recover verification accuracy. We carefully profile the EDA graph workloads and observe the uniqueness of their polarized distribution of high degree (HD) nodes and low degree (LD) nodes. We redesign two GPU kernels (HD-kernel and LD-kernel), to fit the EDA graph learning workload on a single GPU. We compare the results with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods: GAMORA, a GNN-based approach, and the traditional ABC framework. Results show that GROOT achieves a significant reduction in memory footprint (59.38 %), with high accuracy (99.96%) for a very large CSA multiplier, i.e. 1,024 bits with a batch size of 16, which consists of 134,103,040 nodes and 268,140,544 edges. We compare GROOT with GPU-based GPU Kernel designs SOTAs such as cuSPARSE, MergePath-SpMM, and GNNAdvisor.

Recently, synthesizing data via diffusion models is viewed as a promising solution. However, existing methods still struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and complex channel interrelations. In this research, we aim to utilize the sequence modeling capability of a State Space Model called Mamba to extend its applicability to time series data generation. We firstly analyze the core limitations in State Space Model, namely the lack of consideration for correlated temporal lag and channel permutation. Building upon the insight, we propose Lag Fusion Mamba and Permutation Scanning Mamba, which enhance the model's ability to discern significant patterns during the denoising process.

This paper presents a comparative analysis of the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks for two leading publicly available LLMs, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and OpenAI's GPT-4 (specifically the GPT-4o mini model accessible in the free tier). The research utilized two main bypass strategies: 'self-bypass', where models were prompted to circumvent their own safety protocols, and 'cross-bypass', where one model generated adversarial prompts to exploit vulnerabilities in the other. Four attack methods were employed - direct injection, role-playing, context manipulation, and obfuscation - to generate five distinct categories of unsafe content: hate speech, illegal activities, malicious code, dangerous content, and misinformation. The success of the attack was determined by the generation of disallowed content, with successful jailbreaks assigned a severity score. The findings indicate a disparity in jailbreak susceptibility between 2.5 Flash and GPT-4, suggesting variations in their safety implementations or architectural design. Cross-bypass attacks were particularly effective, indicating that an ample amount of vulnerabilities exist in the underlying transformer architecture.

However, existing approaches rely on rigid routing strategies (typically activating a fixed number of experts per token) ignoring the inherent heterogeneity in semantic importance across modalities. This leads to suboptimal compute allocation, where redundant tokens consume as many resources as critical ones. To address this, we propose AnyExperts, a novel on-demand, budget-aware dynamic routing framework that allocates a variable total number of expert slots per token based on its semantic importance. Crucially, to prevent uncontrolled compute growth, the total slots per token are constrained within a fixed range, and each slot is filled by either a real expert or a virtual expert, with the virtual share capped at a small maximum (e.g., 20%). The model then adaptively balances the real-to-virtual ratio per token, assigning more real experts to semantically rich regions and relying more on virtual experts for redundant content. Evaluated across diverse tasks in visual understanding, audio understanding, and NLP understanding, AnyExperts improves performance under the same compute budget. Notably, on general image/video tasks, it achieves comparable accuracy with 40% fewer real expert activations; on text-dense tasks (OCR and NLP), it maintains performance while reducing real expert usage by 10%.

These infections often go unnoticed until they become severe, making early detection through innovative smart home technologies crucial. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches relying on simple binary classification for UTI detection offer limited utility to nurses and practitioners as they lack insight into prediction uncertainty, hindering informed clinical decision-making. This paper presents a clinician-in-the-loop (CIL) smart home system that leverages ambient sensor data to extract meaningful behavioral markers, train robust predictive ML models, and calibrate them to enable uncertainty-aware decision support. The system incorporates a statistically valid uncertainty quantification method called Conformal-Calibrated Interval (CCI), which quantifies uncertainty and abstains from making predictions (\"I don't know\") when the ML model's confidence is low. Evaluated on real-world data from eight smart homes, our method outperforms baseline methods in recall and other classification metrics while maintaining the lowest abstention proportion and interval width. A survey of 42 nurses confirms that our system's outputs are valuable for guiding clinical decision-making, underscoring their practical utility in improving informed decisions and effectively managing UTIs and other condition flare-ups in older adults.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u5c3f\u8def\u611f\u67d3\u590d\u53d1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CCI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u83b7\u62a4\u58eb\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002", "motivation": "\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u6162\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4f34\u53d1\u7684\u5c3f\u8def\u611f\u67d3\u590d\u53d1\u5371\u5bb3\u5927\u4e14\u96be\u65e9\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u884c\u4e3a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Conformal - Calibrated Interval (CCI)\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7b49\u5206\u7c7b\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f4e\u5f03\u6743\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u533a\u95f4\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff1b42\u540d\u62a4\u58eb\u8c03\u67e5\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u5c3f\u8def\u611f\u67d3\u7b49\u75be\u75c5\u590d\u53d1\u3002"}}

ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \\ Gene \\ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAGL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u57fa\u56e0\uff0c\u7528DkGSB\u9009\u62e9\u8f85\u52a9\u57fa\u56e0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "ST\u6280\u672f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6709\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u7528\u9ad8\u53d8\u57fa\u56e0\uff0c\u4f4e\u8868\u8fbe\u57fa\u56e0\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAGL\u5c06\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u4e3b\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u63d0\u51faDkGSB\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u57fa\u56e0\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5faetop - k\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7eb3\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u57fa\u56e0\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u57fa\u56e0\u7684AGL\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cDkGSB\u57fa\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional solutions, such as regulatory actions, have been implemented to mitigate the spread of misinformation; however, these measures alone are not sufficient. To complement these efforts, educational approaches are becoming essential in empowering users to critically engage with misinformation. Conversation training, through serious games or personalized methods, has emerged as a promising strategy to help users handle science denial and toxic conversation tactics. This paper suggests an interdisciplinary seminar to explore the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as a persona of a science denier to support people in identifying misinformation and improving resilience against toxic interactions. In the seminar, groups of four to five students will develop an AI-based chatbot that enables realistic interactions with science-denial argumentation structures. The task involves planning the setting, integrating a Large Language Model to facilitate natural dialogues, implementing the chatbot using the RASA framework, and evaluating the outcomes in a user study. It is crucial that users understand what they need to do during the interaction, how to conclude it, and how the relevant information is conveyed. The seminar does not aim to develop chatbots for practicing debunking but serves to teach AI technologies and test the feasibility of this idea for future applications. The chatbot seminar is conducted as a hybrid, parallel master's module at the participating educational institutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u79d1\u5b66\u5426\u5b9a\u548c\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u6cdb\u6ee5\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7ba1\u63aa\u65bd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff0c\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u79d1\u5b66\u5426\u5b9a\u8005\uff0c\u8ba9\u5b66\u751f\u5f00\u53d1\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u4e5f\u662f\u7855\u58eb\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u79d1\u5b66\u5426\u5b9a\u548c\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7ba1\u63aa\u65bd\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u9700\u6559\u80b2\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u79d1\u5b66\u5426\u5b9a\u8005\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4e3e\u529e\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff0c\u8ba94 - 5\u4eba\u5c0f\u7ec4\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c4\u5212\u573a\u666f\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7528RASA\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u76ee\u7684\u4e0d\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u4e8e\u8f9f\u8c23\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6559\u6388AI\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8be5\u60f3\u6cd5\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing studies remain limited in addressing two main challenges of multi-view molecular learning: (1) discovering shared information between two views while diminishing view-specific information and (2) identifying and aligning important substructures, e.g., functional groups, which are crucial for enhancing cross-view consistency and model expressiveness. To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck framework, called MVCIB, for pre-training graph neural networks on 2D and 3D molecular structures in a self-supervised setting. Our idea is to discover the shared information while minimizing irrelevant features from each view under the MVCIB principle, which uses one view as a contextual condition to guide the representation learning of its counterpart. To enhance semantic and structural consistency across views, we utilize key substructures, e.g., functional groups and ego-networks, as anchors between the two views. Then, we propose a cross-attention mechanism that captures fine-grained correlations between the substructures to achieve subgraph alignment across views.

As large language models increasingly enable the creation of sophisticated fake news, understanding human detection capabilities becomes crucial, particularly across different cultural contexts. We conducted a survey where 89 participants (56 South Africans, 33 from other nationalities) evaluated 10 true South African news articles and 10 AI-generated fake versions. Results reveal an asymmetric pattern: South Africans demonstrated superior performance in detecting true news about their country (40% deviation from ideal rating) compared to other participants (52%), but performed worse at identifying fake news (62% vs. 55%). This difference may reflect South Africans' higher overall trust in news sources. Our analysis further shows that South Africans relied more on content knowledge and contextual understanding when judging credibility, while participants from other countries emphasised formal linguistic features such as grammar and structure. Overall, the deviation from ideal rating was similar between groups (51% vs. 53%), suggesting that cultural familiarity appears to aid verification of authentic information but may also introduce bias when evaluating fabricated content.

It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration.

Existing CTTA methods, however, often rely on source data or prototypes, limiting their applicability in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings. Additionally, these methods suffer from long-term forgetting, which degrades performance on previously encountered domains as target domains shift. To address these challenges, we propose SloMo-Fast, a source-free, dual-teacher CTTA framework designed for enhanced adaptability and generalization. It includes two complementary teachers: the Slow-Teacher, which exhibits slow forgetting and retains long-term knowledge of previously encountered domains to ensure robust generalization, and the Fast-Teacher rapidly adapts to new domains while accumulating and integrating knowledge across them. This framework preserves knowledge of past domains and adapts efficiently to new ones. We also introduce Cyclic Test-Time Adaptation (Cyclic-TTA), a novel CTTA benchmark that simulates recurring domain shifts.

While Graph Neural Networks can handle the irregular meshes required for complex geometries and boundary conditions, they still apply uniform computational effort across all nodes regardless of the underlying physics complexity.

We address this challenge by introducing Adaptive Mesh Quantization: spatially adaptive quantization across mesh node, edge, and cluster features, dynamically adjusting the bit-width used by a quantized model. We propose an adaptive bit-width allocation strategy driven by a lightweight auxiliary model that identifies high-loss regions in the input mesh. This enables dynamic resource distribution in the main model, where regions of higher difficulty are allocated increased bit-width, optimizing computational resource utilization. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness by integrating it with two state-of-the-art models, MP-PDE and GraphViT, to evaluate performance across multiple tasks: 2D Darcy flow, large-scale unsteady fluid dynamics in 2D, steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations in 3D, and a 2D hyper-elasticity problem.

Today, that gateway is widening with advances in large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered coding assistants. What matters is no longer just fluency in traditional programming languages but the ability to think computationally by translating problems into forms that can be solved with computing tools. The capabilities enabled by these AI-augmented tools are rapidly leading to the commoditization of computational thinking, such that anyone who can articulate a problem in natural language can potentially harness computing power via AI.\n  This shift is poised to radically influence how we teach computer science and data science in the United States and around the world. Educators and industry leaders are grappling with how to adapt: What should students learn when the hottest new programming language is English? How do we prepare a generation of computational thinkers who need not code every algorithm manually, but must still think critically, design solutions, and verify AI-augmented results?\n  This paper explores these questions, examining the impact of natural language programming on software development, the emerging distinction between programmers and prompt-crafting problem solvers, the reforms needed in computer science and data science curricula, and the importance of maintaining our fundamental computational science principles in an AI-augmented future. Along the way, we compare approaches and share best practices for embracing this new paradigm in computing education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cAI\u7f16\u7801\u52a9\u624b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7f16\u7a0b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7a0b\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cAI\u7f16\u7801\u52a9\u624b\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u7f16\u7a0b\u80fd\u529b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u5f00\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7a0b\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7f16\u5199\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8005\u7684\u533a\u522b\u3001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6539\u9769\u9700\u6c42\u53ca\u575a\u6301\u57fa\u7840\u8ba1\u7b97\u79d1\u5b66\u539f\u5219\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5206\u4eab\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

We propose Residual Risk-Aware Physics-Informed Neural Networks PINNs (RRaPINNs), a single-network framework that optimizes tail-focused objectives using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), we also introduced a Mean-Excess (ME) surrogate penalty to directly control worst-case PDE residuals. This casts PINN training as risk-sensitive optimization and links it to chance-constrained formulations. The method is effective and simple to implement. Across several partial differential equations (PDEs) such as Burgers, Heat, Korteweg-de-Vries, and Poisson (including a Poisson interface problem with a source jump at x=0.5) equations, RRaPINNs reduce tail residuals while maintaining or improving mean errors compared to vanilla PINNs, Residual-Based Attention and its variant using convolution weighting; the ME surrogate yields smoother optimization than a direct CVaR hinge. The chance constraint reliability level $\u03b1$ acts as a transparent knob trading bulk accuracy (lower $\u03b1$ ) for stricter tail control (higher $\u03b1$ ). We discuss the framework limitations, including memoryless sampling, global-only tail budgeting, and residual-centric risk, and outline remedies via persistent hard-point replay, local risk budgets, and multi-objective risk over BC/IC terms.

We use controlled experiments with repeated textual and visual items and analyze model behavior through causal mediation and activation patching. To this end, we design a specialized tool, CountScope, for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content. Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions.

We introduce CHIPS (Curvature-aware Hybrid Influence in Projection Subspace), which assigns each image-text pair a utility score that integrates three complementary factors aligned with three goals: faithfulness via a curvature-aware, Newton-style alignment computed in CLIP's end-point subspace; scalability via an InfoNCE-aware curvature estimator with Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) sketching; and retention via a selection-aware relevance weight combined with learnability to balance target adaptation against general-domain preservation. We justify this design theoretically by proving a lower-bound guarantee on the proxy's correlation with full-parameter alignment and by characterizing the bias-variance trade-offs introduced by curvature mixing and JL sketching. We evaluate CHIPS empirically across various settings: 1) CHIPS attains state-of-the-art performance among selection baselines on 17 medical benchmarks, matches full-dataset CPT with 30% of the data, and outperforms half-dataset CPT using only 10%; 2) on 31 general-domain benchmarks, CHIPS yields the smallest performance drop under 10-30% data-retention budgets.

However, these structures rely on a binary multiplication operator and therefore model only pairwise interactions. Many symbolic AI tasks are inherently triadic, including subject-predicate-object relations in knowledge graphs, logical rules involving two premises and one conclusion, and multi-entity dependencies in structured decision processes. Existing neural architectures usually approximate these interactions by flattening or factorizing them into binary components, which weakens inductive structure, distorts relational meaning, and reduces interpretability.\n  This paper introduces the Neural Ternary Semiring (NTS), a learnable and differentiable algebraic framework grounded in the theory of ternary Gamma-semirings. The central idea is to replace the usual binary product with a native ternary operator implemented by neural networks and guided by algebraic regularizers enforcing approximate associativity and distributivity.

We present a variational autoencoder (VAE) approach that achieves x514 compression of NASA's TEMPO satellite hyperspectral observations (1028 channels, 290-490nm) with reconstruction errors 1-2 orders of magnitude below the signal across all wavelengths. This dramatic data volume reduction enables efficient archival and sharing of satellite observations while preserving spectral fidelity. Beyond compression, we investigate to what extent atmospheric information is retained in the compressed latent space by training linear and nonlinear probes to extract Level-2 products (NO2, O3, HCHO, cloud fraction). Cloud fraction and total ozone achieve strong extraction performance (R^2 = 0.93 and 0.81 respectively), though these represent relatively straightforward retrievals given their distinct spectral signatures. In contrast, tropospheric trace gases pose genuine challenges for extraction (NO2 R^2 = 0.20, HCHO R^2 = 0.51) reflecting their weaker signals and complex atmospheric interactions. Critically, we find the VAE encodes atmospheric information in a semi-linear manner - nonlinear probes substantially outperform linear ones - and that explicit latent supervision during training provides minimal improvement, revealing fundamental encoding challenges for certain products. This work demonstrates that neural compression can dramatically reduce hyperspectral data volumes while preserving key atmospheric signals, addressing a critical bottleneck for next-generation Earth observation systems.

This problem is dramatically exacerbated when attempting to combine them with modern, efficient MLP-based backbones. To resolve this fundamental incompatibility, we propose TimePre, a novel framework that successfully unifies the efficiency of MLP-based models with the distributional flexibility of the MCL paradigm. The core of our solution is Stabilized Instance Normalization (SIN), a novel normalization layer that explicitly remedies this incompatibility. SIN stabilizes the hybrid architecture by correcting channel-wise statistical shifts, definitively resolving the catastrophic hypothesis collapse. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimePre achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on key probabilistic metrics.

This need arises from the high sampling rate of EEG data and the long recording durations required to capture extended neurological patterns in brain activity. Transformer-based models have shown promise in modeling short sequences of a few seconds; however, their quadratic complexity limits scalability to longer contexts. Moreover, variability in electrode montage across available datasets, along with inter-subject differences in brain signals, pose significant challenges to developing a generalizable and robust foundation model. We propose \\textit{SAMBA}, a self-supervised learning framework with a Mamba-based U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture, which effectively captures long-range temporal dependencies and spatial variability in EEG data. Leveraging the inherent ability of Mamba in processing long context sizes, we introduce: (1) \\textit{Temporal Semantic Random Masking} for semantic-level sequence reconstruction, (2) a \\textit{Multi-Head Differential Mamba} module to suppress redundancy and emphasize salient temporal structures, and (3) a \\textit{Spatial-Adaptive Input Embedding} that learns unified embeddings in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, enabling robustness across devices. Experiments on thirteen EEG datasets across diverse tasks, electrode configurations, and sequence durations demonstrate that SAMBA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low memory consumption and inference time. We also show the learned spatial weight maps from our embedding module align closely with task-relevant neurophysiological regions, demonstrating the learnability and interpretability of SAMBA.

Foundation models offer a path toward assisting with the full spectrum of radiology tasks, but existing medical models remain limited: they process volumetric CT and MRI as low-fidelity 2D slices, discard critical grayscale contrast information, and lack evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical practice.

Pillar-0 similarly outperforms all baselines in an external validation on the Stanford Abdominal CT dataset, including Merlin (82.2 vs 80.6 AUROC). Pillar-0 extends to tasks beyond its pretraining, such as long-horizon lung cancer risk prediction, where it improves upon the state-of-the-art Sybil by 3.0 C-index points on NLST, and generalizes with gains of 5.9 (MGH) and 1.9 (CGMH). In brain hemorrhage detection, Pillar-0 obtained a >95 AUROC when using only 1/20th of the data of the next most sample efficient baseline.

Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression.

Independent sampling often yields high-variance estimates, especially when rare but with high-impact outcomes dominate the expectation. We propose an importance-weighted non-IID sampling framework that jointly draws multiple samples to cover diverse, salient regions of a flow's distribution while maintaining unbiased estimation via estimated importance weights. To balance diversity and quality, we introduce a score-based regularization for the diversity mechanism, which uses the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log probability, to ensure samples are pushed apart within high-density regions of the data manifold, mitigating off-manifold drift. We further develop the first approach for importance weighting of non-IID flow samples by learning a residual velocity field that reproduces the marginal distribution of the non-IID samples. Empirically, our method produces diverse, high-quality samples and accurate estimates of both importance weights and expectations, advancing the reliable characterization of flow-matching model outputs.

We introduce FOS (Future Of Science), a comprehensive time-aware graph-based benchmark that reconstructs annual co-occurrence graphs of 65,027 research sub-fields (spanning 19 general domains) over the period 1827-2024. In these graphs, edges denote the co-occurrence of two fields in a single publication and are timestamped with the corresponding publication year. Nodes are enriched with semantic embeddings, and edges are characterized by temporal and topological descriptors. We formulate the prediction of new field-pair linkages as a temporal link-prediction task, emphasizing the \"first-time\" connections that signify pioneering interdisciplinary directions.

The chatbot was fine-tuned using a hybrid corpus of real and synthetically generated medical dialogues, while model efficiency was optimized via Low-Rank Adaptation. A secure and isolated database interface was implemented to ensure complete separation between patient data and the inference process. The avatar component was realized through a conditional diffusion model operating in latent space, trained on researcher video datasets and synchronized with mel-frequency audio features for realistic speech and facial animation.\n  Unlike existing cloud-based systems, this work demonstrates the feasibility of a fully offline, locally deployable LLM-diffusion framework for clinical anamnesis. The autoencoder and diffusion networks exhibited smooth convergence, and MedChat achieved stable fine-tuning with strong generalization to unseen data.

While 4-bit KV quantization preserves accuracy, 2-bit often degrades it, especially on long-context reasoning. We close this gap via an algorithm-system co-design for mixed-precision KV caching: Kitty. On the algorithm side, extensive experiments show that Dynamic Channel-wise Precision Boost -- which ranks Key-cache channels by sensitivity and keeps only a small fraction at higher precision -- maintains near-zero loss in accuracy drop while approaching 2-bit memory. The main challenge is handling dynamic 4-bit channel boosts while keeping the page layout coalesced and the dequantization uniform, with no scattered reads or hard-coded masks. Kitty addresses these issues by decompose each mixed-precision Key page into two tensors with unified 2-bit precision. Based on this, Kitty provides a page-centric KV layout, Triton-compatible page dequantization kernels, and a lightweight runtime pipeline that preserves coalescing and avoids divergence. Across seven tasks and two model families (Qwen3, LLaMA3), Kitty cuts KV memory by nearly 8x with negligible accuracy loss, enabling up to 8x larger batches and 2.1x-4.1x higher throughput under the same memory budget.

Previous work, like IBM Project Debater, focused on generating persuasive speeches in simplified and shortened debate formats intended for relatively lay audiences. We introduce DeepDebater, a novel autonomous system capable of participating in and winning a full, unmodified, two-team competitive policy debate. Our system employs a hierarchical architecture of specialized multi-agent workflows, where teams of LLM-powered agents collaborate and critique one another to perform discrete argumentative tasks. Each workflow utilizes iterative retrieval, synthesis, and self-correction using a massive corpus of policy debate evidence (OpenDebateEvidence) and produces complete speech transcripts, cross-examinations, and rebuttals. We introduce a live, interactive end-to-end presentation pipeline that renders debates with AI speech and animation: transcripts are surface-realized and synthesized to audio with OpenAI TTS, and then displayed as talking-head portrait videos with EchoMimic V1. Beyond fully autonomous matches (AI vs AI), DeepDebater supports hybrid human-AI operation: human debaters can intervene at any stage, and humans can optionally serve as opponents against AI in any speech, allowing AI-human and AI-AI rounds. In preliminary evaluations against human-authored cases, DeepDebater produces qualitatively superior argumentative components and consistently wins simulated rounds as adjudicated by an independent autonomous judge.

Although KANs offer strong expressivity and interpretability, their heterogeneous spline and base branch parameters hinder efficient quantization, which remains unexamined compared to CNNs and Transformers. In this paper, we present QuantKAN, a unified framework for quantizing KANs across both quantization aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) regimes. QuantKAN extends modern quantization algorithms, such as LSQ, LSQ+, PACT, DoReFa, QIL, GPTQ, BRECQ, AdaRound, AWQ, and HAWQ-V2, to spline based layers with branch-specific quantizers for base, spline, and activation components. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR 10, and CIFAR 100 across multiple KAN variants (EfficientKAN, FastKAN, PyKAN, and KAGN), we establish the first systematic benchmarks for low-bit spline networks. Our results show that KANs, particularly deeper KAGN variants, are compatible with low-bit quantization but exhibit strong method architecture interactions: LSQ, LSQ+, and PACT preserve near full precision accuracy at 4 bit for shallow KAN MLP and ConvNet models, while DoReFa provides the most stable behavior for deeper KAGN under aggressive low-bit settings. For PTQ, GPTQ and Uniform consistently deliver the strongest overall performance across datasets, with BRECQ highly competitive on simpler regimes such as MNIST.

However, conventional Distribution Matching (DM) methods struggle to capture intrinsic cross-modal alignment. Subsequent studies have attempted to introduce cross-modal matching, but two major challenges remain: (i) independently and randomly initialized encoders lead to inconsistent modality mapping spaces, increasing training difficulty; and (ii) direct interactions between modalities tend to damage modality-specific (private) information, thereby degrading the quality of the distilled data. To address these challenges, we propose DAVDD, a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework. DAVDD leverages a diverse pretrained bank to obtain stable modality features and uses a lightweight decoupler bank to disentangle them into common and private representations. To effectively preserve cross-modal structure, we further introduce Common Intermodal Matching together with a Sample-Distribution Joint Alignment strategy, ensuring that shared representations are aligned both at the sample level and the global distribution level.

To address these challenges, we introduce GRIT-LP, a graph transformer explicitly designed for polar ice-layer thickness estimation from polar radar imagery. Accurately estimating ice layer thickness is critical for understanding snow accumulation, reconstructing past climate patterns and reducing uncertainties in projections of future ice sheet evolution and sea level rise. GRIT-LP combines an inductive geometric graph learning framework with self-attention mechanism, and introduces two major innovations that jointly address challenges in modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of ice layers: a partitioned spatial graph construction strategy that forms overlapping, fully connected local neighborhoods to preserve spatial coherence and suppress noise from irrelevant long-range links, and a long-range skip connection mechanism within the transformer that improves information flow and mitigates oversmoothing in deeper attention layers. We conducted extensive experiments, demonstrating that GRIT-LP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 24.92\\% improvement in root mean squared error.

However, existing research primarily focuses on balanced datasets and struggles to perform under real-world long-tailed distributions. In this work, we emphasize the critical role of soft labels in long-tailed dataset distillation and uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to performance degradation. Specifically, we derive an imbalance-aware generalization bound for model trained on distilled dataset. We then identify two primary sources of soft-label bias, which originate from the distillation model and the distilled images, through systematic perturbation of the data imbalance levels. To address this, we propose ADSA, an Adaptive Soft-label Alignment module that calibrates the entangled biases. This lightweight module integrates seamlessly into existing distillation pipelines and consistently improves performance. On ImageNet-1k-LT with EDC and IPC=50, ADSA improves tail-class accuracy by up to 11.8% and raises overall accuracy to 41.4%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSA provides a robust and generalizable solution under limited label budgets and across a range of distillation techniques.

Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency.

We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning.

Recent Structured State-Space Models such as Mamba have demonstrated potential in TAD due to their long-range modeling capability and linear computational complexity. On the other hand, structured state-space models often face two key challenges in TAD, namely, decay of temporal context due to recursive processing and self-element conflict during global visual context modeling, which become more severe while handling long-span action instances. Additionally, traditional methods for TAD struggle with detecting long-span action instances due to a lack of global awareness and inefficient detection heads. This paper presents MambaTAD, a new state-space TAD model that introduces long-range modeling and global feature detection capabilities for accurate temporal action detection. MambaTAD comprises two novel designs that complement each other with superior TAD performance. First, it introduces a Diagonal-Masked Bidirectional State-Space (DMBSS) module which effectively facilitates global feature fusion and temporal action detection.

Prior work attempts to detect hallucination with model-internal signals such as token-level entropy or generation consistency, while the connection between pretraining data exposure and hallucination is underexplored. Existing studies show that LLMs underperform on long-tail knowledge, i.e., the accuracy of the generated answer drops for the ground-truth entities that are rare in pretraining. However, examining whether data coverage itself can serve as a detection signal is overlooked. We propose a complementary question: Does lexical training-data coverage of the question and/or generated answer provide additional signal for hallucination detection? To investigate this, we construct scalable suffix arrays over RedPajama's 1.3-trillion-token pretraining corpus to retrieve $n$-gram statistics for both prompts and model generations. We evaluate their effectiveness for hallucination detection across three QA benchmarks. Our observations show that while occurrence-based features are weak predictors when used alone, they yield modest gains when combined with log-probabilities, particularly on datasets with higher intrinsic model uncertainty.

We argue that permission-based access control is indispensable in providing meaningful control to the users, but conventional permission models are inadequate for the automated agentic execution paradigm. We therefore propose automated permission management for AI agents. Our key idea is to conduct a user study to identify the factors influencing users' permission decisions and to encode these factors into an ML-based permission management assistant capable of predicting users' future decisions. We find that participants' permission decisions are influenced by communication context but importantly individual preferences tend to remain consistent within contexts, and align with those of other participants. Leveraging these insights, we develop a permission prediction model achieving 85.1% accuracy overall and 94.4% for high-confidence predictions.

In recent years, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) have been widely used to capture complex high-order relationships. However, most existing hypergraph neural network methods inherently rely on the homophily assumption, which often does not hold in real-world scenarios that exhibit significant heterophilic structures. To address this limitation, we propose \\textbf{HONOR}, a novel unsupervised \\textbf{H}ypergraph c\\textbf{ON}trastive learning framework suitable for both hom\\textbf{O}philic and hete\\textbf{R}ophilic hypergraphs. Specifically, HONOR explicitly models the heterophilic relationships between hyperedges and nodes through two complementary mechanisms: a prompt-based hyperedge feature construction strategy that maintains global semantic consistency while suppressing local noise, and an adaptive attention aggregation module that dynamically captures the diverse local contributions of nodes to hyperedges.

To address this, we propose a vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline and develop the VITAL-Series LMMs. (1) We adopt a machine-executed annotation-scrutiny paradigm, constructing over 4.5M vision-language (VL) pairs-the largest VQualA training dataset to date. (2) We employ a multi-task training workflow that simultaneously enhances the model's quantitative scoring precision and strengthens its capability for quality interpretation across both image and video modalities. (3) Building upon the vision encoder, we realize an efficient model zoo extension: the model zoo exhibits strong zero-shot performance, and each paired decoder requires only a swift warm-up using less than 1/1000 of the pre-training data to achieve performance comparable to the fully trained counterpart.

However, existing studies focus primarily on its algorithmic advantages such as accuracy and compression ratio-while overlooking the hardware deployment efficiency. Such hardware-unaware designs often obscure the potential latency and energy benefits of tensorized models. Although several works attempt to reduce computational cost by optimizing the contraction sequence based on the number of multiply-accumulate operations, they typically neglect the underlying hardware characteristics, resulting in suboptimal real-world performance. We observe that the contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping are tightly coupled and must be optimized jointly within a unified design space to maximize deployment efficiency on real devices. To this end, we propose a co-exploration framework that unifies these dimensions within a unified design space for efficient training and inference of tensorized neural networks on edge platforms. The framework formulates a latency oriented search objective and solves it via a global latency-driven exploration across the unified design space to achieve end-to-end model efficiency.

Despite that GFMs have attracted considerable attention recently, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. A compromised GFM can introduce backdoor behaviors into downstream applications, posing serious security risks. However, launching backdoor attacks against GFMs is non-trivial due to three key challenges. (1) Effectiveness: Attackers lack knowledge of the downstream task during pre-training, complicating the assurance that triggers reliably induce misclassifications into desired classes. (2) Stealthiness: The variability in node features across domains complicates trigger insertion that remains stealthy. (3) Persistence: Downstream fine-tuning may erase backdoor behaviors by updating model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose GFM-BA, a novel Backdoor Attack model against Graph Foundation Models. Specifically, we first design a label-free trigger association module that links the trigger to a set of prototype embeddings, eliminating the need for knowledge about downstream tasks to perform backdoor injection. Then, we introduce a node-adaptive trigger generator, dynamically producing node-specific triggers, reducing the risk of trigger detection while reliably activating the backdoor. Lastly, we develop a persistent backdoor anchoring module that firmly anchors the backdoor to fine-tuning-insensitive parameters, enhancing the persistence of the backdoor under downstream adaptation.

To address these challenges, we propose Plan-X, a framework that explicitly enforces high-level semantic planning to instruct video generation process. At its core lies a Semantic Planner, a learnable multimodal language model that reasons over the user's intent from both text prompts and visual context, and autoregressively generates a sequence of text-grounded spatio-temporal semantic tokens. These semantic tokens, complementary to high-level text prompt guidance, serve as structured \"semantic sketches\" over time for the video diffusion model, which has its strength at synthesizing high-fidelity visual details. Plan-X effectively integrates the strength of language models in multimodal in-context reasoning and planning, together with the strength of diffusion models in photorealistic video synthesis.

While existing literature has designed many sophisticated decomposition approaches based on the time or frequency domain to partition trend-seasonality components and high-low frequency components, an alternative line of approaches based on the wavelet domain has been proposed to provide a unified multi-resolution representation with precise time-frequency localization. However, most wavelet-based methods suffer from a persistent bias toward recursively decomposing only low-frequency components, severely underutilizing subtle yet informative high-frequency components that are pivotal for precise time series forecasting. To address this problem, we propose WaveTuner, a Wavelet decomposition framework empowered by full-spectrum subband Tuning for time series forecasting. Concretely, WaveTuner comprises two key modules: (i) Adaptive Wavelet Refinement module, that transforms time series into time-frequency coefficients, utilizes an adaptive router to dynamically assign subband weights, and generates subband-specific embeddings to support refinement; and (ii) Multi-Branch Specialization module, that employs multiple functional branches, each instantiated as a flexible Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with a distinct functional order to model a specific spectral subband. Equipped with these modules, WaveTuner comprehensively tunes global trends and local variations within a unified time-frequency framework.

One representative fine-tuning method is to exploit adapter (termed AdapterGNN) which aims to 'augment' the pre-trained model by inserting a lightweight module to make the 'augmented' model better adapt to the downstream tasks. However, graph data may contain various types of noise in downstream tasks, such as noisy edges and ambiguous node attributes. Existing AdapterGNNs are often prone to graph noise and exhibit limited generalizability. How to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of GNNs' fine tuning remains an open problem. In this paper, we show that the above problem can be well addressed by integrating uncertainty learning into the GNN adapter. We propose the Uncertainty-aware Adapter (UAdapterGNN) that fortifies pre-trained GNN models against noisy graph data in the fine-tuning process. Specifically, in contrast to regular AdapterGNN, our UAdapterGNN exploits Gaussian probabilistic adapter to augment the pre-trained GNN model. In this way, when the graph contains various noises,our method can automatically absorb the effects of changes in the variances of the Gaussian distribution, thereby significantly enhancing the model's robustness. Also, UAdapterGNN can further improve the generalization ability of the model on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and high generalization ability of the proposed UAdapterGNN method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u9002\u914d\u5668UAdapterGNN\uff0c\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GNN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AdapterGNN\u6613\u53d7\u56fe\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u589e\u5f3aGNN\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u96c6\u6210\u5230GNN\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51faUAdapterGNN\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6982\u7387\u9002\u914d\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GNN\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u56fe\u5305\u542b\u5404\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\uff0cUAdapterGNN\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u5438\u6536\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u65b9\u5dee\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86UAdapterGNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy.

While previous work on SLM design has primarily focused on reducing the number of parameters to achieve parameter-optimal SLMs, parameter efficiency does not necessarily translate into proportional real-device speed-ups. This work aims to identify the key determinants of SLMs' real-device latency and offer generalizable principles and methodologies for SLM design and training when real-device latency is the primary consideration. Specifically, we identify two central architectural factors: depth-width ratios and operator choices. The former is crucial for small-batch-size latency, while the latter affects both latency and large-batch-size throughput. In light of this, we first study latency-optimal depth-width ratios, with the key finding that although deep-thin models generally achieve better accuracy under the same parameter budget, they may not lie on the accuracy-latency trade-off frontier. Next, we explore emerging efficient attention alternatives to evaluate their potential as candidate building operators. Using the identified promising operators, we construct an evolutionary search framework to automatically discover latency-optimal combinations of these operators within hybrid SLMs, thereby advancing the accuracy-latency frontier. In addition to architectural improvements, we further enhance SLM training using a weight normalization technique that enables more effective weight updates and improves final convergence. Combining these methods, we introduce a new family of hybrid SLMs, called Nemotron-Flash, which significantly advances the accuracy-efficiency frontier of state-of-the-art SLMs, e.g., achieving over +5.5% average accuracy, 1.3x/1.9x lower latency, and 18.7x/45.6x higher throughput compared to Qwen3-1.7B/0.6B, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u771f\u5b9e\u8bbe\u5907\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u67b6\u6784\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efaNemotron - Flash\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80SLM\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u771f\u5b9e\u8bbe\u5907\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u5f71\u54cdSLMs\u771f\u5b9e\u8bbe\u5907\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u539f\u5219\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u786e\u5b9a\u6df1\u5ea6 - \u5bbd\u5ea6\u6bd4\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u9009\u62e9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u67b6\u6784\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6 - \u5bbd\u5ea6\u6bd4\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u5b50\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408SLMs\u5bb6\u65cfNemotron - Flash\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4Qwen3 - 1.7B/0.6B\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d855.5%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e1.3x/1.9x\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad818.7x/45.6x\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u67b6\u6784\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SLMs\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387 - \u6548\u7387\u524d\u6cbf\u3002"}}

However, they suffer from a critical \\emph{gradient vanishing} problem when all responses within a group receive identical rewards, causing advantage estimates to collapse and training signals to diminish. Existing attempts to mitigate this issue fall into two paradigms: filtering-based and sampling-based methods. Filtering-based methods first generate rollouts broadly and then retroactively filter out uninformative groups, leading to substantial computational overhead. Sampling-based methods proactively select effective samples before rollout but rely on static criteria or prior dataset knowledge, lacking real-time adaptability. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{VADE}, a \\textbf{V}ariance-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{D}ynamic sampling framework via online sample-level difficulty \\textbf{E}stimation. Our framework integrates three key components: online sample-level difficulty estimation using Beta distributions, a Thompson sampler that maximizes information gain through the estimated correctness probability, and a two-scale prior decay mechanism that maintains robust estimation under policy evolution. This three components design enables VADE to dynamically select the most informative samples, thereby amplifying training signals while eliminating extra rollout costs. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that VADE consistently outperforms strong baselines in both performance and sample efficiency, while achieving a dramatic reduction in computational overhead.

A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric. However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies. This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule. We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement.

Different from the assessment of text-driven image generation, text-driven image editing is characterized by simultaneously conditioning on both text and a source image. The edited images often retain an intrinsic connection to the original image, which dynamically change with the semantics of the text. However, previous methods tend to solely focus on text-image alignment or have not well aligned with human perception. In this work, we introduce the Text-driven Image Editing Benchmark suite (IE-Bench) to enhance the assessment of text-driven edited images. IE-Bench includes a database contains diverse source images, various editing prompts and the corresponding edited results from different editing methods, and nearly 4,000 samples with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) provided by 15 human subjects.

Existing compression techniques like token eviction, quantization, or other low-rank methods often risk information loss, have fixed limits, or introduce significant computational overhead from explicit decompression steps. In this work, we introduce SWAN, a novel, fine-tuning-free framework that eliminates this overhead. Our method uses an offline orthogonal matrix to rotate and prune the KV-cache, which is then used directly in the attention computation without any reconstruction. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAN, augmented with a small dense buffer, offers a robust trade-off, maintaining performance close to the uncompressed baseline even at aggressive 50-60% memory savings per-token on KV-cache. A key advantage is its runtime-tunable compression level, allowing operators to dynamically adjust the memory footprint, a flexibility absent in methods requiring fixed offline configurations. This combination of a decompression-free design, high performance under compression, and adaptability makes SWAN a practical and efficient solution for serving LLMs with long contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSWAN\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u4fee\u526aKV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\u53ef\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u65f6KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3001\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u9650\u5236\u6216\u89e3\u538b\u7f29\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u4fee\u526aKV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "SWAN\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\u5728KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6bcf\u4ee4\u724c\u8282\u770150 - 60%\u5185\u5b58\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u672a\u538b\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\u53ef\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "conclusion": "SWAN\u65e0\u5206\u89e3\u538b\u7f29\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u662f\u670d\u52a1\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Leveraging generative modeling, StableUASim produces diverse and statistically realistic channel realizations, while supporting conditional generation from specific measurement samples. Pre-training enables rapid adaptation to new environments using minimal additional data, and the autoencoder latent representation facilitates efficient channel analysis and compression.

Since any MI estimator is a function of the observed sample from two random variables, we parameterize this function with a neural network (MIST) and train it end-to-end to predict MI values. Training is performed on a large meta-dataset of 625,000 synthetic joint distributions with known ground-truth MI. To handle variable sample sizes and dimensions, we employ a two-dimensional attention scheme ensuring permutation invariance across input samples. To quantify uncertainty, we optimize a quantile regression loss, enabling the estimator to approximate the sampling distribution of MI rather than return a single point estimate. This research program departs from prior work by taking a fully empirical route, trading universal theoretical guarantees for flexibility and efficiency. Empirically, the learned estimators largely outperform classical baselines across sample sizes and dimensions, including on joint distributions unseen during training. The resulting quantile-based intervals are well-calibrated and more reliable than bootstrap-based confidence intervals, while inference is orders of magnitude faster than existing neural baselines. Beyond immediate empirical gains, this framework yields trainable, fully differentiable estimators that can be embedded into larger learning pipelines.

However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN.

While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models. To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines.

Unlike humans who naturally bridge details and high-level concepts, models tend to treat these elements in isolation. Prevailing evaluation protocols often decouple low-level perception from high-level reasoning, overlooking their semantic and causal dependencies, which yields non-diagnostic results and obscures performance bottlenecks. We present VCU-Bridge, a framework that operationalizes a human-like hierarchy of visual connotation understanding: multi-level reasoning that advances from foundational perception through semantic bridging to abstract connotation, with an explicit evidence-to-inference trace from concrete cues to abstract conclusions. Building on this framework, we construct HVCU-Bench, a benchmark for hierarchical visual connotation understanding with explicit, level-wise diagnostics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate a consistent decline in performance as reasoning progresses to higher levels. We further develop a data generation pipeline for instruction tuning guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and show that strengthening low-level capabilities yields measurable gains at higher levels. Interestingly, it not only improves on HVCU-Bench but also brings benefits on general benchmarks (average +2.53%), especially with substantial gains on MMStar (+7.26%), demonstrating the significance of the hierarchical thinking pattern and its effectiveness in enhancing MLLM capabilities.

Reliable connectivity remains a critical yet challenging task due to three-dimensional (3D) mobility, time-varying user density, and limited power budgets. The transmit power of base stations (BSs) fluctuates dynamically according to user locations and traffic demands, leading to a highly non-stationary 3D radio environment. Radio maps (RMs) have emerged as an effective means to characterize spatial power distributions and support radio-aware network optimization. However, most existing works construct static or offline RMs, overlooking real-time power variations and spatio-temporal dependencies in multi-UAV networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a {3D dynamic radio map (3D-DRM)} framework that learns and predicts the spatio-temporal evolution of received power. Specially, a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder extracts high-dimensional spatial representations from 3D RMs, while a Transformer-based module models sequential dependencies to predict future power distributions.

Specifically, we observe that the router's expert selection scores implicitly encode a quality-aware ranking of responses (i.e. higher-scoring experts consistently generate higher-quality outputs). Building on this insight, OrdMoE constructs an internal preference hierarchy by grouping experts into ranked tiers based on their per-token routing scores and activating each tier separately to produce a sequence of responses with increasing quality. This yields a zero-cost, self-supervised preference ordering over generated responses, which can be directly optimized using standard preference learning objectives.

Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \\textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \\textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR. In each stage, UnfoldLDM employs a multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module as the gradient descent step. MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks.

We term this phenomenon heterogeneity amplification. Our work provides a theoretical analysis that maps AFL design choices to their resulting error sources when heterogeneity amplification occurs. Guided by our analysis, we propose ACE (All-Client Engagement AFL), which mitigates participation imbalance through immediate, non-buffered updates that use the latest information available from all clients.

However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness.

Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-256, we uncover two key phenomena: ({i}) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic quality, indicating that semantically richer samples require greater kinetic effort, and ({ii}) higher KPE inversely correlates with data density, with informative samples residing in sparse, low-density regions. Together, these findings reveal that semantically informative samples naturally reside on the sparse frontier of the data distribution, demanding greater generative effort.

We present a hybrid sequence model that combines multi-scale temporal convolutions, a gated recurrent module, and time-aware self-attention. The model is trained with standard regression losses and evaluated under MAE, RMSE, sMAPE, MASE, and Theil's U_2 with strict time-based splits to prevent leakage. We benchmark against ARIMA/Prophet, LSTM/GRU, LightGBM, and state-of-the-art Transformer forecasters (TFT, Informer, Autoformer, N-BEATS). Results show consistent accuracy gains and improved robustness on peak/holiday periods. We further provide ablations and statistical significance tests to ensure the reliability of improvements, and we release implementation details to facilitate reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528UCI Online Retail II\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7535\u5546\u4ea4\u6613\u591a\u6c34\u5e73\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u878d\u79d1\u6280\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u501f\u8d37\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u96f6\u552e\u5e02\u573a\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6c34\u5e73\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u56de\u5f52\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5cf0/\u5047\u671f\u65f6\u6bb5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u786e\u4fdd\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u516c\u5e03\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u65b9\u4fbf\u590d\u73b0\u3002"}}

Due to the extreme environmental conditions, unprecedented data volumes, and the sheer scale and complexity of the detectors, DQM orchestration has become a very challenging task. Therefore, the use of Machine Learning (ML) to automate anomaly detection, improve efficiency, and reduce human error in the process of collecting high-quality data is unavoidable. Since DQM relies on real experimental data, it is inherently tied to the specific detector substructure and technology in operation. In this work, a simulation-driven approach to DQM is proposed, enabling the study and development of data-quality methodologies in a controlled environment. Using a modified version of Delphes -- a fast, multi-purpose detector simulation -- the preliminary realization of a framework is demonstrated which leverages ML to identify detector anomalies as well as localize the malfunctioning components responsible. We introduce MEDIC (Monitoring for Event Data Integrity and Consistency), a neural network designed to learn detector behavior and perform DQM tasks to look for potential faults. Although the present implementation adopts a simplified setup for computational ease, where large detector regions are deliberately deactivated to mimic faults, this work represents an initial step toward a comprehensive ML-based DQM framework. The encouraging results underline the potential of simulation-driven studies as a foundation for developing more advanced, data-driven DQM systems for future particle detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u76d1\u6d4b\uff08DQM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Delphes\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcMEDIC\u5b9e\u73b0\u521d\u6b65\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2dDQM\u7f16\u6392\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u7684DQM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Delphes\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcMEDIC\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u6267\u884cDQM\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee4\u4eba\u9f13\u821e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7c92\u5b50\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684DQM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This is particularly problematic in resource-constrained and remote environments where bandwidth is limited, and battery-dependent devices further emphasize the problem. Moreover, in domains such as agriculture, consecutive sensor readings often have minimal variation, making continuous data transmission inefficient and unnecessarily resource intensive. To overcome these challenges, we propose an analytical prediction algorithm designed for edge computing environments and validated through simulation. The proposed solution utilizes a predictive filter at the network edge that forecasts the next sensor data point and triggers data transmission only when the deviation from the predicted value exceeds a predefined tolerance. A complementary cloud-based model ensures data integrity and overall system consistency. This dual-model strategy effectively reduces communication overhead and demonstrates potential for improving energy efficiency by minimizing redundant transmissions. In addition to reducing communication load, our approach leverages both in situ and satellite observations from the same locations to enhance model robustness. It also supports cross-site generalization, enabling models trained in one region to be effectively deployed elsewhere without retraining. This makes our solution highly scalable, energy-aware, and well-suited for optimizing sensor data transmission in remote and bandwidth-constrained IoT environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5206\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8fdc\u7a0b\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f51\u7edc\u62e5\u585e\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4e14\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u8fb9\u7f18\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e91\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u539f\u4f4d\u548c\u536b\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u7ad9\u70b9\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u8282\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8fdc\u7a0b\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u3002"}}

The CIL was empirically demonstrated through the practice-led creation of two graphic novellas, investigating how AI could serve as an effective creative colleague within a subjective medium lacking objective metrics. The process required navigating multifaceted challenges including AI's 'jagged frontier' of capabilities, sycophancy, and attention-scarce feedback environments. This prompted iterative refinement of teaming practices, yielding emergent strategies: a multi-faceted critique system integrating adversarial AI roles to counter sycophancy, and prioritizing 'feedback-ready' concrete artifacts to elicit essential human critique. The resulting graphic novellas analyze distinct socio-technical governance failures: 'The Steward' examines benevolent AI paternalism in smart cities, illustrating how algorithmic hubris can erode freedom; 'Fork the Vote' probes democratic legitimacy by comparing centralized AI opacity with emergent collusion in federated networks.

Submitted to arXiv", "summary": "Accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction coupled with uncertainty quantification remains a critical challenge in aerospace prognostics. This research introduces a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that learns aleatoric uncertainty directly through probabilistic modeling, an approach unexplored in existing CMAPSS-based literature. Our hierarchical architecture integrates multi-scale Inception blocks for temporal pattern extraction, bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequential modeling, and a dual-level attention mechanism operating simultaneously on sensor and temporal dimensions. The innovation lies in the Bayesian output layer that predicts both mean RUL and variance, enabling the model to learn data-inherent uncertainty. Comprehensive preprocessing employs condition-aware clustering, wavelet denoising, and intelligent feature selection. Experimental validation on NASA CMAPSS benchmarks (FD001-FD004) demonstrates competitive overall performance with RMSE values of 16.22, 19.29, 16.84, and 19.98 respectively.

However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA.

In this work, we propose a novel UAP attack against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS under the domain-specific constraints derived from network data rules and feature relationships.

In addition, this is the first work that focuses on developing a UAP against a DRL-based IDS under realistic domain constraints based on not only the basic domain rules but also mathematical relations between the features. Furthermore, we enhance the evasion performance of the proposed UAP, by introducing a customized loss function based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and we denote it as Customized UAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work using the PCC value in the UAP generation, even in the broader context. Four additional established UAP baselines are implemented for a comprehensive comparison.

Extensive experiments on both public and proprietary datasets, on both offline scenarios and online deployed A/B Testing, demonstrate that RAVEN++ outperforms general-purpose LLMs and specialized models like RAVEN in terms of fine-grained violation understanding, reasoning capabilities, and generalization ability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRAVEN++\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u5e7f\u544a\u5ba1\u6838\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548cRAVEN\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u5e7f\u544a\u5ba1\u6838\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRAVEN++\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fdd\u89c4\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u79bb\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRAVEN++\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fdd\u89c4\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548cRAVEN\u3002", "conclusion": "RAVEN++\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5e7f\u544a\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this, we develop a Priority Score integrating untested children proportions, elevated blood lead prevalence, and public health coverage patterns to support optimized resource allocation decisions across 136 neighborhoods in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. We leverage these allocation tasks, which require integrating multiple vulnerability indicators and interpreting empirical evidence, to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) with agentic reasoning and deep research capabilities can effectively allocate public health resources when presented with structured allocation scenarios. LLMs were tasked with distributing 1,000 test kits within each city based on neighborhood vulnerability indicators. Results reveal significant limitations: LLMs frequently overlooked neighborhoods with highest lead prevalence and largest proportions of untested children, such as West Englewood in Chicago, while allocating disproportionate resources to lower-priority areas like Hunts Point in New York City. Overall accuracy averaged 0.46, reaching a maximum of 0.66 with ChatGPT 5 Deep Research.

To address this limitation, this paper introduces and evaluates FDSW-UCB, a novel dual-view algorithm that integrates a discount-based long-term perspective with a sliding-window-based short-term view. A data-driven semi-synthetic simulation platform, built upon the MovieLens-1M and Open Bandit datasets, is developed to test algorithm adaptability under abrupt and gradual drift scenarios.

Preliminary version; extended experiments and analysis forthcoming", "summary": "Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces two major design bottlenecks: crafting dense reward functions and constructing curricula that avoid local optima in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments. Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline.

However, digital interventions are typically programmed as software before clinical encounters as libraries of parametrized exercise modules targeting broad patient populations. At the point of care, clinicians can only select modules and adjust a narrow set of parameters like repetitions, so patient specific needs that emerge during encounters, such as distinct movement limitations, and home environments, are rarely reflected in the software. We evaluated a digital intervention paradigm that uses large language models (LLMs) to translate clinicians' exercise prescriptions into intervention software. In a prospective single arm feasibility study with 20 licensed physical and occupational therapists and a standardized patient, clinicians created 40 individualized upper extremity programs (398 instructions) that were automatically translated into executable software. Our results show a 45% increase in the proportion of personalized prescriptions that can be implemented as software compared with a template based benchmark, with unanimous consensus among therapists on ease of use. The LLM generated software correctly delivered 99.78% (397/398) of instructions as prescribed and monitored performance with 88.4% (352/398) accuracy, with 90% (18/20) of therapists judged it safe to interact with patients, and 75% (15/20) expressed willingness to adopt it.

Distilled DMs are faster but typically remain confined within their teacher's domain. Thus, fast and high-quality generation for novel domains relies on two-stage training pipelines: Adapt-then-Distill or Distill-then-Adapt. However, both add design complexity and suffer from degraded quality or diversity. We introduce Uni-DAD, a single-stage pipeline that unifies distillation and adaptation of DMs. It couples two signals during training: (i) a dual-domain distribution-matching distillation objective that guides the student toward the distributions of the source teacher and a target teacher, and (ii) a multi-head generative adversarial network (GAN) loss that encourages target realism across multiple feature scales. The source domain distillation preserves diverse source knowledge, while the multi-head GAN stabilizes training and reduces overfitting, especially in few-shot regimes. The inclusion of a target teacher facilitates adaptation to more structurally distant domains. We perform evaluations on a variety of datasets for few-shot image generation (FSIG) and subject-driven personalization (SDP).

However, their performance as multi-scale devices is determined by complex interactions between their constituent layers. This creates a vast combinatorial space of possible materials and device architectures, making the conventional experimental-based screening process slow and expensive. Machine learning models try to address this problem, but they only focus on individual material properties or neglect the important geometric information of the perovskite crystal. To address this problem, we propose to predict perovskite solar cell power conversion efficiency with a geometric-aware co-attention (Solar-GECO) model. Solar-GECO combines a geometric graph neural network (GNN) - that directly encodes the atomic structure of the perovskite absorber - with language model embeddings that process the textual strings representing the chemical compounds of the transport layers and other device components. Solar-GECO also integrates a co-attention module to capture intra-layer dependencies and inter-layer interactions, while a probabilistic regression head predicts both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and its associated uncertainty. Solar-GECO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming several baselines, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) for PCE prediction from 3.066 to 2.936 compared to semantic GNN (the previous state-of-the-art model).

Existing methods either prioritize speed and produce low-quality results, or achieve high-quality reconstruction at the cost of slow inference times. In this paper, we propose SwiftVGGT, a training-free method that significantly reduce inference time while preserving high-quality dense 3D reconstruction. To maintain global consistency in large-scale scenes, SwiftVGGT performs loop closure without relying on the external Visual Place Recognition (VPR) model. This removes redundant computation and enables accurate reconstruction over kilometer-scale environments. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective point sampling method to align neighboring chunks using a single Sim(3)-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) step. This eliminates the need for the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimization commonly used in prior work, leading to substantial speed-ups.

With the growing presence of AI in society, it becomes increasingly important to develop methods that can explain and interpret the decisions made by these systems.

MI is the process of studying the inner computations of neural networks and translating them into human-understandable algorithms. It encompasses reverse engineering techniques aimed at uncovering the computational algorithms implemented by neural networks. In this article, we propose a unified taxonomy of MI approaches and provide a detailed analysis of key techniques, illustrated with concrete examples and pseudo-code. We contextualize MI within the broader interpretability landscape, comparing its goals, methods, and insights to other strands of XAI. Additionally, we trace the development of MI as a research area, highlighting its conceptual roots and the accelerating pace of recent work.

While recent approaches involving GAN, transformer and diffusion-based models have made progress, they often struggle to capture the full spectrum of writer-specific attributes, particularly global stylistic patterns that span long-range spatial dependencies. As a result, capturing subtle writer-specific traits such as consistent slant, curvature or stroke pressure, while keeping the generated text accurate is still an open problem. In this work, we present a unified framework designed to address these limitations. We introduce a Vision Transformer-based style encoder that learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, allowing the model to better represent long-range structural characteristics of handwriting. We then integrate these style cues with the target text using a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the system to produce handwritten images that more faithfully reflect the intended style. To make the process more interpretable, we utilize Salient Stroke Attention Analysis (SSAA), which reveals the stroke-level features the model focuses on during style transfer.

The proposed STGNN predicts log-differenced sales and reconstructs final values through a residual path, enabling stable training and improved generalisation.

To bridge this gap, we first introduce OmniStruct, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities on diverse text-to-structure tasks such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. We build OmniStruct by identifying existing datasets across a wide range of tasks that are suitable for a structured answer format, and adapting them under a unified text-to-structure problem setting.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding.

However, existing INR frameworks -- including MLPs with Fourier features, SIREN, and multiresolution hash grids -- implicitly assume a \\textit{global and stationary} spectral basis. This assumption is fundamentally misaligned with real-world signals whose frequency characteristics vary significantly across space, exhibiting local high-frequency textures, smooth regions, and frequency drift phenomena. We propose \\textbf{Neural Spectral Transport Representation (NSTR)}, the first INR framework that \\textbf{explicitly models a spatially varying local frequency field}. NSTR introduces a learnable \\emph{frequency transport equation}, a PDE that governs how local spectral compositions evolve across space. Given a learnable local spectrum field $S(x)$ and a frequency transport network $F_\u03b8$ enforcing $\\nabla S(x) \\approx F_\u03b8(x, S(x))$, NSTR reconstructs signals by spatially modulating a compact set of global sinusoidal bases. This formulation enables strong local adaptivity and offers a new level of interpretability via visualizing frequency flows. Experiments on 2D image regression, audio reconstruction, and implicit 3D geometry show that NSTR achieves significantly better accuracy-parameter trade-offs than SIREN, Fourier-feature MLPs, and Instant-NGP. NSTR requires fewer global frequencies, converges faster, and naturally explains signal structure through spectral transport fields.

These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences.

Traditional methods rely on visual modality, often struggling with complex threats. While recent studies incorporate language to guide single-view images, human inspectors typically use dual-view images in practice. This raises the question: can the second view provide constraints similar to a language modality? In this work, we introduce DualXrayBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for X-ray inspection that includes multiple views and modalities. It supports eight tasks designed to test cross-view reasoning. In DualXrayBench, we introduce a caption corpus consisting of 45,613 dual-view image pairs across 12 categories with corresponding captions. Building upon these data, we propose the Geometric (cross-view)-Semantic (cross-modality) Reasoner (GSR), a multimodal model that jointly learns correspondences between cross-view geometry and cross-modal semantics, treating the second-view images as a \"language-like modality\". To enable this, we construct the GSXray dataset, with structured Chain-of-Thought sequences: <top>, <side>, <conclusion>.

By factorizing each task into interpretable events, we show that the model acquires capabilities in discrete stages, first learning the coarse grained rules, before learning the complete latent structure. We also identify a crucial asymmetry, where the model can compose fundamental rules robustly, but struggles to decompose complex examples to discover the fundamental rules.

Adversarial attacks have been deeply investigated in the image domain; however, there is less research in the time-series domain and very little for forecasting financial data. To address these concerns, this study aims to build upon previous research on adversarial attacks for time-series data by introducing two new slope-based methods aimed to alter the trends of the predicted stock forecast generated by an N-HiTS model. Compared to the normal N-HiTS predictions, the two new slope-based methods, the General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack, can manipulate N-HiTS predictions by doubling the slope. These new slope attacks can bypass standard security mechanisms, such as a discriminator that filters real and perturbed inputs, reducing a 4-layered CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%. Furthermore, the slope based methods were incorporated into a GAN architecture as a means of generating realistic synthetic data, while simultaneously fooling the model.

The shared task features two tracks: circuit localization, which assesses methods that identify causally influential components and interactions driving model behavior, and causal variable localization, which evaluates approaches that map activations into interpretable features. With three teams spanning eight different methods, participants achieved notable gains in circuit localization using ensemble and regularization strategies for circuit discovery.

In real-world scenarios, however, data often arrives sequentially and without annotations, rendering conventional approaches impractical. In this work, we revisit the fundamental assumptions of continual learning and ask: Can current systems adapt when labels are absent and tasks emerge incrementally over time? To this end, we introduce Annotation-Free Class-Incremental Learning (AFCIL), a more realistic and challenging paradigm where unlabeled data arrives continuously, and the learner must incrementally acquire new classes without any supervision. To enable effective learning under AFCIL, we propose CrossWorld CL, a Cross Domain World Guided Continual Learning framework that incorporates external world knowledge as a stable auxiliary source.

This sampling approach enables our estimator to efficiently scale to large datasets without sacrificing reliability. To support intrinsic evaluation of cluster quality without ground-truth labels, we propose the Cohesion Ratio, a simple and interpretable evaluation metric that quantifies how much intra-cluster similarity exceeds the global similarity background.

Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models.

Instead of predicting a single class, CP generates a prediction set, guaranteed to include the true label with a pre-specified probability. The performance of different CP methods is typically assessed by their average prediction set size. In setups where the classes can be partitioned into semantic groups, e.g., diseases that require similar treatment, users can benefit from prediction sets that are not only small on average, but also contain a small number of semantically different groups. This paper begins by addressing this problem and ultimately offers a widely applicable tool for boosting any CP method on any dataset. First, given a class partition, we propose augmenting the CP score function with a term that penalizes predictions with out-of-group errors. We theoretically analyze this strategy and prove its advantages for group-related metrics. Surprisingly, we show mathematically that, for common class partitions, it can also reduce the average set size of any CP score function. Our analysis reveals the class similarity factors behind this improvement and motivates us to propose a model-specific variant, which does not require any human semantic partition and can further reduce the prediction set size.

To fill this gap, we introduce DocPTBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for Photographed Document Parsing and Translation. DocPTBench comprises over 1,300 high-resolution photographed documents from multiple domains, includes eight translation scenarios, and provides meticulously human-verified annotations for both parsing and translation. Our experiments demonstrate that transitioning from digital-born to photographed documents results in a substantial performance decline: popular MLLMs exhibit an average accuracy drop of 18% in end-to-end parsing and 12% in translation, while specialized document parsing models show significant average decrease of 25%. This substantial performance gap underscores the unique challenges posed by documents captured in real-world conditions and reveals the limited robustness of existing models.

In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach.

However, current manual grading processes are not only time-consuming but also limited by significant inter-observer variability and efficiency bottlenecks. Although deep learning has demonstrated potential in automated grading in recent years, existing solutions face a significant challenge: pure regression models lack the visual explainability required for clinical practice, while pure segmentation models struggle to directly translate pixel-level masks into precise clinical grades. This study proposes RegDeepLab, a dual-branch Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework that integrates State-of-the-Art (SOTA) semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3+) with a multi-scale regression head. Addressing the common issues of \"Gradient Conflict\" and \"Negative Transfer\" in multi-task training, we propose a \"Two-Stage Decoupled Training Strategy.\" Experimental results demonstrate that while standard end-to-end MTL training can minimize grading error (MAE=0.046) through our designed \"Feature Injection\" mechanism, it compromises the integrity of segmentation boundaries. In contrast, our decoupled strategy successfully provides robust and high-precision grading predictions while preserving SOTA-level segmentation accuracy (Dice=0.729). Furthermore, we introduce a \"Range Loss\" to effectively utilize large-scale discrete grading data for semi-supervised learning.

Moreover, a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module adaptively balances each agent's learning from both expert-generated and agent-generated trajectories, accelerating policy convergence and improving generalization.

This study presents a rigorous comparative analysis of DDPMs against the emerging Flow Matching (Rectified Flow) paradigm, specifically isolating their geometric and efficiency properties on low-resource hardware. By implementing both frameworks on a shared Time-Conditioned U-Net backbone using the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that Flow Matching significantly outperforms Diffusion in efficiency. Our geometric analysis reveals that Flow Matching learns a highly rectified transport path (Curvature $\\mathcal{C} \\approx 1.02$), which is near-optimal, whereas Diffusion trajectories remain stochastic and tortuous ($\\mathcal{C} \\approx 3.45$). Furthermore, we establish an ``efficiency frontier'' at $N=10$ function evaluations, where Flow Matching retains high fidelity while Diffusion collapses. Finally, we show via numerical sensitivity analysis that the learned vector field is sufficiently linear to render high-order ODE solvers (Runge-Kutta 4) unnecessary, validating the use of lightweight Euler solvers for edge deployment. \\textbf{This work concludes that Flow Matching is the superior algorithmic choice for real-time, resource-constrained generative tasks.}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4DDPM\u548cFlow Matching\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Flow Matching\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eDDPM\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "DDPM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u4e0e\u65b0\u5174\u7684Flow Matching\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7684Time - Conditioned U - Net\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6548\u7387\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6570\u503c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "Flow Matching\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eDiffusion\uff1bFlow Matching\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u800cDiffusion\u8f68\u8ff9\u968f\u673a\u66f2\u6298\uff1b\u5728N = 10\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\uff0cFlow Matching\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0cDiffusion\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u8db3\u591f\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Euler\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9002\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "Flow Matching\u662f\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u66f4\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

TTS systems usually depend on reference audio for timbre, offer only limited text-level attribute control, and rarely support dialogue generation. TTM systems are constrained by input conditioning requirements that depend on expert knowledge annotations. The high heterogeneity of these input control conditions makes them difficult to joint modeling with speech synthesis. Despite sharing common acoustic modeling characteristics, these two tasks have long been developed independently, leaving open the challenge of achieving unified modeling through natural language instructions. We introduce InstructAudio, a unified framework that enables instruction-based (natural language descriptions) control of acoustic attributes including timbre (gender, age), paralinguistic (emotion, style, accent), and musical (genre, instrument, rhythm, atmosphere). It supports expressive speech, music, and dialogue generation in English and Chinese. The model employs joint and single diffusion transformer layers with a standardized instruction-phoneme input format, trained on 50K hours of speech and 20K hours of music data, enabling multi-task learning and cross-modal alignment. Fig. 1 visualizes performance comparisons with mainstream TTS and TTM models, demonstrating that InstructAudio achieves optimal results on most metrics. To our best knowledge, InstructAudio represents the first instruction-controlled framework unifying speech and music generation.

These multi-agent interactions pose a fundamental challenge, particularly in social dilemmas, where agents' individual incentives can undermine collective welfare. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for aligning large language models (LLMs) in the single-agent regime, prior small-network results suggest that standard RL in multi-agent settings often converges to defecting, self-interested policies. We show the same effect in LLMs: despite cooperative priors, RL-trained LLM agents develop opportunistic behavior that can exploit even advanced closed-source models. To address this tendency of RL to converge to poor equilibria, we adapt a recent opponent-learning awareness algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to fine-tune LLMs toward multi-agent cooperation and non-exploitability. We then introduce a group-relative baseline that simplifies advantage computation in iterated games, enabling multi-agent training at LLM scale. We also contribute a novel social dilemma environment, Trust and Split, which requires natural language communication to achieve high collective welfare.

A core obstacle to the creation of better systems is the scarcity of benchmarks that capture the complexity of real therapeutic interactions. Most existing benchmarks either only test clinical knowledge through multiple-choice questions or assess single responses in isolation. To bridge this gap, we present MindEval, a framework designed in collaboration with Ph.D-level Licensed Clinical Psychologists for automatically evaluating language models in realistic, multi-turn mental health therapy conversations. Through patient simulation and automatic evaluation with LLMs, our framework balances resistance to gaming with reproducibility via its fully automated, model-agnostic design. We begin by quantitatively validating the realism of our simulated patients against human-generated text and by demonstrating strong correlations between automatic and human expert judgments.

However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

Existing CNN-Transformer hybrids rely on static computation graphs with fixed routing, which consequently causes redundant computation and limits their adaptability to input variability. We propose Shape-Adapting Gated Experts (SAGE), an input-adaptive framework that enables dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual networks. SAGE reconfigures static backbones into dynamically routed expert architectures. SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules. Embodied as SAGE-UNet, our model achieves superior segmentation on three medical benchmarks: EBHI, DigestPath, and GlaS, yielding state-of-the-art Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, respectively, and robustly generalizes across domains by adaptively balancing local refinement and global context.

To accelerate this, flow maps can be distilled from pre-trained teachers, a procedure that conventionally requires sampling from an external dataset. We argue that this data-dependency introduces a fundamental risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch, as a static dataset may provide an incomplete or even misaligned representation of the teacher's full generative capabilities. This leads us to question whether this reliance on data is truly necessary for successful flow map distillation. In this work, we explore a data-free alternative that samples only from the prior distribution, a distribution the teacher is guaranteed to follow by construction, thereby circumventing the mismatch risk entirely. To demonstrate the practical viability of this philosophy, we introduce a principled framework that learns to predict the teacher's sampling path while actively correcting for its own compounding errors to ensure high fidelity. Our approach surpasses all data-based counterparts and establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin. Specifically, distilling from SiT-XL/2+REPA, our method reaches an impressive FID of 1.45 on ImageNet 256x256, and 1.49 on ImageNet 512x512, both with only 1 sampling step.

MLLMs deployed on devices have to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks, such as variations in background and perspective, to effectively perform complex visual tasks. To this end, we construct a multimodal visual understanding dataset (MSVQA) encompassing four different scenarios and perspectives including high altitude, underwater, low altitude and indoor, to investigate the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under the dynamics of scenario shifts in real-world data streams. Furthermore, we propose mUltimodal coNtInual learning with MLLMs From multi-scenarIo pERspectives (UNIFIER) to address visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios.

Existing methodologies typically treat molecular captioning (molecule-to-text) and text-based molecular design (text-to-molecule) as separate tasks, relying on supervised fine-tuning or contrastive learning pipelines. These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora.

Having poor P2P connectivity reduces the financial rewards from the mining consensus protocol. Previous research defines beneficalness of each Bitcoin peer connection and estimates the beneficialness based on the observations of the blocks and transactions delivery, which are after they are delivered. However, due to the infrequent block arrivals and the sporadic and unstable peer connections, the peers do not stay connected long enough to have the beneficialness score to converge to its expected beneficialness. We design and build Dynamic Peer Beneficialness Prediction (DyPBP) which predicts a peer's beneficialness by using networking behavior observations beyond just the block and transaction arrivals. DyPBP advances the previous research by estimating the beneficialness of a peer connection before it delivers new blocks and transactions. To achieve such goal, DyPBP introduces a new feature for remembrance to address the dynamic connectivity issue, as Bitcoin's peers using distributed networking often disconnect and re-connect. We implement DyPBP on an active Bitcoin node connected to the Mainnet and use machine learning for the beneficialness prediction. Our experimental results validate and evaluate the effectiveness of DyPBP; for example, the error performance improves by 2 to 13 orders of magnitude depending on the machine-learning model selection.

We present the first stage-specific, cross-sectional benchmarking of deep learning models for follow-up MRI using the Burdenko GBM Progression cohort (n = 180). We analyze different post-RT scans independently to test whether architecture performance depends on time-point. Eleven representative DL families (CNNs, LSTMs, hybrids, transformers, and selective state-space models) were trained under a unified, QC-driven pipeline with patient-level cross-validation. Across both stages, accuracies were comparable (~0.70-0.74), but discrimination improved at the second follow-up, with F1 and AUC increasing for several models, indicating richer separability later in the care pathway. A Mamba+CNN hybrid consistently offered the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while transformer variants delivered competitive AUCs at substantially higher computational cost and lightweight CNNs were efficient but less reliable.

We categorize constraints as conservative or aggressive and provide insights into their search behavior, focusing specifically on vanilla Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Conflict-Based Search with Priorities (CBSw/P). Under a hybrid grid-roadmap representation with varying resolution, we observe that aggressive (priority constraint) formulations tend to solve more instances as agent count or resolution increases, whereas conservative (motion constraint) formulations yield stronger solution quality when both succeed. Findings are synthesized in a decision flowchart, aiding users in selecting suitable constraints.

However, effectively navigating the vast amount of news content from different newspapers and online news portals can be challenging. Newspaper headlines with sentiment analysis tell us what the news is about (e.g., politics, sports) and how the news makes us feel (positive, negative, neutral). This helps us quickly understand the emotional tone of the news. This research presents a state-of-the-art approach to Bangla news headline classification combined with sentiment analysis applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly the hybrid transfer learning model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM. We have explored a dataset called BAN-ABSA of 9014 news headlines, which is the first time that has been experimented with simultaneously in the headline and sentiment categorization in Bengali newspapers. Over this imbalanced dataset, we applied two experimental strategies: technique-1, where undersampling and oversampling are applied before splitting, and technique-2, where undersampling and oversampling are applied after splitting on the In technique-1 oversampling provided the strongest performance, both headline and sentiment, that is 78.57\\% and 73.43\\% respectively, while technique-2 delivered the highest result when trained directly on the original imbalanced dataset, both headline and sentiment, that is 81.37\\% and 64.46\\% respectively. The proposed model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM significantly outperforms all baseline models in classification tasks, and achieves new state-of-the-art results for Bangla news headline classification and sentiment analysis. These results demonstrate the importance of leveraging both the headline and sentiment datasets, and provide a strong baseline for Bangla text classification in low-resource.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528NLP\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408BERT - CNN - BiLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u62a5\u7eb8\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u65b0\u95fb\u5185\u5bb9\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u65b0\u95fb\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u8c03\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8fd0\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bBERT - CNN - BiLSTM\uff0c\u5bf99014\u6761\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898\u7684BAN - ABSA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7b56\u75651\u4e2d\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u6807\u9898\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a78.57%\u548c73.43%\uff1b\u7b56\u75652\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a81.37%\u548c64.46%\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5229\u7528\u6807\u9898\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

However, geolocation uncertainties (typically 5-15 m) propagate systematically through derived products, undermining forest profile estimates, including carbon stock assessments. Existing correction methods face critical limitations: waveform simulation approaches achieve meter-level accuracy but require high-resolution LiDAR data unavailable in most regions, while terrain-based methods employ deterministic grid searches that may overlook optimal solutions in continuous solution spaces. We present SALPA (Spaceborne LiDAR Point Adjustment), a multi-algorithm optimization framework integrating three optimization paradigms with five distance metrics. Operating exclusively with globally available digital elevation models and geoid data, SALPA explores continuous solution spaces through gradient-based, evolutionary, and swarm intelligence approaches.

Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e73\u9762\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u900f\u89c6\u7578\u53d8\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bGemini - 1.5 - pro\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u6863\u7578\u53d8\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u6821\u6b63\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u6587\u6863\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u900f\u89c6\u7578\u53d8\uff0c\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u6587\u6863\u56fe\u50cf\u5178\u578b\u7578\u53d8\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u7b49\u8170\u68af\u5f62\u53d8\u6362\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bc4\u4f30\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u6587\u6863\u63d0\u53d6\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b57\u7b26\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u6863\u7578\u53d8\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u65cb\u8f6c\u6821\u6b63\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u8be5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728OCR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We study four bias mitigation techniques applied across ten models from seven model families, and we explore racial, religious, profession- and gender-related biases. We measure the impact of debiasing on model coherence and stereotypical preference using the StereoSet benchmark. Our results consistently show that while targeted mitigation can sometimes reduce bias in the intended dimension, it frequently leads to unintended and often negative consequences in others, such as increasing model bias and decreasing general coherence.

Self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning can mitigate the data scarcity challenge to some extent. However, both of these paradigms are complex and require either hand-crafted pretexts or well-defined pseudo-labels. In contrast, data augmentation represents a relatively simple and straightforward approach to addressing data scarcity issues. It has led to significant improvements in image recognition tasks. However, the effectiveness of local image editing augmentation techniques in the context of segmentation has been less explored. We propose HSMix, a novel approach to local image editing data augmentation involving hard and soft mixing for medical semantic segmentation. In our approach, a hard-augmented image is created by combining homogeneous regions (superpixels) from two source images. A soft mixing method further adjusts the brightness of these composed regions with brightness mixing based on locally aggregated pixel-wise saliency coefficients. The ground-truth segmentation masks of the two source images undergo the same mixing operations to generate the associated masks for the augmented images. Our method fully exploits both the prior contour and saliency information, thus preserving local semantic information in the augmented images while enriching the augmentation space with more diversity. Our method is a plug-and-play solution that is model agnostic and applicable to a range of medical imaging modalities.

Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support.

ECOSAIC compresses n-dimensional feature space by optimizing specialization and orthogonality between domain-informed features. We employed two domain-informed categories: biogeochemical and hydrogeomorphological, that together integrate biological, physicochemical, hydrological and geomorphological, features, whose constraints on habitats have been recognized in ecology for a century. We applied the model to the Colombian Pacific Ocean and the results revealed 16 benthic habitats, expanding from mangroves to deep rocky areas up to 1000 m depth. The candidate habitats exhibited a strong correspondence between their environmental constraints, represented in latent space, and their expected species composition. This correspondence reflected meaningful ecological associations rather than purely statistical correlations, where the habitat's environmental offerings align semantically with the species' requirements. This approach could improve the management and conservation of benthic habitats, facilitating the development of functional maps that support marine planning, biodiversity conservation and fish stock assessment.

Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts. Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics. These \"one-shot\" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks.\n  We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process. By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair. The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates.\n  We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet).

This study investigates a fundamental problem in decentralized multi-agent navigation: routing loops, where vehicles without persistent obstacle memory become trapped in cycles of inefficient path recalculation. Through systematic simulation experiments involving 72 unique configurations across varying vehicle densities (15, 35, 55 vehicles) and obstacle frequencies (6, 20 obstacles), we demonstrate that memory-less reactive rerouting increases average travel time by up to 682% compared to baseline conditions. To address this, we introduce Object Memory Management (OMM), a lightweight mechanism enabling agents to retain and share knowledge of previously encountered obstacles. OMM operates by maintaining a distributed blacklist of blocked nodes, which each agent consults during Dijkstra-based path recalculation, effectively preventing redundant routing attempts. Our results show that OMM-enabled coordination reduces average travel time by 75.7% and wait time by 88% compared to memory-less systems, while requiring only 1.67 route recalculations per vehicle versus 9.83 in memory-less scenarios. This work provides empirical evidence that persistent, shared memory is not merely beneficial but essential for robust multi-agent coordination in dynamic environments.

This quantitative reasoning capability remains underexplored and poorly supported in existing VLMs. In this work, we introduce MedVision, a large-scale dataset and benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and improve VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis. MedVision spans 22 public datasets covering diverse anatomies and modalities, with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs.

Our benchmarks show that current off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these tasks. However, with supervised fine-tuning on MedVision, we significantly enhance their performance across detection, T/L estimation, and A/D measurement, demonstrating reduced error rates and improved precision.

Existing visual-CoT resources are typically small, domain-specific, or lack the human-like stepwise structure necessary for compositional visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisReason, a large-scale dataset designed to advance visual Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VisReason comprises 489K annotated examples spanning four diverse domains, each featuring multi-round, human-like rationales that guide MLLMs through interpretable visual reasoning steps. Building upon this, we curate VisReason-Pro, a 165K subset produced with a stronger expert-level GPT annotator, enriched with detailed reasoning traces and 3D spatial grounding via depth-informed annotations. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art Qwen2.5-VL model on VisReason and VisReason-Pro yields substantial improvements in step-by-step visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and cross-benchmark generalization.

In this work, the effect of different uncertainty estimation and calibration methods are evaluated for active learning when using ensembles of ALIGNN, eXtreme Gradient Boost, Random Forest, and Neural Network model architectures. We compare uncertainty estimates from ALIGNN deep ensembles to loss landscape uncertainty estimates obtained for solubility, bandgap, and formation energy prediction tasks. We then evaluate how the quality of the uncertainty estimate impacts an active learning campaign that seeks model generalization to out-of-distribution data. Uncertainty calibration methods were found to variably generalize from in-domain data to out-of-domain data. Furthermore, calibrated uncertainties were generally unsuccessful in reducing the amount of data required by a model to improve during an active learning campaign on out-of-distribution data when compared to random sampling and uncalibrated uncertainties. The impact of poor-quality uncertainty persists for random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models trained on the same data for the same tasks, indicating that this is at least partially intrinsic to the data and not due to model capacity alone.

To address these issues, we introduce ObjectAlign, a novel framework that seamlessly blends perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect, verify, and correct object-level and temporal inconsistencies in edited video sequences. The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed \"consistent\" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected. This enables reconstruction of the corrupted frames from the last valid and next valid keyframes.

The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features.

In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical \"City-District-Grid\" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a \"produce-refine-evaluate\" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout.

In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards.

We introduce RhinoInsight, a deep research framework that adds two control mechanisms to enhance robustness, traceability, and overall quality without parameter updates. First, a Verifiable Checklist module transforms user requirements into traceable and verifiable sub-goals, incorporates human or LLM critics for refinement, and compiles a hierarchical outline to anchor subsequent actions and prevent non-executable planning. Second, an Evidence Audit module structures search content, iteratively updates the outline, and prunes noisy context, while a critic ranks and binds high-quality evidence to drafted content to ensure verifiability and reduce hallucinations.

Dynamic (DA) and momentum (MA) optimization is a multipoint, multiobjective design task for storage rings, ultimately informing the flux of x-ray sources and luminosity of colliders. Current state-of-art black-box optimization methods require extensive particle-tracking simulations for each trial configuration; the high computational cost restricts the extent of the search to $\\sim 10^3$ configurations, and therefore limits the quality of the final design.

Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes. Extensive experiments on the challenging RealIAD and MANTA datasets demonstrate that VSAD sets a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level visual anomaly proving its robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faViewSense - AD\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VSAD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662fMVAM\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u5355\u5e94\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u90bb\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230VALDM\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0cFRM\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38\u539f\u578b\u5185\u5b58\u5e93\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728RealIAD\u548cMANTA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u3001\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "VSAD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u5927\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7eb9\u7406\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional control methods often fail under these conditions due to their reactive nature. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a more advanced framework, leveraging process models to predict future states and optimize control actions. However, MPC relies on simplified models that often fail to capture complex dynamics, and it struggles with accurate state estimation and handling the propagation of uncertainty in manufacturing environments. Machine learning (ML) has been introduced to enhance MPC by modeling nonlinear dynamics and learning latent representations that support predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. Yet existing ML-driven MPC approaches remain deterministic and correlation-focused, motivating the exploration of generative. Generative ML offers new opportunities by learning data distributions, capturing hidden patterns, and inherently managing uncertainty, thereby complementing MPC. This review highlights five representative methods and examines how each has been integrated into MPC components, including predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. By synthesizing these cases, we outline the common ways generative ML can systematically enhance MPC and provide a framework for understanding its potential in diverse manufacturing processes. We identify key research gaps, propose future directions, and use a representative case to illustrate how generative ML-driven MPC can extend broadly across manufacturing. Taken together, this review positions generative ML not as an incremental add-on but as a transformative approach to reshape predictive control for next-generation manufacturing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u5728\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u5dee\u8ddd\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\uff0cMPC\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709ML - driven MPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e14\u5173\u6ce8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u5f0fML\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e94\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4e0eMPC\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u751f\u6210\u5f0fML\u7cfb\u7edf\u589e\u5f3aMPC\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fML\u662f\u91cd\u5851\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To protect these assets in the deployed environment, recent research has proposed model usage control mechanisms to ensure models cannot be used without proper authorization. These methods typically lock the utility of the model by embedding an access key into its parameters. However, they often assume static deployment, and largely fail to withstand continual post-deployment model updates, such as fine-tuning or task-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose ADALOC, to endow key-based model usage control with adaptability during model evolution. It strategically selects a subset of weights as an intrinsic access key, which enables all model updates to be confined to this key throughout the evolution lifecycle. ADALOC enables using the access key to restore the keyed model to the latest authorized states without redistributing the entire network (i.e., adaptation), and frees the model owner from full re-keying after each model update (i.e., lock preservation). We establish a formal foundation to underpin ADALOC, providing crucial bounds such as the errors introduced by updates restricted to the access key. Experiments on standard benchmarks, such as CIFAR-100, Caltech-256, and Flowers-102, and modern architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and ConvNeXt, demonstrate that ADALOC achieves high accuracy under significant updates while retaining robust protections. Specifically, authorized usages consistently achieve strong task-specific performance, while unauthorized usage accuracy drops to near-random guessing levels (e.g., 1.01% on CIFAR-100), compared to up to 87.01% without ADALOC.

In this study, through visualization analysis and theoretical analysis, we derived three hypotheses regarding the learning of context features to condition the denoising process. Based on these hypotheses, we developed Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model that achieves high performance. We further enhance the model by introducing a modified classifier-free guidance strategy tailored for VTON's spatial concatenation conditioning, and by directly injecting the ground-truth garment latent derived from the clean garment latent to prevent the accumulation of prediction error. The proposed Re-CatVTON significantly improves performance compared to its predecessor (CatVTON) and requires less computation and memory than the high-performance Dual UNet model, Leffa.

While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting.

On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion.

To capture both fine-grained semantics and global hierarchy, we propose HyperbolicRAG, a retrieval framework that integrates hyperbolic geometry into graph-based RAG.

Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones.

In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations.In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arxiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp.\n  Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in.

Among flow models' accelerating methods, ReFlow has been somehow overlooked although it has theoretical consistency with flow matching. This is primarily due to its suboptimal performance in practical scenarios compared to consistency distillation and score distillation. In this work, we investigate this issue within the ReFlow framework and propose FlowSteer, a method unlocks the potential of ReFlow-based distillation by guiding the student along teacher's authentic generation trajectories. We first identify that Piecewised ReFlow's performance is hampered by a critical distribution mismatch during the training and propose Online Trajectory Alignment(OTA) to resolve it.

Values evolve over time and influence one another across sequences. These correlations improve prediction in healthcare, finance, and smart-city control yet violate the record-independence assumption built into most Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. To restore rigorous privacy guarantees without sacrificing utility, we introduce Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy (CSDP), a framework specifically designed for preserving privacy in correlated sequential data. CSDP addresses two linked challenges: quantifying the extra information an attacker gains from joint temporal and cross-sequence links, and adding just enough noise to hide that information while keeping the data useful. We model multivariate streams as a Coupling Markov Chain, yielding the derived loose leakage bound expressed with a few spectral terms and revealing a counterintuitive result: stronger coupling can actually decrease worst-case leakage by dispersing perturbations across sequences. Guided by these bounds, we build the Freshness-Regulated Adaptive Noise (FRAN) mechanism--combining data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise--that runs in linear time. Tests on two-sequence datasets show that CSDP improves the privacy-utility trade-off by approximately 50% over existing correlated-DP methods and by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard DP approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5e8f\u5217\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08CSDP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efaFRAN\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793aCSDP\u5728\u9690\u79c1 - \u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8fdd\u53cd\u591a\u6570\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7528\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u4e25\u683c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6d41\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u6cc4\u6f0f\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u6784\u5efaFRAN\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "CSDP\u5728\u4e24\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u79c1 - \u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u7ea650%\uff0c\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "CSDP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u79c1 - \u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

Its advantages have led to widespread adoption in domains such as medical image segmentation. However, the existing approaches mostly overlook the potential benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, where each client contains segmentation data of different organs. In this work, we introduce a novel personalized federated approach for organ agnostic tumor segmentation (FedOAP), that utilizes cross-attention to model long-range dependencies among the shared features of different clients and a boundary-aware loss to improve segmentation consistency. FedOAP employs a decoupled cross-attention (DCA), which enables each client to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs aggregated from all clients, thereby capturing long-range inter-organ feature dependencies. Additionally, we introduce perturbed boundary loss (PBL) which focuses on the inconsistencies of the predicted mask's boundary for each client, forcing the model to localize the margins more precisely. We evaluate FedOAP on diverse tumor segmentation tasks spanning different organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated and personalized segmentation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u5668\u5b98\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5FedOAP\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u5668\u5b98\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165FedOAP\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08DCA\uff09\u6355\u83b7\u8de8\u5668\u5b98\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6270\u52a8\u8fb9\u754c\u635f\u5931\uff08PBL\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5272\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5668\u5b98\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cFedOAP\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FedOAP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u5668\u5b98\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The main contributions are: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian sparsification scheme that is seamlessly integrated into the AKF framework and adapted to sequentially collected data in online scenarios; (2) an update mechanism that adapts the Kalman posterior to reflect the updated selection of the basis functions that define the model structure; (3) an explicit gradient-descent formulation that enhances computational efficiency. Consequently, the SKI method achieves accurate model structure selection with millisecond-level efficiency and higher identification accuracy, as demonstrated by extensive simulations and real-world experiments (showing an 84.21\\% improvement in accuracy over the baseline AKF).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7ebf\u7a00\u758f\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u8bc6\u522b\uff08SKI\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408AKF\u548cARD\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6279\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u589e\u5f3a\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08AKF\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u786e\u5b9a\uff08ARD\uff09\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7ebfSKI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cSKI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u6548\u7387\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfAKF\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad884.21%\u3002", "conclusion": "SKI\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

To evaluate the performance of RCEG, a dedicated dataset for English reading comprehension is constructed to perform the experiments, and comprehensive evaluation metrics are used to analyze the experimental results.

We demonstrate that Blu-WERP significantly outperforms established baselines including DCLM across multiple model scales and evaluation benchmarks. Our pipeline processes CC WARC dumps, implementing advanced filtering and quality assessment mechanisms. We conducted comprehensive evaluations using models with 150M, 400M, 530M, 750M, and 1B parameters, testing against nine standard benchmarks categorized as World Knowledge & Reasoning, Language Understanding, and Commonsense Reasoning. Results show Blu-WERP consistently achieved superior performance across all model scales. At the 1B parameter scale, Relatively Blu-WERP demonstrates a 4.0% and 9.5% aggregate improvement over DCLM and Fineweb respectively, while achieving quality-per-token efficiency gain. Categorical analysis reveals 2.4% improvement in World Knowledge & Reasoning, 6.2% improvement in Language Understanding, and 4.2% improvement in Commonsense Reasoning.

While ABAC provides fine-grained, context-aware access management, the increasing number and complexity of access policies can make their formulation and evaluation rather challenging. To address the task of synthesizing concise yet accurate policies, we evaluate the performance of some of the state-of-the-art LLMs, specifically Google Gemini (Flash and Pro) and OpenAI ChatGPT, as potential policy mining engines. An experimental framework was developed in Python to generate randomized access data parameterized by varying numbers of subjects, objects, and initial policy sets. The baseline policy sets, which govern permission decisions between subjects and objects, serve as the ground truth for comparison. Each LLM-generated policy was evaluated against the baseline policy using standard performance metrics. The results indicate that LLMs can effectively infer compact and valid ABAC policies for small-scale scenarios. However, as the system size increases, characterized by higher numbers of subjects and objects, LLM outputs exhibit declining accuracy and precision, coupled with significant increase in the size of policy generated, which is beyond the optimal size. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLM architectures for scalable policy mining in access control domains.

Experiments on a 7-DoF manipulator in an obstacle-rich reaching environment show that neural feedback accelerates reinforcement learning and, depending on the human-feedback weighting, can yield task success rates that at times exceed those of sparse-reward baselines. Moreover, when applying the best-performing feedback weighting across all sub jects, we observe consistent acceleration of reinforcement learning relative to the sparse-reward setting. Furthermore, leave-one subject-out evaluations confirm that the proposed framework remains robust despite the intrinsic inter-individual variability in EEG decodability. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based reinforcement learning can scale beyond locomotion tasks and provide a viable pathway for human-aligned manipulation skill acquisition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u5426\u52a0\u901f\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eEEG\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e14\u6846\u67b6\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80EEG\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5bfc\u822a\u6216\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u5426\u6539\u5584\u9ad8\u7ef4\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684EEG\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u76f8\u5173\u7535\u4f4d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bcc\u542b\u969c\u788d\u7269\u76847\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u53cd\u9988\u52a0\u901f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u91cd\u4e0b\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6709\u65f6\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6743\u91cd\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7559\u4e00\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eEEG\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries.

However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBPGO\u6269\u5c55GRPO\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eGRPO\u53ca\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "GRPO\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u5e94\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4GRPO\u5229\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165BPGO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u951a\u70b9\u5efa\u6a21\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7ec4\u95f4\u548c\u7ec4\u5185\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cBPGO\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "BPGO\u662fGRPO\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We introduce a benchmark evaluating both the necessity and effectiveness of web access across commercial models with no access to internal states or parameters. The dataset includes a static split of 783 temporally anchored questions answerable from pre-cutoff knowledge, aimed at testing whether models invoke search based on low internal confidence, and a dynamic split of 288 post-cutoff queries designed to test whether models recognise when search is required and retrieve updated information. Web access substantially improves static accuracy for GPT-5-mini and Claude Haiku 4.5, though confidence calibration worsens. On dynamic queries, both models frequently invoke search yet remain below 70 percent accuracy due to weak query formulation. Costs per accuracy-improving call remain low, but returns diminish once initial retrieval fails. Selective invocation helps, but models become overconfident and inconsistent after search. Overall, built-in web search meaningfully improves factual accuracy and can be invoked selectively, yet models remain overconfident, skip retrieval when it is essential, and falter once initial search queries underperform.

This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

This paper presents an experimental study of checkpoint installation protocols and integrity validation for AI training on macOS/APFS. We implement three write modes with increasing durability guarantees: unsafe (baseline, no fsync), atomic_nodirsync (file-level durability via fsync()), and atomic_dirsync (file + directory durability). We design a format-agnostic integrity guard using SHA-256 checksums with automatic rollback. Through controlled experiments including crash injection (430 unsafe-mode trials) and corruption injection (1,600 atomic-mode trials), we demonstrate that the integrity guard detects 99.8-100% of corruptions with zero false positives. Performance overhead is 56.5-108.4% for atomic_nodirsync and 84.2-570.6% for atomic_dirsync relative to the unsafe baseline.

We present Brain-MGF, a multimodal graph fusion network for joint EEG-fMRI connectivity analysis. For each modality, we construct graphs with partial-correlation edges and Pearson-profile node features, and learn subject-level embeddings via graph convolution. An adaptive softmax gate then fuses modalities with sample-specific weights to capture context-dependent contributions. Using the world's largest single-site psilocybin dataset, PsiConnect, Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from no-psilocybin conditions in meditation and rest. Fusion improves over unimodal and non-adaptive variants, achieving 74.0% accuracy and 76.5% F1 score on meditation, and 76.0% accuracy with 85.8% ROC-AUC on rest. UMAP visualisations reveal clearer class separation for fused embeddings.

Most existing BIQA approaches fuse shallow and deep features extracted from backbone networks, while overlooking the unequal contributions to quality prediction. Moreover, while various vision encoder backbones are widely adopted in BIQA, the effective quality decoding architectures remain underexplored. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the contributions of shallow and deep features to BIQA, and proposes a effective quality feature decoding framework via GCN-enhanced \\underline{l}ayer\\underline{i}nteraction and MoE-based \\underline{f}eature d\\underline{e}coupling, termed \\textbf{(Life-IQA)}. Specifically, the GCN-enhanced layer interaction module utilizes the GCN-enhanced deepest-layer features as query and the penultimate-layer features as key, value, then performs cross-attention to achieve feature interaction. Moreover, a MoE-based feature decoupling module is proposed to decouple fused representations though different experts specialized for specific distortion types or quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Life-IQA shows more favorable balance between accuracy and cost than a vanilla Transformer decoder and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BIQA benchmarks.The code is available at: \\href{https://github.com/TANGLONG2/Life-IQA/tree/main}{\\texttt{Life-IQA}}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u76f2\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08BIQA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u4e0d\u5747\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u7801\u67b6\u6784\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLife - IQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6210\u672c\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709BIQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\u6d45\u5c42\u548c\u6df1\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u5bf9\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u7801\u67b6\u6784\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLife - IQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bGCN\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5c42\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u7528GCN\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6700\u6df1\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5012\u6570\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u952e\u548c\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eMoE\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u8026\u878d\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff09\u3002", "result": "Life - IQA\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6210\u672c\u95f4\u6bd4\u666e\u901aTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aBIQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0Life - IQA\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5728BIQA\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Previous Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) research in speech and sound analysis often evaluates models under fixed or mismatched noise settings, that fail to mimic real-world variability. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents DHAuDS (Dynamic and Heterogeneous Audio Domain Shift), a benchmark designed to assess TTA approaches under more realistic and diverse acoustic shifts.

In conflict zones, damaged zones often share similar architectural styles, with damage typically covering small areas and exhibiting blurred boundaries. These characteristics lead to limited data, annotation difficulties, and significant recognition challenges, including high intra-class similarity and ambiguous semantic changes. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet). The powerful visual representation capability of the DINOv3 backbone enables robust and rich feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images. We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. Unlike conventional semantic change detection (SCD), our approach eliminates the need for large-scale semantic annotations of bi-temporal images, instead focusing directly on the changed regions. We term this new task change semantic detection (CSD). The CSD task represents a direct extension of binary change detection (BCD). Due to the limited spatial extent of semantic regions, it presents greater challenges than traditional SCD tasks. We evaluated our method under the CSD framework on both the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets.

NeuroVascU-Net builds on a dilated U-Net and integrates two specialized modules: a Multi-Scale Contextual Feature Fusion ($MSC^2F$) module at the bottleneck and a Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion ($CDA^2F$) module at deeper hierarchical layers. $MSC^2F$ captures both local and global information via multi-scale dilated convolutions, while $CDA^2F$ dynamically integrates domain-specific features, enhancing representation while keeping computation low. The model was trained and validated on a curated dataset of T1CE scans from 137 brain tumor biopsy patients, annotated by a board-certified functional neurosurgeon. NeuroVascU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841, accurately segmenting both major and fine vascular structures.

This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies.

Guided by these observations, we design an effective training scheme that accelerates the formation of instantaneous velocity, then shifts emphasis from short- to long-interval average velocity. Our enhanced MeanFlow training yields faster convergence and significantly better few-step generation: With the same DiT-XL backbone, our method reaches an impressive FID of 2.87 on 1-NFE ImageNet 256x256, compared to 3.43 for the conventional MeanFlow baseline.

In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models).

Simulations provide galaxy images with ground-truth physical labels, but domain shifts in PSF, noise, backgrounds, selection, and label priors degrade transfer to real surveys. We present a preliminary domain adaptation pipeline that trains on simulated TNG50 galaxies and evaluates on real SDSS galaxies with morphology labels (elliptical/spiral/irregular). We train three backbones (CNN, $E(2)$-steerable CNN, ResNet-18) with focal loss and effective-number class weighting, and a feature-level domain loss $L_D$ built from GeomLoss (entropic Sinkhorn OT, energy distance, Gaussian MMD, and related metrics). We show that a combination of these losses with an OT-based \"top_$k$ soft matching\" loss that focuses $L_D$ on the worst-matched source-target pairs can further enhance domain alignment. With Euclidean distance, scheduled alignment weights, and top-$k$ matching, target accuracy (macro F1) rises from $\\sim$46% ($\\sim$30%) at no adaptation to $\\sim$87% ($\\sim$62.6%), with a domain AUC near 0.5, indicating strong latent-space mixing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u661f\u7cfb\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u521d\u6b65\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u76ee\u6807\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u5149\u5ea6\u8c03\u67e5\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u661f\u7cfb\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u8c03\u67e5\u5b58\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u6a21\u62dfTNG50\u661f\u7cfb\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u5f62\u6001\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u771f\u5b9eSDSS\u661f\u7cfb\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e09\u79cd\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6570\u7c7b\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u57df\u635f\u5931$L_D$\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408OT-based\u201ctop_$k$ soft matching\u201d\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u540e\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u5b8f\u89c2F1\uff09\u4ece\u65e0\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u7684\u7ea646%\uff08\u7ea630%\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u7ea687%\uff08\u7ea662.6%\uff09\uff0c\u57dfAUC\u63a5\u8fd10.5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f3a\u6df7\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u76ee\u6807\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u5c1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5b57\u5e55\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u670d\u88c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u514b\u670d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u5c1a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u4e14\u98ce\u683c\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u7684\u591a\u670d\u88c5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3001k - means\u805a\u7c7b\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3b\u8272\u3001CLIP - FAISS\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u793a\u4f8b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5b57\u5e55\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684BLIP\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "YOLO\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u4e5d\u7c7b\u670d\u88c5\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5747\u503c\uff08mAP@0.5\uff09\u8fbe0.71\uff1bRAG - LLM\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b57\u5e55\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5c5e\u6027\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e3a0.80\uff1bBLIP\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u65f6\u5c1a\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing methods implement \"least-restrictive\" filtering that discretely switch between nominal and safety policies, potentially undermining the task performance that makes modern visuomotor policies valuable. While reachability value functions can, in principle, be adapted to be control barrier functions (CBFs) for smooth optimization-based filtering, we theoretically and empirically show that current latent-space learning methods produce fundamentally incompatible value functions. We identify two sources of incompatibility: First, in HJ reachability, failures are encoded via a \"margin function\" in latent space, whose sign indicates whether or not a latent is in the constraint set. However, representing the margin function as a classifier yields saturated value functions that exhibit discontinuous jumps. We prove that the value function's Lipschitz constant scales linearly with the margin function's Lipschitz constant, revealing that smooth CBFs require smooth margins. Second, reinforcement learning (RL) approximations trained solely on safety policy data yield inaccurate value estimates for nominal policy actions, precisely where CBF filtering needs them. We propose the LatentCBF, which addresses both challenges through gradient penalties that lead to smooth margin functions without additional labeling, and a value-training procedure that mixes data from both nominal and safety policy distributions. Experiments on simulated benchmarks and hardware with a vision-based manipulation policy demonstrate that LatentCBF enables smooth safety filtering while doubling the task-completion rate over prior switching methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLatentCBF\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u91c7\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5207\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u524d\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLatentCBF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u5f97\u5230\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fb9\u7f18\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6807\u79f0\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cLatentCBF\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e00\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "LatentCBF\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point.

In this study, we systematically evaluated a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier under multiple augmentation and enhancement strategies across several heterogeneous public datasets, as well as the AEyeDB dataset, a high-quality fundus dataset created in-house and made available for the research community. The ViT demonstrated consistently strong performance, with accuracies ranging from 0.789 to 0.843 across datasets and diseases. Diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration were detected reliably, whereas glaucoma remained the most frequently misclassified disease. Geometric and color augmentations provided the most stable improvements, while histogram equalization benefited datasets dominated by structural subtlety. Laplacian enhancement reduced performance across different settings.\n  On the Papila dataset, the ViT with geometric augmentation achieved an AUC of 0.91, outperforming previously reported convolutional ensemble baselines (AUC of 0.87), underscoring the advantages of transformer architectures and multi-dataset training. To complement the classifier, we developed a GANomaly-based anomaly detector, achieving an AUC of 0.76 while providing inherent reconstruction-based explainability and robust generalization to unseen data.

This paper proposes an unbiased, risk-aware framework for agentic negotiation, designed to ensure robust resource allocation in 6G network slicing. Specifically, agents leverage Digital Twins (DTs) to predict full latency distributions, which are then evaluated using a formal framework from extreme value theory, namely, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). This approach fundamentally shifts the agent's objective from reasoning over the mean to reasoning over the tail, thereby building a statistically-grounded buffer against worst-case outcomes. Furthermore, our framework ensures full uncertainty awareness by requiring agents to quantify epistemic uncertainty -- confidence in their own DTs predictions -- and propagate this meta-verification to make robust decisions, preventing them from acting on unreliable data. We validate this framework in a 6G inter-slice negotiation use-case between an eMBB and a URLLC agent. The results demonstrate the profound failure of the biased, mean-based baseline, which consistently fails its SLAs with a 25\\% rate. Our unbiased, CVaR-aware agent successfully mitigates this bias, eliminating SLA violations and reducing the URLLC and eMBB p99.999 latencies by around 11\\%. We show this reliability comes at the rational and quantifiable cost of slightly reduced energy savings to 17\\%, exposing the false economy of the biased approach.

To address this limitation, we propose a Torsion-Space Diffusion Model that generates protein backbones by denoising torsion angles, ensuring perfect local geometry by construction. A differentiable forward-kinematics module reconstructs 3D coordinates with fixed 3.8 Angstrom backbone bond lengths while a constrained post-processing refinement optimizes global compactness via Radius of Gyration (Rg) correction, without violating bond constraints. Experiments on standard PDB proteins demonstrate 100% bond-length accuracy and significantly improved structural compactness, reducing Rg error from 70% to 18.6% compared to Cartesian diffusion baselines.

In this work, we explore how to equip them with a plug-and-play memory that injects useful world knowledge. Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time.

Initially, the violation widens the representational subspace, followed by a collapse after a mid-stack bottleneck. This might indicate an exploratory phase that transitions into rapid consolidation. Taken together, these results contemplate the idea of alignment with classical psycholinguistic findings in human reading, where semantic anomalies are detected only after syntactic resolution, occurring later in the online processing sequence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u679c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bphi - 2\u5982\u4f55\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6599\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u53ca\u5728\u4f55\u5904\u5bdf\u89c9\u53e5\u5b50\u8bed\u4e49\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6311\u9009\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u8bc4\u4f30phi - 2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u5c42\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bcf\u5c42\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7f16\u7801\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u4f4e\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u5c42\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5408\u7406\u548c\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7ed3\u5c3e\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u8fdd\u89c4\u5148\u62d3\u5bbd\u8868\u5f81\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7ecf\u4e2d\u95f4\u74f6\u9888\u540e\u6536\u7f29\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u9605\u8bfb\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5f02\u5e38\u5728\u53e5\u6cd5\u89e3\u6790\u540e\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u3002"}}

Existing works primarily focus on methods such as adjusting networks or training strategies to address noisy image recognition, and the anti-noise performance has reached a bottleneck. However, little is known about the exploration of anti-interference solutions from a neuronal perspective.This paper proposes an anti-noise neuronal convolution. This convolution mimics the dendritic structure of neurons, integrates the neighborhood interaction computation logic of dendrites into the underlying design of convolutional operations, and simulates the XOR logic preprocessing function of biological dendrites through nonlinear interactions between input features, thereby fundamentally reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction. Unlike traditional convolution where noise directly interferes with feature extraction and exerts a significant impact, DDC mitigates the influence of noise by focusing on the interaction of neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate that in image classification tasks (using YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, and EfficientNet-B0) and object detection tasks (using YOLOv11, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5), after replacing traditional convolution with the dendritic convolution, the accuracy of the EfficientNet-B0 model on noisy datasets is relatively improved by 11.23%, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv8 is increased by 19.80%.

Authors marked with * contributed equally. Yi Liu is the lead author", "summary": "With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

Finetuning on one task can unpredictably affect performance on others, making task-specific finetuning challenging. In this paper, we address this challenge through a systematic study of task transferability. We examine how finetuning a VLM on one perception task affects its zero-shot performance on others. To quantify these effects, we introduce Perfection Gap Factor (PGF), a metric that captures both the breadth and magnitude of transfer. Using three open-weight VLMs evaluated across 13 perception tasks, we construct a task-transfer graph that reveals previously unobserved relationships among perception tasks. Our analysis uncovers patterns of positive and negative transfer, identifies groups of tasks that mutually influence each other, organizes tasks into personas based on their transfer behavior and demonstrates how PGF can guide data selection for more efficient training. These findings highlight both opportunities for positive transfer and risks of negative interference, offering actionable guidance for advancing VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165PGF\u6307\u6807\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u56fe\uff0c\u4e3aVLMs\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "VLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e00\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4f1a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u5fae\u8c03\u4e00\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f15\u5165PGF\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cdVLMs\u572813\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6b63\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7ec4\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8fc1\u79fb\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5c55\u793aPGF\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51fa\u6b63\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u673a\u4f1a\u548c\u8d1f\u5411\u5e72\u6270\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdbVLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Birdsongs involve rapid frequency-modulated chirps, complex amplitude envelopes, distinctive acoustic patterns, overlapping calls, and dynamic inter-bird interactions, all of which require precise temporal and spatial control in 3D environments. Existing approaches, whether Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-based or data-driven, typically focus only on single species modeling, static call structures, or synthesis directly from recordings, and often suffer from noise, limited flexibility, or large data needs. To address these challenges, we present a novel, fully algorithm-driven framework that generates dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes using DSP-based chirp generation and 3D spatialization, without relying on recordings or training data. Our approach simulates multiple independently-moving birds per species along different moving 3D trajectories, supporting controllable chirp sequences, overlapping choruses, and realistic 3D motion in scalable soundscapes while preserving species-specific acoustic patterns. A visualization interface provides bird trajectories, spectrograms, activity timelines, and sound waves for analytical and creative purposes. Both visual and audio evaluations demonstrate the ability of the system to generate dense, immersive, and ecologically inspired soundscapes, highlighting its potential for computer music, interactive virtual environments, and computational bioacoustics research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u7269\u79cd\u9e1f\u9e23\u58f0\u666f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u7269\u79cd\u9e1f\u9e23\u58f0\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5982\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u7269\u79cd\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7b49\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b8c\u5168\u7b97\u6cd5\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eDSP\u7684\u5541\u557e\u751f\u6210\u548c3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u5316\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u7269\u79cd\u591a\u53ea\u72ec\u7acb\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u9e1f\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u754c\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u4e14\u5177\u751f\u6001\u7075\u611f\u7684\u58f0\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u97f3\u4e50\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

A single neural network parameterizes both the velocity and pressure fields, and is trained by minimizing the residual of a Poisson's equation for pressure, constrained by the momentum and continuity equations, together with boundary conditions on the velocity field. No boundary conditions are imposed on the pressure field aside from anchoring the pressure at a point to prevent its unbounded development. The training is performed from scratch without labeled data, relying solely on the governing equations and constraints. To enhance accuracy in advection-dominated flows, we employ a single Fourier feature mapping of the input coordinates. The proposed method is demonstrated for the canonical lid-driven cavity flow up to a Reynolds number of 7,500 and for laminar flow over a circular cylinder with inflow-outflow boundary conditions, achieving excellent agreement with benchmark solutions.

We present a rigorous, reproducible computational framework for applying neural topic modeling to focus group transcripts, addressing fundamental methodological challenges: hyperparameter sensitivity, model stability, and validation of interpretability. Using BERTopic applied to ten focus groups exploring HPV vaccine perceptions in Tunisia (1,076 utterances), we conducted systematic evaluation across 27 hyperparameter configurations, assessed stability through bootstrap resampling with 30 replicates per configuration, and validated interpretability through formal human evaluation by three domain experts. Our analysis demonstrates substantial sensitivity to hyperparameter choices and reveals that metric selection for stability assessment must align with analytical goals. A hierarchical merging strategy (extracting fine-grained topics for stability then consolidating for interpretability) effectively navigates the stability-coherence tradeoff, achieving coherence of 0.558 compared to 0.539 for direct extraction. Human validation confirmed topic quality with very good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.79, weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.578).

We propose a novel approach that integrates a computational tonal tension model, based on tonal interval vector analysis, into a Transformer framework. Our method employs a two-level beam search strategy during inference. At the token level, generated candidates are re-ranked using model probability and diversity metrics to maintain overall quality. At the bar level, a tension-based re-ranking is applied to ensure that the generated music aligns with a desired tension curve.

This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods.

However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability.

However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature.

Across four long-form deep research benchmarks in science, healthcare and general domains, DR Tulu substantially outperforms existing open deep research models, and matches or exceeds proprietary deep research systems, while being significantly smaller and cheaper per query.

In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects.

Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs) have introduced new opportunities for leveraging external semantic knowledge to guide SFDA. However, relying on a single FM is often insufficient, as it tends to bias adaptation toward a restricted semantic coverage, failing to capture diverse contextual cues under domain shift. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Collaborative Multi-foundation Adaptation (CoMA) framework that jointly leverages two different FMs (e.g., CLIP and BLIP) with complementary properties to capture both global semantics and local contextual cues. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional adaptation mechanism that (1) aligns different FMs with the target model for task adaptation while maintaining their semantic distinctiveness, and (2) transfers complementary knowledge from the FMs to the target model. To ensure stable adaptation under mini-batch training, we introduce Decomposed Mutual Information (DMI) that selectively enhances true dependencies while suppressing false dependencies arising from incomplete class coverage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SFDA methods across four benchmarks, including Office-31, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, and VisDA, under the closed-set setting, while also achieving best results on partial-set and open-set variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCoMA\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165DMI\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bed\u4e49\u8986\u76d6\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoMA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165DMI\u6291\u5236\u865a\u5047\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5c01\u95ed\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u96c6\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "CoMA\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.

This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faChain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT)\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347VLMs\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVLMs\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165COVT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7ea620\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5c0f\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4ece\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e2d\u63d0\u70bc\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6VLM\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u4ee5\u91cd\u5efa\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5c06COVT\u96c6\u6210\u5230Qwen2.5 - VL\u548cLLaVA\u7b49\u5f3aVLMs\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u5341\u591a\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53473%\u523016%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u89c9\u601d\u7ef4\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $\u03c0_0$, $\u03c0_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $\u03c0_{\\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $\u03c0_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.

We convert the trajectories into preference tuples and filter out samples with JSON parsing errors, resulting in VDC-Agent-19K, which contains 18,886 automatically constructed pairs. We then fine-tune the base MLLM on this dataset using an easy-to-hard curriculum direct preference optimization. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, our VDC-Agent-7B attains state-of-the-art performance on the VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving over the base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score at similar inference cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u5927\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8be6\u7ec6\u5b57\u5e55\u6846\u67b6VDC - Agent\uff0c\u7ecf\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5904\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u5728VDC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u5927\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8be6\u7ec6\u5b57\u5e55\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u6210\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u3001\u539f\u5219\u6307\u5bfc\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u95ed\u73af\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u8def\u5f84\u4fee\u6b63\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u89c6\u9891\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u542b18,886\u5bf9\u7684VDC - Agent - 19K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eQwen2.5 - VL - 7B - Instruct\u7684VDC - Agent - 7B\u5728VDC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "VDC - Agent\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u8be6\u7ec6\u5b57\u5e55\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u4ee5\u76f8\u4f3c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures. Such estimators combine classical neural networks with parametrized quantum circuits, and their deployment typically entails tedious tuning of hyperparameters controlling the sample size, network architecture, and circuit topology. This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (R\u00e9nyi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|\u0398(\\mathcal{U})|d/\u03b5^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $\u0398(\\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $\u03b5$. Additionally, if the density operator pairs are permutation invariant, we improve the dimension dependence above to $O(|\u0398(\\mathcal{U})|\\mathrm{polylog}(d)/\u03b5^2)$. Our theory aims to facilitate principled implementation of QNEs for measured relative entropies and guide hyperparameter tuning in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08QNEs\uff09\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08R\u00e9nyi\uff09\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\u754c\u548c\u6307\u6570\u5c3e\u754c\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u526f\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdbQNEs\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u71b5\u548c\u6563\u5ea6\u65f6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u7e41\u7410\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08R\u00e9nyi\uff09\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u7684QNEs\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\u754c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6307\u6570\u5c3e\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u5728\u6709\u754cThompson\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b97\u5b50\u5bf9\u7684\u526f\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b97\u5b50\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u52a9\u4e8eQNEs\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u4e0a\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u3002"}}

Computational approaches, including Density Functional Theory (DFT) and calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD), facilitate screening of phase formability as a function of composition and temperature. However, the integration of computational predictions with experimental validation remains challenging in high-throughput studies. In this work, we introduce a quantitative confidence metric to assess the agreement between predictions and experimental observations, providing a quantitative measure of the confidence of machine learning models trained on either DFT or CALPHAD input in accounting for experimental evidence. The experimental dataset was generated via high-throughput in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction on compositionally varied FeNiMnCr alloy libraries, heated from room temperature to ~1000 \u00b0C. Agreement between the observed and predicted phases was evaluated using either temperature-independent phase classification or a model that incorporates a temperature-dependent probability of phase formation.
