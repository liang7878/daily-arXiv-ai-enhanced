Yet\nmost LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success\ncriteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving\nuncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of\nthe same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which\nLMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer\nreliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these\npriors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to\nsamples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we\nfind that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.\nPerformance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the\nmodel, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning\neffort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging\nevaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are\nbetter at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty."}

In this\nstudy, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system\ncomprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating\nisland agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects\n(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The\nhummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm\nfrom the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain\nefficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the\never-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained\nusing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate\nflower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial\nstate, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between\nthese agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across\nvarious environmental configurations.

We present Hive hash table, a\nhigh-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table\nthat adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.\n  Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed\nbucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory\naccess and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous\nconcurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and\nWarp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic\noperation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a\nload-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in\nwarp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced\noccupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs\na four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and\noverflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded\nrecovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while\neliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.\n  Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains\nload factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than\nstate-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed\ninsert-delete-lookup workloads.

Compared to a benchmark without model uncertainty, robust\ninsurance pricing results in significantly higher premiums and equity\nvaluations. Notably, our model yields three novel insights: (1) The minimum,\nmaximum, and admissible range of aggregate capacity all expand, indicating that\ninsurers' liquidity management becomes more conservative. (2) The expected\nlength of the underwriting cycle increases substantially, far exceeding the\nrange commonly reported in earlier empirical studies.

This creates\ntwo problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when\nhuman intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't\ndistinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under\ndelay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially\nin machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of\nabilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under\nperturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their\ncausal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require\nevidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible\nextensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with\ntransparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that\nseparates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These\nadditions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I\nclose with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without\narchitectural access."}

While large language\nmodels (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised\nfinetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a\nnew bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.\nExisting selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$\ndecoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent\nscoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained\nsemantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we\nintroduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate\nselection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament\nmechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills\nreasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,\nenabling accurate and interpretable judgments.

Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by\ntask-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to\nground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,\nvanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability\nthat at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across\ntraining steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.\nInspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping\nLLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with\nenvironmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this\nworld model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and\ntransition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement\nlearning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised\nfinetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the\nenvironment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy\noptimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling\nbaseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.\nExperiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku\nshow that our approach significantly improves performance.

Additionally, we perform\nfurther experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters\n(i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this\nvariation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE\nis particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as\nTinyBERT and BERT-Small, consistently exceeding standard model fine-tuning\nacross benchmarks.

In addition to convergence in training,\ncorrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human\npreferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the\nexisting literature does not include specifications for goals that are both\ncorrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives.

In the literature, most existing methods estimate\npixel-wise class probabilities, then apply argmax or thresholding to obtain the\nfinal prediction. These methods have been shown to generally lead to\ninconsistent or suboptimal results, as they do not directly maximize\nsegmentation metrics. To address this issue, a novel consistent segmentation\nframework, RankSEG, has been proposed, which includes RankDice and RankIoU\nspecifically designed to optimize the Dice and IoU metrics, respectively.\nAlthough RankSEG almost guarantees improved performance, it suffers from two\nmajor drawbacks. First, it is its computational expense-RankDice has a\ncomplexity of O(d log d) with a substantial constant factor (where d represents\nthe number of pixels), while RankIoU exhibits even higher complexity O(d^2),\nthus limiting its practical application. For instance, in LiTS, prediction with\nRankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule.\nSecond, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where\nmultiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard\nbenchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation. In this paper,\nwe overcome these two drawbacks via a reciprocal moment approximation (RMA) of\nRankSEG with the following contributions: (i) we improve RankSEG using RMA,\nnamely RankSEG-RMA, reduces the complexity of both algorithms to O(d) while\nmaintaining comparable performance; (ii) inspired by RMA, we develop a\npixel-wise score function that allows efficient implementation for\nnon-overlapping segmentation settings."}

We synthesize recent studies into three major research axes:\ninformation theoretic open set recognition enabling safe rejection of unknowns,\ninformation driven novelty discovery guiding new concept formation, and\ninformation retentive continual learning ensuring stable long term adaptation.\nFurthermore, we discuss theoretical connections between information theory and\nprovable learning frameworks, including PAC Bayes bounds, open-space risk\ntheory, and causal information flow, to establish a pathway toward provable and\ntrustworthy open world intelligence. Finally, the review identifies key open\nproblems and future research directions, such as the quantification of\ninformation risk, development of dynamic mutual information bounds, multimodal\ninformation fusion, and integration of information theory with causal reasoning\nand world model learning."}

While large language\nmodels (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised\nfinetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a\nnew bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.\nExisting selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$\ndecoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent\nscoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained\nsemantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we\nintroduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate\nselection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament\nmechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills\nreasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,\nenabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted\nconsensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit\ngenerator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more\nefficient.

We present AURA (Agent\naUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify,\nand mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and\npractical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology\nthat balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and\npractical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score,\nevaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,\nsynchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for\nHuman-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)\ncommunication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic\nsystems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with\nestablished protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools.

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied\nto its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from\nunsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training\nin shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's\ninternal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models."}

However, in\nmodern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an\noptimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward\nscale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,\ndegrading $\\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay\nscaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,\nthe singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as\n$\\sqrt{\\eta/\\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width\nscaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as\n$\\sqrt{\\eta/\\lambda}\\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\\mu$P\nlearning-rate rule $\\eta_2\\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an\nempirical weight-decay scaling rule $\\lambda_2\\propto \\sqrt{d}$ that\napproximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant.

Openness exerts a dual effect: it amplifies knowledge spillovers to\nthe entrant, but it also enhances the incumbent's advantage through a \"data\nflywheel effect,\" whereby greater user engagement today further lowers the\ndeployer's future fine-tuning cost. Our analysis reveals that the incumbent's\noptimal first-period openness is surprisingly non-monotonic in the strength of\nthe data flywheel effect. When the data flywheel effect is either weak or very\nstrong, the incumbent prefers a higher level of openness; however, for an\nintermediate range, it strategically restricts openness to impair the entrant's\nlearning. This dynamic gives rise to an \"openness trap,\" a critical policy\nparadox where transparency mandates can backfire by removing firms' strategic\nflexibility, reducing investment, and lowering welfare. We extend the model to\nshow that other common interventions can be similarly ineffective. Vertical\nintegration, for instance, only benefits the ecosystem when the data flywheel\neffect is strong enough to overcome the loss of a potentially more efficient\ncompetitor. Likewise, government subsidies intended to spur adoption can be\ncaptured entirely by the incumbent through strategic price and openness\nadjustments, leaving the rest of the value chain worse off. By modeling the\ndeveloper's strategic response to competitive and regulatory pressures, we\nprovide a robust framework for analyzing competition and designing effective\npolicy in the complex and rapidly evolving FM ecosystem."}

To address these limitations, we propose FIRE, a\nnovel agent-based framework that integrates evidence retrieval and claim\nverification in an iterative manner. Specifically, FIRE employs a unified\nmechanism to decide whether to provide a final answer or generate a subsequent\nsearch query, based on its confidence in the current judgment. We compare FIRE\nwith other strong fact-checking frameworks and find that it achieves slightly\nbetter performance while reducing large language model (LLM) costs by an\naverage of 7.6 times and search costs by 16.5 times.

However, the\nrapid emergence of LLMs raises questions about optimal model selection and\npotential LLM-ensemble efficacy.\n  This paper addresses the first question by identifying 76 LLMs and filtering\nthem down to suitable candidates for large-scale clone detection. The\ncandidates were evaluated on two public industrial datasets, BigCloneBench, and\na commercial large-scale dataset. No uniformly 'best-LLM' emerged, though\nCodeT5+110M, CuBERT and SPTCode were top-performers. Analysis of LLM-candidates\nsuggested that smaller embedding sizes, smaller tokenizer vocabularies and\ntailored datasets are advantageous. On commercial large-scale dataset a\ntop-performing CodeT5+110M achieved 39.71\\% precision: twice the precision of\npreviously used CodeBERT.\n  To address the second question, this paper explores ensembling of the\nselected LLMs: effort-effective approach to improving effectiveness. Results\nsuggest the importance of score normalization and favoring ensembling methods\nlike maximum or sum over averaging. Also, findings indicate that ensembling\napproach can be statistically significant and effective on larger datasets: the\nbest-performing ensemble achieved even higher precision of 46.91\\% over\nindividual LLM on the commercial large-scale code."}

Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched\nvocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and\nmodification.

Next, we show favorable performances of AB-UPT against previous\nstate-of-the-art transformer-based baselines on both datasets, followed by\nextensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our best AB-UPT model.\nAB-UPT shows strong performances across the board. Notably, it obtains near\nperfect prediction of integrated aerodynamic forces within seconds from a\nsimple isotopically tesselate geometry representation and is trainable within a\nday on a single GPU, paving the way for industry-scale applications."}

Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled\nattributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to\npredefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an\nattribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify\nsubpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)\nsemantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are\ngrouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)\ndiscovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes\nsuch as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition\nmodels (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,\nCelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in\nintra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent\ndirections aligned with demographic and contextual attributes.

The system operates online, allocating resources to\nincoming training or inference requests while minimizing energy consumption and\nmeeting performance requirements. It uses two neural networks: the first\nprovides initial estimates of how well a new model will utilize different\nhardware types and how it will affect co-located models. An optimizer then\nallocates resources based on these estimates. After deployment, the system\nmonitors real performance and uses this data to refine its predictions via a\nsecond neural network. This updated model improves estimates not only for the\ncurrent hardware but also for hardware not initially allocated and for\nco-location scenarios not yet observed. The result is an adaptive, iterative\napproach that learns over time to make more effective resource allocation\ndecisions in heterogeneous deep learning clusters."}

Adopting a physical model of the system in the form\nof partial differential equations (PDEs) is a potent method to close this gap.\nIn particular, the method of optimizing a discrete loss (ODIL) has shown great\npotential in terms of robustness and computational cost.
