Water transport\nfollows Fick's second law with a damage-dependent diffusivity obtained by\npower-law interpolation between intact concrete and crack space. Healing\nreduces damage in proportion to local moisture and a smoothed cement\navailability field computed via a Helmholtz filter. Two finite element variants\nwere implemented in FEniCSx over time horizons up to $5\\times10^6$ seconds: a\nCrack Diffusion Model (CDM) with standard diffusion and a Crack Membrane Model\n(CMM) that gates cross-crack transport until a critical moisture threshold is\nreached. Key control parameters are the initial crack orientation and size, the\ndiffusion coefficients of intact and cracked concrete, the healing rate\nconstant, and the cement availability smoothing parameter. Simulations on a\nunit square domain show that healing time varies non-monotonically with crack\norientation, peaking near $45^\\circ$ and $135^\\circ$ and minimizing near\n$90^\\circ$, consistent with diffusion distance to crack endpoints dominating\nthe process. The dependence on crack width reverses with material parameters:\nhealing time increases when $D_{\\text{cracked}}<D_{\\text{intact}}$ and\ndecreases when $D_{\\text{cracked}}>D_{\\text{intact}}$. The CMM reproduces\nstaged moisture penetration with delayed gate activation but lengthens total\nhealing time, whereas the CDM is efficient for parametric sweeps. Machine\nlearning classifiers trained on one million simulation samples predict binary\nhealing outcomes $H(\\sigma,\\gamma,t)$ (healed or not) with high accuracy (up to\n0.998 for neural networks). Although experimental calibration is still\nrequired, the framework provides a versatile tool for guiding laboratory\nstudies and implementations of self-healing concrete."}

Despite the widespread\nadoption of parallel join-based trees, a major drawback of previous work on\nsuch data structures is the inefficiency of their input/output (I/O) access\npatterns. Some recent work (e.g., C-trees and PaC-trees) focused on more\nI/O-friendly implementations of these algorithms.

The main novelties introduced by FLAS are (i) a predictive model\nof the high-level metrics trend which allows to anticipate changes in the\nrelevant SLA parameters (e.g. performance metrics such as response time or\nthroughput) and (ii) a reactive contingency system based on the estimation of\nhigh-level metrics from resource use metrics, reducing the necessary\ninstrumentation (less invasive) and allowing it to be adapted agnostically to\ndifferent applications.

That\nparadox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be\nmet by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of\nthat use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The\npaper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal\neducation, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests\nshould undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic\nresponsibility."}

A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute\nwhen left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order\ndecoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs\nto infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish\nbetween reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer\nuncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an\nanswer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the\nMDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new\nsource of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that\nfine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a\nperformance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.\nAdditionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for\nscoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps.

Existing\nmethods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions\nwithout explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and\nresults in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective\nresponses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates\nexternal tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more\nuseful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better\nexploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining\nadditional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more\naccurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's\nability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA\ndata generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks\nwith reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,\nwe collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a\ntraining set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping\nwith the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes).

This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and\nthe United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.\nUsing a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited\nfeedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three\ncases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.\nGovernments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for\ncomment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each\nnation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,\nofficials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing\nto create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between\nthe promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude\nthat current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because\npolicymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.\nThey offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;\nbroaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement\nmethods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make\nparticipation easier."}

This\nformulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the\nresulting \\textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under\nvarying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards\nspecialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain\ndependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,\nthe coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general\ncompetence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\\%).

The proposed framework achieves 99.24\\% accuracy on the 7K-DS\ndataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\\% and 99.85\\% in the 3-class\nand 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model\ngeneralizes with 95.77\\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art\nmethods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user\ninterface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor\nlocalization.

Existing hierarchical forecasting methods\ntypically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply\na reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values\nare coherent across the hierarchy.

In survival analysis,\ncensoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model\ndevelopment. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook\ndisparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be\nranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of\nmortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine\nequitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed\nto mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk\nrankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and\napplying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially\nimproves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to\nfairness-unaware survival models.

Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --\noften believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on\nclosing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.\nBridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively\nreorder predictions rather than merely rescale them.

Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by\nstructuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a\nthinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking\nbranch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.\nA lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most\nsuitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into\nan MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not\nonly substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the\nmodel's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other\nreasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building\npowerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent\nreasoning-vs-generalization dilemma."}

CMC introduces a\nPseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,\nenabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a\nParameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for\nmultimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion\nprocess toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that\nCMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods\nacross four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and\nexhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on\nCH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2.

Artificial intelligence\n(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to\nthese issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis\nand treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as\nthe most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature\nextraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent\nprogress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL\nresearch-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260\nstudies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available\ndental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the\nbasic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and\nacquisition methods of existing datasets.

Multi-variate time-series analysis has\nemerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in\nsuch environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication\npresents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor\ndata and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,\nthe complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly\nprediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to\nadvance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential\nstep toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault\nprevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:\n(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,\nand (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is\ncompared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a\npredefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the\nforecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by\nutilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second\nlifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture\ninter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting\nperformance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly\nprediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS\nmodel while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower\ncomputational cost.
