Motivated by the observation that commuting operations can be executed in parallel, we introduce conflict-obstruction-freedom: a process is guaranteed to complete its operation if it runs for long enough without encountering step contention with conflicting (non-commuting) operations. This condition generalizes obstruction-freedom and wait-freedom by allowing progress as long as step contention is only induced by commuting operations. We prove that conflict-obstruction-free universal constructions are impossible to implement in the asynchronous read-write shared memory model. This result exposes a fundamental limitation of conflict-aware universal constructions: the mere invocation of conflicting operations imposes a synchronization cost.

Many open and proprietary stacks still execute LDPC on general-purpose CPUs, raising concerns about missed-slot events and limited scalability as bandwidths, modulation orders, and user multiplexing increase. This paper empirically quantifies the benefit of offloading 5G-style LDPC5G decoding from a Grace CPU to the integrated Blackwell GB10 GPU on an NVIDIA DGX~Spark platform. Using NVIDIA Sionna PHY/SYS on TensorFlow, we construct an NR-like link-level chain with an LDPC5G encoder/decoder, 16-QAM modulation, and AWGN, and sweep both the number of codewords decoded in parallel and the number of belief-propagation iterations, timing only the decoding phase while logging CPU and GPU utilization and power. Across the sweep we observe an average GPU/CPU throughput speedup of approximately $6\\times$, with per-codeword CPU latency reaching $\\approx 0.71$\\,ms at 20 iterations (exceeding the 0.5\\,ms slot), while the GB10 GPU remains within 6--24\\% of the slot for the same workloads. Resource-usage measurements show that CPU-based LDPC decoding often consumes around ten Grace cores, whereas GPU-based decoding adds only $\\approx10-15$\\,W over GPU idle while leaving most CPU capacity available for higher-layer tasks. Because our implementation relies on high-level Sionna layers rather than hand-tuned CUDA, these results represent conservative lower bounds on achievable accelerator performance and provide a reusable, scriptable methodology for evaluating LDPC and other physical-layer kernels on future Grace/Blackwell and Aerial/ACAR/AODT platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5c065G\u98ce\u683c\u7684LDPC5G\u89e3\u7801\u4eceGrace CPU\u5378\u8f7d\u5230NVIDIA DGX~Spark\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210\u7684Blackwell GB10 GPU\u7684\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPU\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a5G\u7269\u7406\u5c42LDPC\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u901a\u7528CPU\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8fc7\u65f6\u9699\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5378\u8f7d\u5230GPU\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NVIDIA Sionna PHY/SYS\u5728TensorFlow\u4e0a\u6784\u5efaNR-like\u94fe\u8def\u7ea7\u94fe\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u7801\u5b57\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4f20\u64ad\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55CPU\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u53ca\u529f\u7387\u3002", "result": "GPU/CPU\u5e73\u5747\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u7ea6\u4e3a6\u500d\uff0c20\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u65f6CPU\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7801\u5b57\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8d850.5ms\uff0cGB10 GPU\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u5904\u4e8e\u65f6\u9699\u76846 - 24%\uff1bCPU\u89e3\u7801\u5e38\u6d88\u8017\u7ea6\u5341\u4e2aGrace\u6838\u5fc3\uff0cGPU\u89e3\u7801\u4ec5\u589e\u52a010 - 15W\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba9CPU\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u80fd\u529b\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u5b88\u4e0b\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u672a\u6765\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0aLDPC\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5185\u6838\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u811a\u672c\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While most process mining efforts focus on intra-organizational scenarios, many real-world business processes span multiple independent organizations. Inter-organizational process mining, though, faces significant challenges, particularly regarding confidentiality guarantees: The analysis of data can reveal information that the participating organizations may not consent to disclose to one another, or to a third party hosting process mining services. To overcome this issue, this paper presents CONFINE, an approach for secrecy-preserving inter-organizational process mining. CONFINE leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deploy trusted applications that are capable of securely mining multi-party event logs while preserving data secrecy. We propose an architecture supporting a four-stage protocol to secure data exchange and processing, allowing for protected transfer and aggregation of unaltered process data across organizational boundaries. To avoid out-of-memory errors due to the limited capacity of TEEs, our protocol employs a segmentation-based strategy, whereby event logs are transmitted to TEEs in smaller batches. We conduct a formal verification of correctness and a security analysis of the guarantees provided by the TEE core. We evaluate our implementation on real-world and synthetic data, showing that the proposed approach can handle realistic workloads.

Carried out under the supervision of Zhixin Lu and Gianluca Palermo", "summary": "The field of plasma physics heavily relies on simulations to model various phenomena, such as instabilities, turbulence, and nonlinear behaviors that would otherwise be difficult to study from a purely theoretical approach. Simulations are fundamental in accurately setting up experiments, which can be extremely costly and complex. As high-fidelity tools, gyrokinetic simulations play a crucial role in discovering new physics, interpreting experimental results, and improving the design of next-generation devices. However, their high computational costs necessitate the use of acceleration platforms to reduce execution time. This work revolves around the TRIangular MEsh based Gyrokinetic (TRIMEG) code, which performs high-accuracy particle-in-cell plasma simulations in tokamak geometries, leveraging a novel finite element approach. The rise of graphical processing units (GPUs) constitutes an occasion to satisfy such computational needs, by offloading the most expensive portion of the code to the accelerators. The chosen approach features GPU offloading with the OpenMP API, which grants portability of the code to different architectures, namely AMD and NVIDIA. The particle pushing as well as the grid-to-particle operations have been ported to GPU platforms. Compiler limitations had to be overcome, and portions of the code were restructured to be suitable for GPU acceleration.

Bayesian optimization is employed to adaptively construct accurate Gaussian process surrogate models using a minimal number of high-fidelity model evaluations, strategically focusing sampling in regions of high predictive uncertainty. The trained surrogate model is then leveraged within a Bayesian inversion scheme to infer optimal parameter values by combining prior knowledge with observed quantities of interest, resulting in posterior distributions that rigorously characterize epistemic uncertainty. The framework is theoretically grounded, computationally efficient, and particularly suited for engineering applications in which high-fidelity models -- whether arising from numerical simulations or physical experiments -- are computationally expensive, analytically intractable, or difficult to replicate, and data availability is limited. Furthermore, the combined use of Bayesian optimization and inversion outperforms their separate application, highlighting the synergistic benefits of unifying the two approaches. The performance of the proposed Bayesian framework is demonstrated on a suite of one- and two-dimensional analytical benchmarks, including the Mixed Gaussian-Periodic, L\u00e9vy, Griewank, Forrester, and Rosenbrock functions, which provide a controlled setting to assess surrogate modeling accuracy, parameter inference robustness, and uncertainty quantification.

To this end, column type annotation (CTA) methods associate columns of tabular datasets with semantic types that accurately describe their contents, using pre-trained deep learning models or Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches require users to specify a closed set of semantic types either at training or inference time, hindering their application to domain-specific datasets where pre-defined labels often lack adequate coverage and specificity. Furthermore, real-world datasets frequently contain columns with values belonging to multiple semantic types, violating the single-type assumption of existing CTA methods. While proprietary LLMs have shown effectiveness for CTA, they incur high monetary costs and produce inconsistent outputs for similar columns, leading to type redundancy that negatively affects downstream applications. To address these challenges, we introduce StraTyper, a cost-effective method for column type discovery (CTD) and multi-type annotation (CMTA) in dataset collections. StraTyper eliminates the need for pre-defined semantic labels by systematically employing LLMs to discovery types tailored to the dataset collection at hand. Through strategic column clustering, controlled type generation, and iterative cascading discovery, StraTyper balances type precision with annotation coverage while minimizing LLM costs. Our experimental evaluation-both manual and LLM-assisted-on real-world benchmarks demonstrates that StraTyper discovers accurate types for both numerical and non-numerical data, achieves substantial cost savings compared to commercial LLMs, and effectively handles multi-typed columns. We further show that StraTyper's annotations improve downstream tasks, including join discovery and schema matching, outperforming LLM-only baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5217\u7c7b\u578b\u6ce8\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa StraTyper \u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u8282\u7701\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5217\u7c7b\u578b\u6ce8\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u5217\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 StraTyper \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6218\u7565\u5217\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u53d7\u63a7\u7c7b\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ea7\u8054\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u7c7b\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6ce8\u91ca\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e StraTyper \u80fd\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u548c\u975e\u6570\u503c\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5546\u4e1a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8282\u7701\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u5217\u3002", "conclusion": "StraTyper \u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5217\u7c7b\u578b\u6ce8\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u6ce8\u91ca\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u8fde\u63a5\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This arXiv version contains the full appendix", "summary": "In many matching markets--such as athlete recruitment or academic admissions--participants on one side are evaluated by attribute vectors known to the other side, which in turn applies individual \\emph{salience vectors} to assign relative importance to these attributes. Since saliences are known to change in practice, a central question arises: how robust is a stable matching to such perturbations? We address several fundamental questions in this context.\n  First, we formalize robustness as a radius within which a stable matching remains immune to blocking pairs under any admissible perturbation of salience vectors (which are assumed to be normalized). Given a stable matching and a radius, we present a polynomial-time algorithm to verify whether the matching is stable within the specified radius. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the maximum robustness radius of a given stable matching. Further, we design an anytime search algorithm that uses certified lower and upper bounds to approximate the most robust stable matching, and we characterize the robustness-cost relationship through efficiently computable bounds that delineate the achievable tradeoff between robustness and cost. Finally, we show that for each stable matching, the set of salience profiles that preserve its stability factors is a product of low-dimensional polytopes within the simplex. This geometric structure precisely characterizes the polyhedral shape of each robustness region; its volume can then be computed efficiently, with approximate methods available as the dimension grows, thereby linking robustness analysis in matching markets with classical tools from convex geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5339\u914d\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u663e\u8457\u5411\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u6700\u5927\u9c81\u68d2\u534a\u5f84\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u7a33\u5065\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u533a\u57df\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5339\u914d\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5411\u91cf\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5927\u9c81\u68d2\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u968f\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u7a33\u5065\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u51f8\u51e0\u4f55\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u6790\u9c81\u68d2\u533a\u57df\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5927\u9c81\u68d2\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u7a33\u5065\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027 - \u6210\u672c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u533a\u57df\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u4f53\u79ef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5339\u914d\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u51f8\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u5de5\u5177\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u5339\u914d\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76TMK\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5426\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTMK\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u53d7\u8d28\u7591\uff0c\u7814\u7a76TMK\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5426\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728PlanBench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u805a\u7126Blocksworld\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5TMK\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u5426\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "TMK\u63d0\u793a\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece31.5%\u63d0\u5347\u523097.3%\uff0c\u8fd8\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u8f6c\u3002", "conclusion": "TMK\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8131\u79bb\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This research proposes an innovative and efficient framework that decouples algorithm discovery from high-cost evaluation. Our core innovation lies in combining a Genetic Programming (GP) function generator with an LLM-driven evolutionary algorithm designer. The evolutionary direction of the GP-based function generator is guided by the similarity between the landscape characteristics of generated proxy functions and those of real-world problems, ensuring that algorithms discovered via proxy functions exhibit comparable performance on real-world problems. Our method enables deep exploration of the algorithmic space before final validation while avoiding costly real-world evaluations.

Such memorization raises serious privacy concerns, motivating the widespread adoption of differentially private training algorithms such as DP-SGD. However, a growing body of empirical work shows that DP-SGD often leads to suboptimal generalization performance, particularly on long-tailed data that contain a large number of rare or atypical samples. Despite these observations, a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, and existing differential privacy analysis are difficult to extend to the nonconvex and nonsmooth neural networks commonly used in practice. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for analyzing DP-SGD on long-tailed data from a feature learning perspective.

This paper formulates the optimisation of the IW-ELBO in Bures-Wasserstein space, a manifold of Gaussian distributions equipped with the 2-Wasserstein metric. We derive the Wasserstein gradient of the IW-ELBO and project it onto the Bures-Wasserstein space to yield a tractable algorithm for Gaussian VI.\n  A pivotal contribution of our analysis concerns the stability of the gradient estimator. While the SNR of the standard Euclidean gradient estimator is known to vanish as the number of importance samples $K$ increases, we prove that the SNR of the Wasserstein gradient scales favourably as $\u03a9(\\sqrt{K})$, ensuring optimisation efficiency even for large $K$.

Given such trends, design space exploration (DSE) at early stages is critical to ensure agile development towards optimal performance and cost. Industry-grade EDA tools directly take in RTL code and report accurate results, but do not perform DSE. Recent works have attempted to explore the design space via simulation. However, most of these works are domain-specific and constrain the space that users are allowed to explore, offering limited flexibility between technologies, architecture, and applications. Moreover, they often demand high domain expertise to ensure high accuracy. To enable simulation that is agnostic to technology, architecture, and application at any granularity, we introduce Architecture-Graph (Agraph), a graph that unifies the system representation surrounding any arbitrary application, software, architecture, and circuit. Such a unified representation distinguishes Agraph from prior works, which focus on a single stack, allowing users to freely explore the design space across system stacks. To fully unleash the potential of Agraph, we further present Archx, a framework that implements Agraph. Archx is user-friendly in two ways. First, Archx has an easy-to-use programming interface to automatically generate and sweep design points under user constraints, boosting the programmability. Second, Archx adopts scope-based metric retrieval to analyze and understand each design point at any user-preferred hierarchy, enhancing the explainability. We conduct case studies that demonstrate Agraph's generalization across technologies, architecture, and applications with high simulation accuracy. Overall, we argue that Agraph and Archx serve as a foundation to simulate both performance and cost at will.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5f15\u5165Architecture - Graph (Agraph)\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u51faArchx\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0Agraph\uff0c\u80fd\u8de8\u6280\u672f\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u62df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\uff08DSE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6027\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7b49\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u8de8\u6280\u672f\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u793a\u7684Agraph\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u73b0Agraph\u7684Archx\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6613\u7528\u7f16\u7a0b\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6307\u6807\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eAgraph\u80fd\u8de8\u6280\u672f\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "Agraph\u548cArchx\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u968f\u610f\u6a21\u62df\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We derive theoretical foundations for each component, specify quantitative formulas incorporating data from DeFi Llama, Federal Reserve FRED, and on-chain analytics, and validate the framework against historical crisis events including the Terra/Luna collapse (May 2022), the Celsius/3AC contagion (June 2022), the FTX bankruptcy (November 2022), and the SVB banking crisis (March 2023). Event study analysis detects statistically significant abnormal signals for all four crises (t-statistics 5.47-32.64, all p < 0.01), though threshold-based operational detection identifies three of four events with an average lead time of 18 days.

Most current methods are \"coupled\" in such a way that they generate explanations simultaneously with model inferences. As a result, these approaches incur redundant computation, high latency and poor scalability when deployed across heterogeneous sets of edge devices. In this work we propose Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a distributed architecture for treating explainability as a first-class system service (as opposed to a model-specific feature). The key innovation in our proposed XaaS architecture is that it decouples inference from explanation generation allowing edge devices to request, cache and verify explanations subject to resource and latency constraints. To achieve this, we introduce three main innovations: (1) A distributed explanation cache with a semantic similarity based explanation retrieval method which significantly reduces redundant computation; (2) A lightweight verification protocol that ensures the fidelity of both cached and newly generated explanations; and (3) An adaptive explanation engine that chooses explanation methods based upon device capability and user requirement. We evaluated the performance of XaaS on three real-world edge-AI use cases: (i) manufacturing quality control; (ii) autonomous vehicle perception; and (iii) healthcare diagnostics. Experimental results show that XaaS reduces latency by 38\\% while maintaining high explanation quality across three real-world deployments.

Automated defect detection methods exist but lack interpretability, preventing engineers from understanding the physical basis of criticality predictions. This study presents an explainable computer vision framework for pore detection and criticality assessment in three-dimensional tomographic volumes. Sequential grayscale slices were reconstructed into volumetric datasets, and intensity-based thresholding with connected component analysis identified 500 individual pores. Each pore was characterized using geometric descriptors including size, aspect ratio, extent, and spatial position relative to the specimen boundary. A pore interaction network was constructed using percentile-based Euclidean distance criteria, yielding 24,950 inter-pore connections. Machine learning models predicted pore criticality scores from extracted features, and SHAP analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results demonstrate that normalized surface distance dominates model predictions, contributing more than an order of magnitude greater importance than all other descriptors. Pore size provides minimal influence, while geometric parameters show negligible impact. The strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and criticality reveals boundary-driven failure mechanisms.

However, applying them to recommendation systems is challenging since it is hard for LLMs to extract user preferences from large, sparse user-item logs, and real-time per-user ranking over the full catalog is too time-consuming to be practical. Moreover, many existing recommender systems focus solely on ranking items while overlooking explanations, which could help improve predictive accuracy and make recommendations more convincing to users. Inspired by recent works that achieve strong recommendation performance by forecasting near-term item popularity, we propose TRAIL (TRend and explAnation Integrated Learner). TRAIL is a fine-tuned LLM that jointly predicts short-term item popularity and generates faithful natural-language explanations. It employs contrastive learning with positive and negative pairs to align its scores and explanations with structured trend signals, yielding accurate and explainable popularity predictions.

Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus.

These challenges are particularly amplified in Simulink-Stateflow models due to the hierarchical structure these models have, which integrate continuous dynamics with discrete-event behaviors and are widely deployed in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). While prior work has explored machine learning and manually engineered mutation operators, these approaches remain constrained by limited training data and scalability issues. Motivated by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate their potential to generate high-quality, domain-specific mutants for Simulink-Stateflow models. We develop an automated pipeline that converts Simulink-Stateflow models to structured JSON representations and systematically evaluates different mutation and prompting strategies across eight state-of-the-art LLMs. Through a comprehensive empirical study involving 38,400 LLM-generated mutants across four Simulink-Stateflow models, we demonstrate that LLMs generate mutants up to 13x faster than a manually engineered mutation-based baseline while producing significantly fewer equivalent and duplicate mutants and consistently achieving superior mutant quality. Moreover, our analysis reveals that few-shot prompting combined with low-to-medium temperature values yields optimal results. We provide an open-source prototype tool and release our complete dataset to facilitate reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u7d22\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3aSimulink - Stateflow\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aLLM\u751f\u6210\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7a81\u53d8\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Simulink - Stateflow\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u7b49\u6548\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5df2\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u53d7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u5c55\u542f\u53d1\u5c55\u5f00\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aJSON\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u516b\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7a81\u53d8\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u6bd4\u624b\u52a8\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb13\u500d\uff0c\u7b49\u6548\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u4f4e\u6e29\u503c\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728Simulink - Stateflow\u6a21\u578b\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Our study investigates innovation at a finer spatial resolution, going beyond proprietary or static indicators. We develop the Local Innovation Determinants (LID) database and framework to identify key enabling factors across regions, combining traditional government data with publicly available data via APIs for a more granular understanding of spatial dynamics shaping innovation capacity. Using exploratory big and geospatial data analytics and random forest models, we examine neighborhoods in New York and Massachusetts across four dimensions: social factors, economic characteristics, land use and mobility, morphology, and environment.

Our main technical contribution is a modification to the EAT method that theoretically guarantees an unbiased first moment (exactly matching the firing rate), and reduces second-moment bias. We evaluate these methods on their distributional fidelity, gradient quality, and performance on two tasks: (1) variational autoencoders with Poisson latents, and (2) partially observable generalized linear models, where latent neural connectivity must be inferred from observed spike trains. Across all metrics, our modified EAT method exhibits better overall performance (often comparable to exact gradients), and substantially higher robustness to hyperparameter choices.

To address these challenges, we propose LILaC, a multimodal retrieval framework featuring two core innovations. First, we introduce a layered component graph, explicitly representing multimodal information at two layers - each representing coarse and fine granularity - facilitating efficient yet precise reasoning. Second, we develop a late-interaction-based subgraph retrieval method, an edge-based approach that initially identifies coarse-grained nodes for efficient candidate generation, then performs fine-grained reasoning via late interaction.

Space-efficient methods to answer these rank queries form an important building block in many succinct data structures. For example, the FM-index is a widely used data structure that uses rank queries to locate all occurrences of a pattern in a text.\n  In bioinformatics applications, the goal is usually to process a given input as fast as possible. Thus, data structures should have high throughput when used with many threads.\n  Contributions. For the binary alphabet, we develop BiRank with 3.28% space overhead. It merges the central ideas of two recent papers: (1) we interleave (inline) offsets in each cache line of the underlying bit vector [Laws et al., 2024], reducing cache-misses, and (2) these offsets are to the middle of each block so that only half of them need popcounting [Gottlieb and Reinert, 2025]. In QuadRank (14.4% space overhead), we extend these techniques to the $\u03c3=4$ (DNA) alphabet.\n  Both data structures require only a single cache miss per query, making them highly suitable for high-throughput and memory-bound settings. To enable efficient batch-processing, we support prefetching the cache lines required to answer upcoming queries.\n  Results. BiRank and QuadRank are around $1.5\\times$ and $2\\times$ faster than similar-overhead methods that do not use inlining. Prefetching gives an additional $2\\times$ speedup, at which point the dual-channel DDR4 RAM bandwidth becomes a hard limit on the total throughput. With prefetching, both methods outperform all other methods apart from SPIDER [Laws et al., 2024] by $2\\times$.\n  When using QuadRank with prefetching in a toy count-only FM-index, QuadFm, this results in a smaller size and up to $4\\times$ speedup over Genedex, a state-of-the-art batching FM-index implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u4f4d\u5411\u91cf\u548cDNA\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u5206\u522b\u5f00\u53d1BiRank\u548cQuadRank\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u5904\u7406rank\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9884\u53d6\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7528QuadRank\u6784\u5efa\u7684FM - index\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5c0f\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u5e94\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u65f6\u6709\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684rank\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1BiRank\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\uff1b\u5bf9DNA\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u5f00\u53d1QuadRank\u6269\u5c55\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\u3002\u652f\u6301\u9884\u53d6\u7f13\u5b58\u884c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6279\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "BiRank\u548cQuadRank\u6bd4\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u8054\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb1.5 - 2\u500d\uff0c\u9884\u53d6\u4f7f\u901f\u5ea6\u518d\u63d0\u53472\u500d\uff0cQuadRank\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u53d6\u6784\u5efa\u7684QuadFm\u6bd4Genedex\u66f4\u5c0f\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "BiRank\u548cQuadRank\u5728\u5904\u7406rank\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A generalized RLA framework has remained elusive for algorithmic election rules such as the Single Transferable Vote (STV) rule, because of the dependence of these rules on the chronology of eliminations and elections leading to the outcome of the election. This paper proposes a new graph-based approach to audit these algorithmic election rules, by considering the space of all possible sequences of elections and eliminations. If we fix a subgraph of this universal space ahead of the audit, a sufficient strategy is to verify statistically that the true election sequence does not leave the fixed subgraph. This makes for a flexible framework to audit these elections in a chronology-agnostic way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u4e3e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9009\u4e3e\u5b89\u5168\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9650\u5236\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff08RLA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6295\u7968\uff08STV\uff09\u7b49\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u4e3e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u9009\u4e3e\u548c\u6dd8\u6c70\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u9009\u4e3e\u548c\u6dd8\u6c70\u5e8f\u5217\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9884\u5148\u786e\u5b9a\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u771f\u5b9e\u9009\u4e3e\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0d\u79bb\u5f00\u8be5\u5b50\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u4e3e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u4e3e\u89c4\u5219\u3002"}}

This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

In this work, we develop PoC-Gym, a framework for PoC generation for Java security vulnerabilities via LLMs and systematic validation of generated exploits. Using PoC-Gym, we evaluate whether the guidance from static analysis tools improves the PoC generation success rate and manually inspect the resulting PoCs.

Through Monte Carlo simulations, we generated incomplete data sets with three variables and assessed each imputation method within regression models. The results indicate that the linear regression based imputation method showed the best overall predictive performance (CV-MSE), whereas the sparse model approach was generally less efficient. Our findings underscore the relevance of extreme values when selecting an imputation strategy and highlight sample size, proportion of missingness, presence of extremes, and the type of fitted model as key determinants of performance. Despite its limitations, the study offers practical recommendations for researchers, stressing the need to examine the missingness mechanism and the occurrence of extreme values before choosing an imputation method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528R\u4e2dMICE\u5305\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u91cd\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u548c\u65e0\u6781\u7aef\u503c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9009\u62e9\u63d2\u8865\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u8981\u8003\u8651\u6781\u7aef\u503c\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u591a\u91cd\u63d2\u8865\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u91cd\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528R\u4e2d\u7684MICE\u5305\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u603b\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08CV - MSE\uff09\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u63d2\u8865\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u6781\u7aef\u503c\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3001\u6781\u7aef\u503c\u5b58\u5728\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u62df\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u8bae\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u524d\u68c0\u67e5\u7f3a\u5931\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u503c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

They are also interesting mathematical objects from the point of view of robust mean estimation. The Krum aggregation rule has been extensively studied, and endowed with formal robustness and convergence guarantees. Yet, MultiKrum, a natural extension of Krum, is often preferred in practice for its superior empirical performance, even though no theoretical guarantees were available until now. In this work, we provide the first proof that MultiKrum is a robust aggregation rule, and bound its robustness coefficient. To do so, we introduce $\u03ba^\\star$, the optimal *robustness coefficient* of an aggregation rule, which quantifies the accuracy of mean estimation in the presence of adversaries in a tighter manner compared with previously adopted notions of robustness. We then construct an upper and a lower bound on MultiKrum's robustness coefficient. As a by-product, we also improve on the best-known bounds on Krum's robustness coefficient. We show that MultiKrum's bounds are never worse than Krum's, and better in realistic regimes.

A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining.

Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

Among various approaches, database parameter tuning has proven to be a highly effective means of enhancing performance. Recent studies have shown that machine learning techniques can successfully optimize database parameters, leading to significant performance improvements. However, existing methods still face several limitations. First, they require substantial time to generate large training datasets. Second, to cope with the challenges of highdimensional optimization, they typically optimize only a subset of parameters rather than the full configuration space. Third, they often rely on information from similar workloads instead of directly leveraging information from the target workload. To address these limitations, we propose LatentTune, a novel approach that differs fundamentally from traditional methods. To reduce the time required for data generation, LatentTune incorporates a data augmentation strategy. Furthermore, it constructs a latent space that compresses information from all database parameters, enabling the optimization of the full configuration space. In addition, LatentTune integrates external metric information into the latent space, allowing for precise tuning tailored to the actual target workload.

To address this, we propose MiniRec, a data selection framework tailored for RL-based LLM recommendation. MiniRec evaluates sample learnability using key RL signals -- rewards -- pruning samples that are too easy (too high reward) or too difficult (consistently low reward). It assesses representativeness by aligning sample gradients with the approximated \"ideal\" global RL optimization trajectory, selecting samples that mainly drive model updates, and it also enforces diversity to reduce redundancy. Combined with a curriculum learning strategy from easy to hard samples, MiniRec significantly reduces training cost while largely preserving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate MiniRec's effectiveness, highlighting the importance of reward-aligned, trajectory-informed data selection in RL-based LLM recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMiniRec\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u8350\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMiniRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6837\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u201c\u7406\u60f3\u201d\u5168\u5c40\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ece\u6613\u5230\u96be\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Here, each voter independently reports a uniformly random preference order over the candidates. For a fixed committee size $k$, we ask when a committee can collectively beat every candidate outside the committee by a prescribed majority level $\u03b1$. We focus on two natural notions of collective dominance, $\u03b1$-winning and $\u03b1$-dominating sets, and we identify sharp threshold phenomena for both of them using probabilistic methods, duality arguments, and rounding techniques.\n  We first consider $\u03b1$-winning sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $\u03b1$-winning if, for every outside candidate $a \\notin S$, at least an $\u03b1$-fraction of voters rank some member of $S$ above $a$. We show a sharp threshold at \\[ \u03b1_{\\mathrm{win}}^\\star = 1 - \\frac{1}{k}. \\] Specifically, an $\u03b1$-winning set of size $k$ exists with high probability when $\u03b1< \u03b1_{\\mathrm{win}}^\\star$, and is unlikely to exist when $\u03b1> \u03b1_{\\mathrm{win}}^\\star$.\n  We then study the stronger notion of $\u03b1$-dominating sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $\u03b1$-dominating if, for every outside candidate $a \\notin S$, there exists a single committee member $b \\in S$ such that at least an $\u03b1$-fraction of voters prefer $b$ to $a$. Here we establish an analogous sharp threshold at \\[ \u03b1_{\\mathrm{dom}}^\\star = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2k}. \\] As a corollary, our analysis yields an impossibility result for $\u03b1$-dominating sets: for every $k$ and every $\u03b1> \u03b1_{\\mathrm{dom}}^\\star = 1 / 2 - 1 / (2k)$, there exist preference profiles that admit no $\u03b1$-dominating set of size $k$.

We present \\textbf{Active Epistemic Control (AEC)}, an epistemic-categorical planning layer that integrates model-based belief management with categorical feasibility checks. AEC maintains a strict separation between a \\emph{grounded fact store} used for commitment and a \\emph{belief store} used only for pruning candidate plans. At each step, it either queries the environment to ground an unresolved predicate when uncertainty is high or predictions are ambiguous, or simulates the predicate to filter hypotheses when confidence is sufficient.

We introduce a novel approach, SOGPTSpotter, that employs Siamese Neural Networks, leveraging the BigBird model and the Triplet loss, to detect ChatGPT-generated answers on Stack Overflow. We use triplets of human answers, reference answers, and ChatGPT answers. Our empirical evaluation reveals that our approach outperforms well-established baselines like GPTZero, DetectGPT, GLTR, BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 in identifying ChatGPT-synthesized Stack Overflow responses. We also conducted an ablation study to show the effectiveness of our model.

We develop NeuroPareto, a cohesive architecture that integrates rank-centric filtering, uncertainty disentanglement, and history-conditioned acquisition strategies to navigate complex objective landscapes. A calibrated Bayesian classifier estimates epistemic uncertainty across non-domination tiers, enabling rapid generation of high-quality candidates with minimal evaluation cost. Deep Gaussian Process surrogates further separate predictive uncertainty into reducible and irreducible components, providing refined predictive means and risk-aware signals for downstream selection. A lightweight acquisition network, trained online from historical hypervolume improvements, guides expensive evaluations toward regions balancing convergence and diversity. With hierarchical screening and amortized surrogate updates, the method maintains accuracy while keeping computational overhead low.

Quantum entanglement offers fundamentally stronger correlations than classically achievable without communication. Crucially, these correlations manifest instantaneously upon measurement, irrespective of the physical distance separating the systems. We investigate the application of shared entanglement to a dual-work optimization problem in a distributed system comprising two servers. The system must process both a continuously available, preemptible baseline task and incoming customer requests arriving in pairs. System performance is characterized by the trade-off between baseline task throughput and customer waiting time. We present a rigorous analytical model demonstrating that when the baseline task throughput function is strictly convex, rewarding longer uninterrupted processing periods, entanglement-assisted routing strategies achieve Pareto-superior performance compared to optimal communication-free classical strategies. We prove this advantage through queueing-theoretic analysis, non-local game formulation, and computational certification of classical bounds.

Recent training-free zero-shot methods often employ Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to compose a target image description for retrieval. However, due to the fuzzy matching nature of ZS-CIR, the generated description is prone to semantic bias relative to the target image. We propose SDR-CIR, a training-free Semantic Debias Ranking method based on CoT reasoning. First, Selective CoT guides the MLLM to extract visual content relevant to the modification text during image understanding, thereby reducing visual noise at the source. We then introduce a Semantic Debias Ranking with two steps, Anchor and Debias, to mitigate semantic bias. In the Anchor step, we fuse reference image features with target description features to reinforce useful semantics and supplement omitted cues. In the Debias step, we explicitly model the visual semantic contribution of the reference image to the description and incorporate it into the similarity score as a penalty term. By supplementing omitted cues while suppressing redundancy, SDR-CIR mitigates semantic bias and improves retrieval performance.

One of our algorithms also works for weighted BTT and for approximately optimal feasible solutions to the bad triangle cover LP. Using a recent result on approximating the bad triangle cover LP, we obtain a $(2+\u03b5)$ approximation in time almost equal to the time needed to find a maximal set of edge-disjoint bad triangles (which would give a standard 3-approximation). Additionally, several inapproximability results are provided. For complete signed graphs, we show that BTT is NP-hard to approximate with factor better than $\\frac{2137}{2136}$. Our reduction also implies the same hardness result for related problems such as correlation clustering (cluster editing), cluster deletion and the min. strong triadic closure problem. On complete signed graphs, BTT is closely related to correlation clustering.

In many reasoning systems, a large fraction of verifier calls are spent on redundant or unpromising intermediate hypotheses. We study reasoning under a \\emph{verification-cost-limited} setting and ask how verification effort should be allocated across intermediate states. We propose a state-level selective verification framework that combines (i) deterministic feasibility gating over a structured move interface, (ii) pre-verification ranking using a hybrid of learned state-distance and residual scoring, and (iii) adaptive allocation of verifier calls based on local uncertainty.

Unlike patchable software vulnerabilities, hardware trojans become irreversible once fabricated, making remediation extremely costly or impossible. Existing active defenses require access to training data, impractical for third-party LLM users, while passive defenses struggle against semantically stealthy triggers that naturally blend into design specifications. In this paper, we hypothesize that under the requirements of both effectiveness and stealthiness, attackers are strongly biased toward embedding triggers in non-functional requirements (e.g., style modifiers, quality descriptors) rather than functional specifications that determine hardware behavior. Exploiting this insight, we propose Semantic Consensus Decoding (SCD), an inference-time passive defense with two key components: (1) functional requirement extraction that identifies essential requirements from user specifications, and (2) consensus decoding that adaptively fuses output distributions based on full user specifications and extracted functional requirements. When these distributions diverge significantly, SCD automatically suppresses suspicious components. Extensive experiments with three representative backdoor attacks demonstrate that SCD reduces average attack success rate from 89% to under 3% with negligible impact on generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u5171\u8bc6\u89e3\u7801\uff08SCD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u9632\u5fa1Verilog\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8eVerilog\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u6613\u53d7\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u9632\u5fa1\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u88ab\u52a8\u9632\u5fa1\u96be\u5e94\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u9690\u853d\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u65b0\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u89c4\u8303\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u7528\u6237\u89c4\u8303\u4e0e\u63d0\u53d6\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u82e5\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u5219\u6291\u5236\u53ef\u7591\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cSCD\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece89%\u964d\u81f33%\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "SCD\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1Verilog\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u3002"}}

The looseness and estimator-dependent bias can make IB \"compression\" only indirectly controlled and optimization fragile.\n  We revisit the IB problem through the lens of information geometry and propose a \\textbf{Geo}metric \\textbf{I}nformation \\textbf{B}ottleneck (\\textbf{GeoIB}) that dispenses with mutual information (MI) estimation. We show that I(X;Z) and I(Z;Y) admit exact projection forms as minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances from the joint distributions to their respective independence manifolds. Guided by this view, GeoIB controls information compression with two complementary terms: (i) a distribution-level Fisher-Rao (FR) discrepancy, which matches KL to second order and is reparameterization-invariant; and (ii) a geometry-level Jacobian-Frobenius (JF) term that provides a local capacity-type upper bound on I(Z;X) by penalizing pullback volume expansion of the encoder. We further derive a natural-gradient optimizer consistent with the FR metric and prove that the standard additive natural-gradient step is first-order equivalent to the geodesic update. We conducted extensive experiments and observed that the GeoIB achieves a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane than the mainstream IB baselines on popular datasets.

The integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems has introduced critical safety concerns, particularly regarding driver re-engagement during mode transitions. Past accidents underscore the risks of overreliance on automation and highlight the need to understand dynamic attention allocation to support safety in autonomous driving. A high-fidelity driving simulation was conducted. Eye-tracking technology was used to measure fixation duration, fixation count, and time to first fixation across distinct driving modes (automated, manual, and transition), which were then used to assess how drivers allocated attention to various areas of interest (AOIs). Findings show that drivers' attention varies significantly across driving modes. In manual mode, attention consistently focuses on the road, while in automated mode, prolonged fixation on the embedded HMI was observed. During the handover and takeover phases, attention shifts dynamically between environmental and technological elements. The study reveals that driver attention allocation is mode-dependent. These findings inform the design of adaptive HMIs in AVs that align with drivers' attention patterns. By presenting relevant information according to the driving context, such systems can enhance driver-vehicle interaction, support effective transitions, and improve overall safety. Systematic analysis of visual attention dynamics across driving modes is gaining prominence, as it informs adaptive HMI designs and driver readiness interventions.

While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint.

By compiling different data sources, they reveal the uneven spatial distribution of knowledge, with areas or taxonomic groups better prospected than others. Understanding the determinants of spatial and taxonomic knowledge gaps helps in informing the use of open-access data. Here, we identified knowledge gaps' determinants within a French regional biodiversity database, in the largest administrative region in France. Knowledge gaps were assessed using two metrics, completeness and ignorance scores, for 8 taxonomic groups covering five vertebrates and three invertebrates groups. The data was analyzed for the entire region, but also at the level of the three former sub-regions, to identify the potential drivers that may account for knowledge gaps' determinants. Our findings show that invertebrates were characterized by higher knowledge gaps than vertebrates. Overall, knowledge gaps are influenced by variables related to sites' accessibility rather than ecological appeal across both metrics. All groups shared similar determinants of gaps, except for the impact of agricultural pressure which is found to be more significant for invertebrates than vertebrates. Ultimately, our study emphasizes the impact of biodiversity governance, through local funding and regional political decisions, on knowledge distribution in open-access databases. We recommend limiting these biases by redirecting biodiversity funding towards under-sampled taxonomic groups and under-prospected areas.

They not only incorporate open-world knowledge from large language models (LLMs) but also compress the semantic space to reduce generation difficulty. However, existing methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) the lack of contextual awareness in generation tasks leads to a gap between the Semantic ID codebook space and the generation space, resulting in suboptimal recommendations; and (2) suboptimal quantization methods exacerbate semantic loss in LLMs. To address these issues, we propose Dual-Flow Orthogonal Semantic IDs (DOS) method. Specifically, DOS employs a user-item dual flow-framework that leverages collaborative signals to align the Semantic ID codebook space with the generation space. Furthermore, we introduce an orthogonal residual quantization scheme that rotates the semantic space to an appropriate orientation, thereby maximizing semantic preservation. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate the effectiveness of DOS.

Random access to such strings in strongly sublogarithmic time is impossible in the worst case, but previous authors have shown how to support faster access to specific characters and their neighbourhoods. In this paper we explore whether, since better compression can impede access, we can support faster access to relatively incompressible substrings of highly compressed strings. We first show how, given a run-length compressed straight-line program (RLSLP) of size $g_{rl}$ or a block tree of size $L$, we can build an $O (g_{rl})$-space or an $O (L)$-space data structure, respectively, that supports access to any character in time logarithmic in the length of the longest repeated substring containing that character. That is, the more incongruous a character is with respect to the characters around it in a certain sense, the faster we can support access to it.

Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLOGO\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b56\u7565\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLOGO\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6d4b\u63a8\u65ad\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e0e8\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Recent work has reported that monitorability--the degree to which CoT faithfully and informatively reflects internal computation--can appear as a \"free gift\" during the early stages of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty. Together, these findings provide a holistic view of how monitorability emerges under RLVR, clarifying when gains are likely to occur and when they are not.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0LRMs\u5728RLVR\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u673a\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u75d5\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u9700\u660e\u786e\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u5728RLVR\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u673a\u68b0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u9510\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u96be\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u9762\u5448\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u5728RLVR\u4e2d\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4f55\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f55\u65f6\u4e0d\u4f1a\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a robust non-linear PCA framework that unifies the interpretability of PCA with the flexibility of neural networks. Our method parametrizes variable transformations via neural networks, optimized using Evolution Strategies (ES) to handle the non-differentiability of eigendecomposition. We introduce a novel, granular objective function that maximizes the individual variance contribution of each variable providing a stronger learning signal than global variance maximization. This approach natively handles categorical and ordinal variables without the dimensional explosion associated with one-hot encoding. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both linear PCA and kPCA in explained variance across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Prior work has shown that Pull Requests (PRs) produced using coding agents (Agentic-PRs) are accepted less often than PRs that are not labeled as agentic (Human-PRs). The rejection reasons for a single agent (Claude Code) have been explored, but a comparison of how rejection reasons differ between Agentic-PRs generated by different agents has not yet been performed. This comparison is important since different coding agents are often used for different purposes, which can lead to agent-specific failure patterns. In this paper, we inspect 654 rejected PRs from the AIDev dataset covering five coding agents, as well as a human baseline. Our results show that seven rejection modes occur only in Agentic-PRs, including distrust of AI-generated code. We also observe agent-specific patterns (e.g., automated withdrawal of inactive PRs by Devin), reflecting differences in how agents are configured and used in practice. Notably, a large proportion of rejected PRs (67.9%) lack explicit reviewer feedback, making their rejection reasons difficult to determine. To mitigate this issue, we propose a set of heuristics that reduce the proportion of such cases, offering a practical preprocessing step for future studies of PR rejection in agentic coding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7684PR\u88ab\u62d2\u539f\u56e0\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b07\u79cd\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u4e8eAgentic - PR\u7684\u62d2\u7b7e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u660e\u786e\u62d2\u56e0\u7684PR\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u51cf\u8f7b\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7528\u9014\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u672a\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7684Agentic - PR\u88ab\u62d2\u539f\u56e0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u68c0\u67e5\u6765\u81eaAIDev\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684654\u4e2a\u88ab\u62d2PR\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b07\u79cd\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u4e8eAgentic - PR\u7684\u62d2\u7b7e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982\u5bf9AI\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0d\u4fe1\u4efb\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b67.9%\u88ab\u62d2PR\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u7ec4\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u88ab\u62d2PR\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

While MCPs are typically estimated from high-dimensional gene expression data using methods like sparse principal component analysis or latent factor models, these approaches often suffer from high computational costs and limited statistical power. In this work, we propose Sparse Group Principal Component Analysis (SGPCA) to estimate MCPs by leveraging their inherent group and individual sparsity. We introduce an efficient double-thresholding algorithm based on power iteration. In each iteration, a group thresholding step first identifies relevant gene groups, followed by an individual thresholding step to select active cell types. This algorithm achieves a linear computational complexity of $O(np)$, making it highly efficient and scalable for large-scale genomic analyses.

This partial observability induces a generalization problem, which we analyze in a realizable, transductive setting.\n  We show that, when the reasoning probe is parameterized by a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based hypothesis class and queries $N$ nodes, the worst-case generalization error attains the optimal rate $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\log(2/\u03b4)}/\\sqrt{N})$ with probability at least $1-\u03b4$, for $\u03b4\\in (0,1)$.

We consider a coopetitive setting where the MaaS platform purchases service capacity from service operators and sells multi-modal trips to travelers following an origin-destination-based pricing scheme; meanwhile, service operators use their remaining capacities to serve single-modal trips. As followers, travelers make both mode choices, including whether to use MaaS, and route choices in the multi-modal transportation network, subject to prices and congestion. Inspired by the dual formulation for traffic assignment problems, we propose a novel single-level variational inequality (VI) formulation by introducing a virtual traffic operator, along with the MaaS platform and multiple service operators. A key advantage of the proposed VI formulation is that it supports parallel solution procedures and thus enables large-scale applications. We prove that an equilibrium solution always exists given the negotiated wholesale price of service capacity. Numerical experiments on a small network further demonstrate that the wholesale price can be tailored to align with varying system-wide objectives. The proposed MaaS system demonstrates potential for creating a \"win-win-win\" outcome -- service operators and travelers are better off compared to the \"without MaaS\" scenario, meanwhile the MaaS platform remains profitable. Such a Pareto-improving regime can be explicitly specified with the wholesale capacity price.

Yet modern AI systems increasingly operate within human decision loops, where users interpret and act on model recommendations. Large Language Models generate fluent natural-language explanations that shape how users perceive and trust AI outputs, revealing a new attack surface at the cognitive layer: the communication channel between AI and its users. We introduce adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs), where an attacker manipulates the framing of LLM-generated explanations to modulate human trust in incorrect outputs. We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions. To characterize this threat, we conducted a controlled experiment (n = 205), systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format. Our findings show that users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving the vast majority of benign trust despite being incorrect.

We present ProxyWar, a novel framework that systematically assesses code generation quality by embedding LLM-generated agents within diverse, competitive game environments. Unlike existing approaches, ProxyWar evaluates not only functional correctness but also the operational characteristics of generated programs, combining automated testing, iterative code repair, and multi-agent tournaments to provide a holistic view of program behavior. Applied to a range of state-of-the-art coders and games, our approach uncovers notable discrepancies between benchmark scores and actual performance in dynamic settings, revealing overlooked limitations and opportunities for improvement. These findings highlight the need for richer, competition-based evaluation of code generation. Looking forward, ProxyWar lays a foundation for research into LLM-driven algorithm discovery, adaptive problem solving, and the study of practical efficiency and robustness, including the potential for models to outperform hand-crafted agents.

Focusing on monthly and quarterly time series with at most 20 years of historical data, we evaluate whether a fully automatic, purely feedback-driven ESN can serve as a competitive alternative to widely used statistical forecasting methods. The study adopts a rigorous two-stage evaluation approach: a Parameter dataset is used to conduct an extensive hyperparameter sweep covering leakage rate, spectral radius, reservoir size, and information criteria for regularization, resulting in over four million ESN model fits; a disjoint Forecast dataset is then used for out-of-sample accuracy assessment. Forecast accuracy is measured using MASE and sMAPE and benchmarked against simple benchmarks like drift and seasonal naive and statistical models like ARIMA, ETS, and TBATS. The hyperparameter analysis reveals consistent and interpretable patterns, with monthly series favoring moderately persistent reservoirs and quarterly series favoring more contractive dynamics. Across both frequencies, high leakage rates are preferred, while optimal spectral radii and reservoir sizes vary with temporal resolution. In the out-of-sample evaluation, the ESN performs on par with ARIMA and TBATS for monthly data and achieves the lowest mean MASE for quarterly data, while requiring lower computational cost than the more complex statistical models. Overall, the results demonstrate that ESNs offer a compelling balance between predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, positioning them as a practical option for automated time series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528M4\u7ade\u8d5b\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u7814\u7a76\u56de\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ESNs\uff09\u5bf9\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eESNs\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u7eaf\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684ESNs\u80fd\u5426\u6210\u4e3a\u5e38\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u672c\u5916\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7528MASE\u548csMAPE\u8861\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u6790\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u5916\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2dESNs\u5bf9\u6708\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u8868\u73b0\u4e0eARIMA\u548cTBATS\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b63\u5ea6\u6570\u636eMASE\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ESNs\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Yet, current evaluations of reconstruction quality emphasize point-estimate accuracy metrics on a single sample, which do not reflect the stochastic nature of PnPDP solvers and the intrinsic uncertainty of inverse problems, critical for scientific tasks. This creates a fundamental mismatch: in inverse problems, the desired output is typically a posterior distribution and most PnPDP solvers induce a distribution over reconstructions, but existing benchmarks only evaluate a single reconstruction, ignoring distributional characterization such as uncertainty. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic study to benchmark the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of existing diffusion inverse solvers.

Although classical algorithms, e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, provide exact answers, their latency is prohibitive for modern real-time, large-scale deployments. Over the past two decades, numerous distance indexes have been proposed to speed up query processing for shortest distance queries. More recently, with the advancement in machine learning (ML), researchers have designed and proposed ML-based distance indexes to answer approximate shortest path and distance queries efficiently. However, a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these ML-based approaches is lacking. This paper presents the first empirical survey of ML-based distance indexes on road networks, evaluating them along four key dimensions: Training time, query latency, storage, and accuracy. Using seven real-world road networks and workload-driven query datasets derived from trajectory data, we benchmark ten representative ML techniques and compare them against strong classical non-ML baselines, highlighting key insights and practical trade-offs.

High- or low-quality agents arrive sequentially with one supply agent and one demand agent arriving in each period, and matching payoffs are supermodular. In the centralized benchmark, the optimal policy follows a threshold-based rule that rations high-quality supply, preserving it for future high-quality demand. In the decentralized system, where self-interested agents decide whether to match under an exogenously specified payoff allocation proportion, we characterize a welfare-maximizing Markov perfect equilibrium. Unlike outcomes in the centralized benchmark or in full-backlog markets, the equilibrium exhibits distinct matching patterns in which low-type demand may match with high-type supply even when low-type supply is available. Unlike settings in which both sides have long-lived agents and perfect coordination is impossible, the decentralized system can always be perfectly aligned with the centralized optimum by appropriately adjusting the allocation of matching payoffs across agents on both sides. Finally, when the arrival probabilities for H- and L-type arrivals are identical on both sides, we compare social welfare across systems with different patience levels: full backlog on both sides, one-sided backlog, and no backlog. In the centralized setting, social welfare is weakly ordered across systems. However, in the decentralized setting, the social welfare ranking across the three systems depends on the matching payoff allocation rule and the unit waiting cost, and enabling patience can either increase or decrease social welfare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u8fb9\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8010\u5fc3\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u798f\u5229\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u8010\u5fc3\u6c34\u5e73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u53cc\u8fb9\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8010\u5fc3\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4f18\u5316\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u518d\u5206\u6790\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u8010\u5fc3\u6c34\u5e73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u3002", "result": "\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u5747\u8861\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6536\u76ca\u5206\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u6700\u4f18\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u8010\u5fc3\u6c34\u5e73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u6392\u5e8f\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u4e2d\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u8fb9\u5e73\u53f0\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u8010\u5fc3\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6536\u76ca\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u8010\u5fc3\u6c34\u5e73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u53d7\u5339\u914d\u6536\u76ca\u5206\u914d\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u7b49\u5f85\u6210\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process.\n  This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them. Each family gives rise to a distinct type of counterfactual explanation, uncovering five fundamentally different types of counterfactuals. Some of these correspond to local explanations, while others capture global explanations. Finally, the framework situates existing explainers within this taxonomy, formally characterizes their behavior, and analyzes the computational complexity of generating such explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u516c\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u517c\u5bb9\u96c6\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e94\u79cd\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u66ff\u4ee3\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u586b\u8865\u6b64\u7a7a\u767d\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u60f3\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u516c\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u516c\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

The four-stage process of analysis, enrichment, synthesis, and transition systematically extracts, abstracts, and transforms system artifacts. We apply our approach to a large industrial application built on legacy versions of the .NET Framework and ASP.NET MVC and show that core user interface components and page structures can be migrated semi-automatically to a modern web stack while preserving functional behavior and essential non-functional qualities. By consolidating architectural knowledge into explicit model representations, the resulting codebase exhibits higher maintainability and extensibility, thereby improving developer experience. Although automation is effective for standard patterns, migration of bespoke layout composites remains challenging and requires targeted manual adaptation.

We propose a novel, lightweight framework that relaxes the strict requirements on Super-Structure construction while preserving the algorithmic benefits of divide-and-conquer. By integrating weakly constrained Super-Structures with efficient graph partitioning and merging strategies, our approach substantially lowers CI test overhead without sacrificing accuracy. We instantiate the framework in a concrete causal discovery algorithm and rigorously evaluate its components on synthetic data. Comprehensive experiments on Gaussian Bayesian networks, including magic-NIAB, ECOLI70, and magic-IRRI, demonstrate that our method matches or closely approximates the structural accuracy of PC and FCI while drastically reducing the number of CI tests. Further validation on the real-world China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset confirms its practical applicability.

In this paper, we introduce the R package mmcmcBayes, which implements a multistage Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure for region-level detection of differentially methylated regions. The method models sample-wise regional methylation summaries using the alpha-skew generalized normal distribution and evaluates evidence for differential methylation between groups through Bayes factors. We use a multistage region-splitting strategy to refine candidate regions based on statistical evidence. We describe the underlying methodology and software implementation, and illustrate its performance through simulation studies and applications to Illumina 450K methylation data.

Subgroup analysis allows practitioners to pinpoint populations for whom a treatment is especially beneficial or protective, thereby advancing targeted interventions. Tree based recursive partitioning methods are widely used for subgroup analysis due to their interpretability. Nevertheless, these approaches encounter significant limitations, including suboptimal partitions induced by greedy heuristics and overfitting from locally estimated splits, especially under limited sample sizes. To address these limitations, we propose a fused optimal causal tree method that leverages mixed integer optimization (MIO) to facilitate precise subgroup identification. Our approach ensures globally optimal partitions and introduces a parameter fusion constraint to facilitate information sharing across related subgroups. This design substantially improves subgroup discovery accuracy and enhances statistical efficiency. We provide theoretical guarantees by rigorously establishing out of sample risk bounds and comparing them with those of classical tree based methods.

However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings. In this work, we show that this limitation can be addressed through training. We introduce ORBIT, a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context. After meta-training, a relatively small open-source model (Qwen3-14B) demonstrates substantially improved in-context online learning on entirely unseen environments, matching the performance of GPT-5.2 and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning by a large margin.

Despite this potential, organizations face substantial challenges in assessing the risks associated with LLM use, resulting in inconsistent integration, unknown failure modes, and limited scalability. This paper introduces the LLM Risk Assessment Framework (LRF), a structured approach for evaluating the application of LLMs within Systems Engineering (SE) environments. The framework classifies LLM-based applications along two fundamental dimensions: autonomy, ranging from supportive assistance to fully automated decision making, and impact, reflecting the potential severity of incorrect or misleading model outputs on engineering processes and system elements. By combining these dimensions, the LRF enables consistent determination of corresponding risk levels across the development lifecycle. The resulting classification supports organizations in identifying appropriate validation strategies, levels of human oversight, and required countermeasures to ensure safe and transparent deployment. The framework thereby helps align the rapid evolution of AI technologies with established engineering principles of reliability, traceability, and controlled process integration. Overall, the LRF provides a basis for risk-aware adoption of LLMs in complex engineering environments and represents a first step toward standardized AI assurance practices in systems engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86LLM\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff08LRF\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u786e\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91c7\u53d6\u76f8\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u5730\u91c7\u7528LLM\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4f7f\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96c6\u6210\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165LRF\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6309\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u76f8\u5e94\u98ce\u9669\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u652f\u6301\u7ec4\u7ec7\u786e\u5b9a\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6240\u9700\u5bf9\u7b56\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u900f\u660e\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "LRF\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u5730\u91c7\u7528LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6807\u51c6\u5316AI\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

However, to translate this sparsity into practical performance, an expert caching mechanism is required. Previous works have proposed hardware-centric caching policies, but how these various caching policies interact with each other and different hardware specification remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we develop \\textbf{SpecMD}, a standardized framework for benchmarking ad-hoc cache policies on various hardware configurations. Using SpecMD, we perform an exhaustive benchmarking of several MoE caching strategies, reproducing and extending prior approaches in controlled settings with realistic constraints.

This paper studies the contextual bandit problem under a uniform $(1-\u03b4)$-fairness constraint, and addresses its unique vulnerabilities to strategic manipulation. The fairness constraint ensures that preferential treatment is strictly justified by an arm's actual reward across all contexts and time horizons, using uniformity to prevent statistical loopholes. We develop novel algorithms that achieve (nearly) minimax-optimal regret for both linear and smooth reward functions, while maintaining strong $(1-\\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness guarantees, and further characterize the theoretically inherent yet asymptotically marginal \"price of fairness\". However, we reveal that such merit-based fairness becomes uniquely susceptible to signal manipulation. We show that an adversary with a minimal $\\tilde{O}(1)$ budget can not only degrade overall performance as in traditional attacks, but also selectively induce insidious fairness-specific failures while leaving conspicuous regret measures largely unaffected. To counter this, we design robust variants incorporating corruption-adaptive exploration and error-compensated thresholding. Our approach yields the first minimax-optimal regret bounds under $C$-budgeted attack while preserving $(1-\\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness.

Yet, RAG was recently shown to be quite vulnerable to corpus knowledge poisoning: an attacker injects misleading documents to the corpus to steer an LLMs' output to an undesired response. We argue that the standard causal attention mechanism in LLMs enables harmful cross-document interactions, specifically in cases of attacks. Accordingly, we introduce a novel defense approach for RAG: Sparse Document Attention RAG (SDAG). This is a block-sparse attention mechanism that disallows cross-attention between retrieved documents. SDAG requires a minimal inference-time change to the attention mask; furthermore, no fine-tuning or additional architectural changes are needed. We present an empirical evaluation of LLM-based question answering (QA) with a variety of attack strategies on RAG. We show that our SDAG method substantially outperforms the standard causal attention mechanism in terms of attack success rate.

In this work, we study the automated design of agentic systems that remain safe even when a subset of agents is compromised. We formalize this challenge as a Stackelberg security game between a system designer (the Meta-Agent) and a best-responding Meta-Adversary that selects and compromises a subset of agents to minimize safety. We propose Meta-Adversary-Meta-Agent (MaMa), a novel algorithm for approximately solving this game and automatically designing safe agentic systems. Our approach uses LLM-based adversarial search, where the Meta-Agent iteratively proposes system designs and receives feedback based on the strongest attacks discovered by the Meta-Adversary. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that systems designed with MaMa consistently defend against worst-case attacks while maintaining performance comparable to systems optimized solely for task success.

The first relies on precomputed road costs for optimal routing and heuristic algorithms for generating alternatives, while the second, generative methods, has recently gained significant attention. However, the former struggles with personalization and route diversity, while the latter fails to meet the efficiency requirements of large-scale real-time scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose GenMRP, a generative framework for multi-route planning. To ensure generation efficiency, GenMRP first introduces a skeleton-to-capillary approach that dynamically constructs a relevant sub-network significantly smaller than the full road network. Within this sub-network, routes are generated iteratively. The first iteration identifies the optimal route, while the subsequent ones generate alternatives that balance quality and diversity using the newly proposed correctional boosting approach. Each iteration incorporates road features, user historical sequences, and previously generated routes into a Link Cost Model to update road costs, followed by route generation using the Dijkstra algorithm. Extensive experiments show that GenMRP achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency in both offline and online environments.

Here, we dissect this co-evolutionary feedback by coupling a public goods game with an epidemic model on complex networks, including multiplex and real-world networks. Our results reveals a dichotomy in how heterogeneity shapes outcomes. We demonstrate that structural heterogeneity in social networks acts as a powerful catalyst for cooperation and disease suppression. This emergent effect is driven by highly connected hubs who, facing amplified personal risk, adopt protective strategies out of self-interest. In contrast, heterogeneity in individual infection costs proves detrimental, undermining cooperation and amplifying the epidemic. This creates a ``weakest link'' problem, where individuals with low perceived risk act as persistent free-riders and disease reservoirs, degrading the collective response. Our findings establish that heterogeneity is a double-edged sword: its impact is determined by whether it creates an asymmetry of influence (leverage points) or an asymmetry of motivation (weakest links), recommending disease intervention policies that facilitate cooperative transition in hubs (strengthening the leverage point) and homogenize incentives to weakest links.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408\u516c\u5171\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u514d\u75ab\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u662f\u53cc\u5203\u5251\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5e72\u9884\u653f\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u660e\u786e\u7fa4\u4f53\u514d\u75ab\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u96c6\u4f53\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u91cc\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u91cd\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u4e0a\u8026\u5408\u516c\u5171\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\u4e0e\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5256\u6790\u5171\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\u6210\u672c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7834\u574f\u5408\u4f5c\u3001\u52a0\u5267\u75ab\u60c5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u662f\u53cc\u5203\u5251\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5f62\u6210\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8fd8\u662f\u52a8\u673a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5b9e\u65bd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u67a2\u7ebd\u8282\u70b9\u5408\u4f5c\u8f6c\u53d8\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u8584\u5f31\u73af\u8282\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u5e72\u9884\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

To unify this landscape, we introduce WIND, a single pre-trained foundation model capable of replacing specialized baselines across a vast array of tasks. Crucially, in contrast to previous atmospheric foundation models, we achieve this without any task-specific fine-tuning. To learn a robust, task-agnostic prior of the atmosphere, we pre-train WIND with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective, utilizing an unconditional video diffusion model to iteratively reconstruct atmospheric dynamics from a noisy state. At inference, we frame diverse domain-specific problems strictly as inverse problems and solve them via posterior sampling. This unified approach allows us to tackle highly relevant weather and climate problems, including probabilistic forecasting, spatial and temporal downscaling, sparse reconstruction and enforcing conservation laws purely with our pre-trained model. We further demonstrate the model's capacity to generate physically consistent counterfactual storylines of extreme weather events under global warming scenarios.

Social media often fuels the spread of conspiracies, primarily driven by two key actors: Superspreaders -- influential individuals disseminating conspiracy content at disproportionately high rates, and Bots -- automated accounts designed to amplify conspiracies strategically. To counter the spread of conspiracy theories, it is critical to both identify these actors and to better understand their behavior. However, a systematic analysis of these actors as well as real-world-applicable identification methods are still lacking. In this study, we leverage over seven million tweets from the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze key differences between Human Superspreaders and Bots across dimensions such as linguistic complexity, toxicity, and hashtag usage. Our analysis reveals distinct communication strategies: Superspreaders tend to use more complex language and substantive content while relying less on structural elements like hashtags and emojis, likely to enhance credibility and authority. By contrast, Bots favor simpler language and strategic cross-usage of hashtags, likely to increase accessibility, facilitate infiltration into trending discussions, and amplify reach. To counter both Human Superspreaders and Bots, we propose and evaluate 27 novel metrics for quantifying the severity of conspiracy theory spread. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of an adapted H-Index for computationally feasible identification of Human Superspreaders. By identifying behavioral patterns unique to Human Superspreaders and Bots as well as providing suitable identification methods, this study provides a foundation for mitigation strategies, including platform moderation policies, temporary and permanent account suspensions, and public awareness campaigns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u51a0\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u8d85700\u4e07\u6761\u63a8\u6587\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u7c7b\u8d85\u7ea7\u4f20\u64ad\u8005\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f20\u64ad\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa27\u79cd\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb\u7684H\u6307\u6570\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u8d85\u7ea7\u4f20\u64ad\u8005\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u5a01\u80c1\u793e\u4f1a\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u52a9\u957f\u5176\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4f20\u64ad\u8005\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u5206\u6790\u5173\u952e\u4f20\u64ad\u8005\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u627e\u5230\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u8d85700\u4e07\u6761\u65b0\u51a0\u75ab\u60c5\u63a8\u6587\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u8d85\u7ea7\u4f20\u64ad\u8005\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f3027\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u4f20\u64ad\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u7ea7\u4f20\u64ad\u8005\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u64ad\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684H\u6307\u6570\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u8d85\u7ea7\u4f20\u64ad\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5982\u5e73\u53f0\u5ba1\u6838\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u8d26\u53f7\u5c01\u7981\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u5ba3\u4f20\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002"}}

Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario. Our results highlight the potential for sustainable collaboration that preserves effective knowledge sharing between AI systems and human knowledge platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4e0e\u95ee\u7b54\u8bba\u575b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u987a\u5e8f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03AI\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e73\u53f0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u534f\u4f5c\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u7b54\u8bba\u575b\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u53c8\u4f1a\u5438\u5f15\u7528\u6237\u79bb\u5f00\u8bba\u575b\u7684\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u987a\u5e8f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9eStack Exchange\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5e38\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u80fd\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7ea6\u4e00\u534a\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e73\u53f0\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5408\u4f5c\u3001\u6709\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\\% improvement in alignment.

While the discrete solver's accuracy is controllable, the rate of convergence of the discretization error is governed by the intrinsic dimension of our data.

The key finding is a simple, tuning-free estimator of $\\text{OT}_c(\u03c1, \\hat\u03c1)$ that utilizes the semi-dual OT functional and, remarkably, requires no OT solver. Furthermore, we derive a fast intrinsic dimension estimator from the multi-scale decay of our sampling error estimator. This framework unlocks significant computational and statistical advantages in practice, enabling us to (i) quantify the convergence rate of the discretization error, (ii) calibrate the entropic regularization of Sinkhorn divergences to the data's intrinsic geometry, and (iii) introduce a novel, intrinsic-dimension-based Richardson extrapolation estimator that strongly debiases Wasserstein distance estimation.

However, most existing work relies on large-scale demonstrations from technical professionals and close monitoring of the training process. These are challenging for a layperson when they want to teach the agent new skills. To lower the barrier of teaching AI agents, we propose Interactive Policy Restructuring and Training (InterPReT), which takes user instructions to continually update the policy structure and optimize its parameters to fit user demonstrations. This enables end-users to interactively give instructions and demonstrations, monitor the agent's performance, and review the agent's decision-making strategies. A user study (N=34) on teaching an AI agent to drive in a racing game confirms that our approach yields more robust policies without impairing system usability, compared to a generic imitation learning baseline, when a layperson is responsible for both giving demonstrations and determining when to stop.

Current SE agents remain fundamentally reactive, making decisions mainly based on conversation history and the most recent response. However, this reactive design provides no explicit structure or persistent state within the agent's memory, making long-horizon reasoning challenging. As a result, SE agents struggle to maintain a coherent understanding across reasoning steps, adapt their hypotheses as new evidence emerges, or incorporate execution feedback into the mental reasoning model of the system state.\n  In this position paper, we argue that, to further advance SE agents, we need to move beyond reactive behavior toward a structured, state-aware, and execution-grounded reasoning. We outline how explicit structure, persistent and evolving state, and the integration of execution-grounded feedback can help SE agents perform more coherent and reliable reasoning in long-horizon tasks.

However, current approaches remain predominantly stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem instance and failing to mimic the empirical accumulation of wisdom characteristic of human problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empirical-MCTS, a dual-loop framework that transforms stateless search into a continuous, non-parametric learning process. The framework unifies local exploration with global memory optimization through two novel mechanisms: Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) and a Memory Optimization Agent. PE-EMP functions as a reflexive optimizer within the local search, utilizing pairwise feedback to dynamically synthesize adaptive criteria and evolve meta-prompts (system prompts) in real-time. Simultaneously, the Memory Optimization Agent manages a global repository as a dynamic policy prior, employing atomic operations to distill high-quality insights across problems. Extensive evaluations on complex reasoning benchmarks, including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex, demonstrate that Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents.

While prior work has focused on training-time regularization and low-order representation statistics, little is known about whether the geometric structure of learned embeddings provides reliable post-hoc signals of robustness. We propose a geometry-based diagnostic framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings and extracts two complementary invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy based on the reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian, and a local smoothness measure based on Ollivier--Ricci curvature. Across multiple architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks, we find that lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger OOD accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses further show that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial embedding statistics.

Using held out calibration data, conformal prediction and risk control can produce prediction sets that exhibit statistically valid error control in a computationally efficient manner. However, in the standard formulations, the error is only controlled on average over many possible calibration datasets of fixed size. In this paper, we extend the control to remain valid with high probability over a cumulatively growing calibration dataset at any time point.

However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

Additionally, through a detailed fairness audit, we identified an overall \"Socioeconomic Predictive Gradient,\" with a positive correlation between regional poverty level (r = -0.62) and the algorithm's AUC. In addition, we found that the model performed at its highest levels in the least affluent divisions (AUC 0.74) and decreased dramatically in the wealthiest divisions (AUC 0.66).

We study performative predictions that affect a sample (e.g., only existing users of an app) and/or the whole population (e.g., all potential app users). This raises the question of how well models generalize under performativity. For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory. We prove generalization bounds under performative effects on the sample, on the population, and on both. A key intuition behind our proofs is that in the worst case, the population negates predictions, while the sample deceptively fulfills them. We cast such self-negating and self-fulfilling predictions as min-max and min-min risk functionals in Wasserstein space, respectively. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between performatively changing the world and learning from it: the more a model affects data, the less it can learn from it. Moreover, our analysis results in a surprising insight on how to improve generalization guarantees by retraining on performatively distorted samples.

Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy. Together, these results establish a principled route for turning latent LLM assumptions into reliable strategies for uncertainty-aware planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPCE\u6846\u67b6\u5c06LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e94\u7528LLM\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7e41\u901a\u4fe1\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PCE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5047\u8bbe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u6536\u76ca\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\u5bf9\u8def\u5f84\u8bc4\u5206\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u884c\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0a\uff0cPCE\u5728\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u901a\u4fe1\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePCE\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793aPCE\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5f0f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "PCE\u4e3a\u5c06LLM\u6f5c\u5728\u5047\u8bbe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u53ef\u9760\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

While control theory gives safety guarantees for standard controller designs, the practical implementation of controllers in software introduces complexities that are often overlooked. Controllers are often designed in continuous space, while the software is executed in discrete space, undermining some of the theoretical guarantees. Despite extensive research on control theory and control modeling, little attention has been paid to the implementations of controllers and how their theoretical guarantees are ensured in real-world software systems. We investigate 184 real-world controller implementations in open-source robot software. We examine their application context, the implementation characteristics, and the testing methods employed to ensure correctness. We find that the implementations often handle discretization in an ad hoc manner, leading to potential issues with real-time reliability. Challenges such as timing inconsistencies, lack of proper error handling, and inadequate consideration of real-time constraints further complicate matters. Testing practices are superficial, no systematic verification of theoretical guarantees is used, leaving possible inconsistencies between expected and actual behavior.

Understanding this hypothesized use will help to understand how, and in what contexts, developers use type information; additionally, it may help to design better development tools and inform educational decisions. To provide this evidence, we conduct an eye tracking study with 26 undergraduate students to determine if they read type annotations during code comprehension and bug localization in the TypeScript language. We found that developers do not look directly at lines containing type annotations or type declarations more often when they are present, in either code summarization or bug localization tasks.

Thus, a shock to one token may result in significant and uncontrolled contagion effects. As the DeFi ecosystem becomes increasingly linked with traditional financial infrastructure through instruments, such as stablecoins, the risk posed by this dynamic demands more powerful quantification tools. We introduce DeXposure-FM, the first time-series, graph foundation model for measuring and forecasting inter-protocol credit exposure on DeFi networks, to the best of our knowledge. Employing a graph-tabular encoder, with pre-trained weight initialization, and multiple task-specific heads, DeXposure-FM is trained on the DeXposure dataset that has 43.7 million data entries, across 4,300+ protocols on 602 blockchains, covering 24,300+ unique tokens. The training is operationalized for credit-exposure forecasting, predicting the joint dynamics of (1) protocol-level flows, and (2) the topology and weights of credit-exposure links. The DeXposure-FM is empirically validated on two machine learning benchmarks; it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, including a graph foundation model and temporal graph neural networks. DeXposure-FM further produces financial economics tools that support macroprudential monitoring and scenario-based DeFi stress testing, by enabling protocol-level systemic-importance scores, sector-level spillover and concentration measures via a forecast-then-measure pipeline. Empirical verification fully supports our financial economics tools. The model and code have been publicly available.

The main computational tool in BPI, predictive Monte Carlo, is challenging to apply here as it requires simulating unmodeled covariates. We therefore pursue the asymptotic alternative, filling a gap in the theory for supervised settings by proving a predictive CLT under quasi-martingale conditions.

Unfortunately, CP uncertainty regions can grow significantly in long horizon missions, rendering the statistical guarantees uninformative. To that end, we propose infusing CP with geometric information via group-averaging of the pretrained predictor to distribute the non-conformity mass across the orbits. Each sample now is treated as a representative of an orbit, thus uncertainty can be mitigated by other samples entangled to it via the orbit inducing elements of the symmetry group. Our approach provably yields contracted non-conformity scores in increasing convex order, implying improved exponential-tail bounds and sharper conformal prediction sets in expectation, especially at high confidence levels.

In this paper, we introduce the targeted synthetic control (TSC) method, a new two-stage estimator that directly estimates the counterfactual outcome. Specifically, our TSC method (1) yields a targeted debiasing estimator, in the sense that the targeted updating refines the initial weights to produce more stable weights; and (2) ensures that the final counterfactual estimation is a convex combination of observed control outcomes to enable direct interpretation of the synthetic control weights. TSC is flexible and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models. Methodologically, TSC starts from an initial set of synthetic-control weights via a one-dimensional targeted update through the weight-tilting submodel, which calibrates the weights to reduce bias of weights estimation arising from pre-treatment fit. Furthermore, TSC avoids key shortcomings of existing methods (e.g., the augmented SCM), which can produce unbounded counterfactual estimates.

Our central finding is negative: even when CoT is verbose, strategic, and flagged by surface-level manipulation detectors, model answers are often causally independent of the CoT content. We present a diagnostic framework for auditing this failure mode: it combines (i) an interpretable behavioral module that scores manipulation-relevant signals in CoT text and (ii) a causal probe that measures CoT-mediated influence (CMI) via hidden-state patching and reports a bypass score ($1-\\mathrm{CMI}$), quantifying the degree to which the answer is produced by a bypass circuit independent of the rationale. In pilot evaluations, audit-aware prompting increases detectable manipulation signals (mean risk-score delta: $+5.10$), yet causal probes reveal task-dependent mediation: many QA items exhibit near-total bypass (CMI $\\approx 0$), while some logic problems show stronger mediation (CMI up to $0.56$).

In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \\textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.\n  Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution.

We introduce a mathematically tractable framework for studying multi-modal learning and explore when transformer-like architectures can recover Bayes-optimal performance in-context. To model multi-modal problems, we assume the observed data arises from a latent factor model. Our first result comprises a negative take on expressibility: we prove that single-layer, linear self-attention fails to recover the Bayes-optimal predictor uniformly over the task distribution. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, linearized cross-attention mechanism, which we study in the regime where both the number of cross-attention layers and the context length are large. We show that this cross-attention mechanism is provably Bayes optimal when optimized using gradient flow. Our results underscore the benefits of depth for in-context learning and establish the provable utility of cross-attention for multi-modal distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7c7bTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5355\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u6570\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u90fd\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5355\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7edf\u4e00\u6062\u590d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6548\u7528\u3002"}}

Reported studies demonstrate competence on various tasks ranging from EHR analysis and differential diagnosis to treatment planning and research workflows.

Using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and a labeling rubric (Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Not Implemented), we map each study to the taxonomy and report quantitative summaries of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns. Our empirical analysis surfaces clear asymmetries.

Constraints from inference latency in scalable serving and fine-tuning cost in edge or rapid-deployment settings make the choice of which layers to fine-tune unavoidable. Yet current practice typically applies PEFT uniformly across all layers, with limited understanding or leverage of layer selection. This paper develops a unified projected residual view of PEFT on top of a frozen base model. Under a local quadratic approximation, layerwise adaptation is governed by three quantities: (i) the projected residual norm (resnorm), which measures how much correctable bias a layer can capture; (ii) the activation energy, which determines feature conditioning; and (iii) layer coupling, which quantifies how strongly residuals interact across layers. We show that, for squared loss and linear adapters, the resnorm equals a normalized gradient norm, activation energy controls ill-conditioning and noise amplification, and weak coupling yields approximately additive layerwise contributions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Layer Card, a reusable diagnostic that summarizes residual signal strength, compute cost, and performance for each layer of a given model. With an identical model and LoRA configuration, Layer Card-guided placement refines the choice of adapted layers to flexibly prioritize different objectives, such as maximizing performance or reducing fine-tuning cost. Moreover, on Qwen3-8B, we show that selectively adapting a subset of layers can achieve performance close to full-layer LoRA while substantially reducing fine-tuning cost and the number of adapter-augmented layers during inference, offering a more cost-performance-aware alternative to full-layer insertion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u6210\u4e0b\u6e38\u9002\u914d\u9ed8\u8ba4\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6295\u5f71\u6b8b\u5dee\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Layer Card\u6307\u5bfc\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728Qwen3 - 8B\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5c42\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0cPEFT\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u7edf\u4e00\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u8981\u6c42\u9009\u62e9\u5fae\u8c03\u5c42\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u6295\u5f71\u6b8b\u5dee\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8c\u6b21\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5c42\u9002\u914d\u53d7\u6295\u5f71\u6b8b\u5dee\u8303\u6570\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u5c42\u8026\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Layer Card\u603b\u7ed3\u5404\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen3 - 8B\u4e0a\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9002\u914d\u90e8\u5206\u5c42\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u5c42LoRA\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u5c42\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Layer Card\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c42\u63d2\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u6210\u672c - \u6027\u80fd\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our primary contribution is GroupCLIP, a novel group-level contrastive loss that bridges the gap between CLIP for paired cross-modal data and SupCon for uni-modal supervised contrastive learning, addressing a fundamental gap in contrastive learning for weakly-paired settings. We integrate GroupCLIP with an on-the-fly backtranslating autoencoder framework to encourage cross-modally entangled representations while maintaining group-level coherence within a shared latent space. Critically, we introduce a comprehensive combinatorial evaluation framework that systematically assesses representation learners across multiple optimal transport aligners, addressing key limitations in existing evaluation strategies. This framework includes novel simulations that systematically vary shared versus modality-specific perturbation effects enabling principled assessment of method robustness. Our combinatorial benchmarking reveals that there is not yet an aligner that uniformly dominates across settings or modality pairs. Across simulations and two real single-cell genetic perturbation datasets, GROOVE performs on par with or outperforms existing approaches for downstream cross-modal matching and imputation tasks.

We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGroup - Evolving Agents (GEA) \u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GEA\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u4e00\u7ec4\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u8fdb\u5316\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5185\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGEA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u9876\u7ea7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u5316\u65e9\u671f\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "GEA\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Malicious behavior is injected as cross-component logical perturbations that violate structural norms of strongly connected components(SCCs). We apply theoretical guarantees from opinion dynamics literature to determine topic convergence and detect anomaly via scaled opinion variance.

On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning.

This paper presents a data set created by merging the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets to augment sample counts and improve model accuracy. We evaluate the merged dataset using two state of the art relationship extraction algorithms: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) specifically BioBERT, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) combined with BioBERT. While BioBERT excels at capturing local contexts, it may benefit from incorporating global information essential for understanding chemical-gene interactions.

Substantial progress has been made through domain representation learning to capture domain-specific information, thus enabling domain-aware decision making. We analyze the process of learning domain representations through dynamical prediction and find that selecting contexts adjacent to the current step causes the learned representations to entangle static domain information with varying dynamical properties. Such mixture can confuse the conditioned policy, thereby constraining zero-shot adaptation. To tackle the challenge, we propose DADP (Domain Adaptive Diffusion Policy), which achieves robust adaptation through unsupervised disentanglement and domain-aware diffusion injection. First, we introduce Lagged Context Dynamical Prediction, a strategy that conditions future state estimation on a historical offset context; by increasing this temporal gap, we unsupervisedly disentangle static domain representations by filtering out transient properties. Second, we integrate the learned domain representations directly into the generative process by biasing the prior distribution and reformulating the diffusion target. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across locomotion and manipulation demonstrate the superior performance, and the generalizability of DADP over prior methods.

The second phase, Candidate Question Proposing, utilizes this synthesized data to prompt an ensemble of six diverse LLMs to propose an initial candidate pool, filtered via a cross-model voting mechanism. The third phase, Hybrid Question Selection, refines this pool through a multi-stage filtering process that progressively increases human oversight. To validate this system, we conducted an experiment aiming to identify the Top 10 Scientific Breakthroughs of 2025 and the Top 10 Scientific Questions for 2026 across five major disciplines.

Yet, despite these advances, critical challenges remain -- most notably, ensuring robustness to small input perturbations and generalization to out-of-distribution data. These critical challenges underscore the need to understand the underlying fundamental principles that govern robustness and generalization. Among the theoretical tools available, Lipschitz continuity plays a pivotal role in governing the fundamental properties of neural networks related to robustness and generalization. It quantifies the worst-case sensitivity of network's outputs to small input perturbations. While its importance is widely acknowledged, prior research has predominantly focused on empirical regularization approaches based on Lipschitz constraints, leaving the underlying principles less explored. This thesis seeks to advance a principled understanding of the principles of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks within the paradigm of machine learning, examined from two complementary perspectives: an internal perspective -- focusing on the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks during training (i.e., training dynamics); and an external perspective -- investigating how Lipschitz continuity modulates the behavior of neural networks with respect to features in the input data, particularly its role in governing frequency signal propagation (i.e., modulation of frequency signal propagation).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u6210\u529f\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dLipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u539f\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u7406\u89e3Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u6b64\u524d\u8be5\u539f\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5185\u90e8\uff08\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u548c\u5916\u90e8\uff08\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u8c03\u5236\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dLipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u539f\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca"}}

Synthetic validation confirms that SEIS correctly recovers known transformations. Applied to trained classification networks, SEIS reveals a transition from equivariance in early layers to invariance in deeper layers, and that data augmentation increases invariance while preserving equivariance.

Here, we present MILCCI, a novel data-driven method that i) identifies the interpretable components underlying the data, ii) captures cross-trial variability, and iii) integrates label information to understand each category's representation within the data. MILCCI extends a sparse per-trial decomposition that leverages label similarities within each category to enable subtle, label-driven cross-trial adjustments in component compositions and to distinguish the contribution of each category. MILCCI also learns each component's corresponding temporal trace, which evolves over time within each trial and varies flexibly across trials.

Artificial intelligence-powered cognitive behavioral therapy chatbots (AI-CBT) offer low barrier help, but little is known about how Chinese postgraduates perceive and use them.

Semi-structured Zoom interviews were conducted and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis, with the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as sensitizing frameworks. The findings indicate a cautious openness to AI-CBT chatbots: perceived usefulness and 24/7 access supported favorable attitudes, while data privacy, emotional safety, and uncertainty about `fit' for complex problems restricted the intention to use. Social norms (e.g., stigma and peer views) and perceived control (digital literacy, language quality) further shaped adoption.

In addition, we characterize the conditions under which this trade-off becomes strict, providing a guide for trade-off selection in practice. Based on the theoretical characterization, we develop an empirical regularizer based on conditional mutual information (CMI) between predictions and sensitive attributes given the true outcome. The CMI regularizer is compatible with any deep model trained via gradient-based optimization and serves as a scalar monitor of residual separation violations, offering tractable guarantees during training.

These results establish a universality principle for spiked tensor models, demonstrating that their high-dimensional spectral behavior and statistical limits are robust to non-Gaussian noise.\n  Our analysis relies on resolvent methods from random matrix theory, cumulant expansions valid under finite moment assumptions, and variance bounds based on Efron-Stein-type arguments.

This paper presents a benchmarking framework for evaluating ASR performance in agricultural contexts across Hindi, Telugu, and Odia languages. We introduce evaluation metrics including Agriculture Weighted Word Error Rate (AWWER) and domain-specific utility scoring to complement traditional metrics. Our evaluation of 10,934 audio recordings, each transcribed by up to 10 ASR models, reveals performance variations across languages and models, with Hindi achieving the best overall performance (WER: 16.2%) while Odia presents the greatest challenges (best WER: 35.1%, achieved only with speaker diarization). We characterize audio quality challenges inherent to real-world agricultural field recordings and demonstrate that speaker diarization with best-speaker selection can substantially reduce WER for multi-speaker recordings (upto 66% depending on the proportion of multi-speaker audio). We identify recurring error patterns in agricultural terminology and provide practical recommendations for improving ASR systems in low-resource agricultural domains.

Current interpretability approaches rely on internal metrics and lack external validation. Here we present the Brain-LLM Unified Model (BLUM), a framework that leverages lesion-symptom mapping, the gold standard for establishing causal brain-behavior relationships for over a century, as an external reference structure for evaluating LLM perturbation effects. Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns. These findings open a new methodological avenue for LLM interpretability in which clinical neuroscience provides external validation, establishing human lesion-symptom mapping as a reference framework for evaluating artificial language systems and motivating direct investigation of whether behavioral alignment reflects shared computational principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBrain - LLM Unified Model (BLUM)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u98ce\u540e\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u6270\u52a8\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5fc5\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBLUM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u75c5\u53d8 - \u75c7\u72b6\u6620\u5c04\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u7528\u4e2d\u98ce\u540e\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u75c7\u72b6 - \u75c5\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u7ed9\u53d7\u6270\u52a8LLM\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u540c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06LLM\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u6295\u5c04\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u75c5\u53d8\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "LLM\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8db3\u591f\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u572867%\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u547d\u540d\u548c68.3%\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u5b8c\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u75c5\u53d8\u4e0e\u5339\u914d\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9645\u75c5\u53d8\u9ad8\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u5e94\u8179\u4fa7\u6d41\u75c5\u53d8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u97f3\u4f4d\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u5e94\u80cc\u4fa7\u6d41\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3aLLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4eba\u7c7b\u75c5\u53d8 - \u75c7\u72b6\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u5de5\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u662f\u5426\u53cd\u6620\u5171\u4eab\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

We argue for adopting a probabilistic approach for approximating waves in high-frequency regime, and develop our probabilistic framework using a score-based conditional diffusion operator. After demonstrating a stability analysis of the Helmholtz operator, we present our numerical experiments across a wide range of frequencies, benchmarked against other popular data-driven and machine learning approaches for waves. We show that our probabilistic neural operator consistently produces robust predictions with the lowest errors in $L^2$, $H^1$, and energy norms. Moreover, unlike all the other tested deterministic approaches, our framework remarkably captures uncertainties in the input sound speed map propagated to the solution field.

In this work, we explore a solvable model of optimal learning rate schedules for a powerlaw random feature model trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We consider the optimal schedule $\u03b7_T^\\star(t)$ where $t$ is the current iterate and $T$ is the total training horizon. This schedule is computed both numerically and analytically (when possible) using optimal control methods. Our analysis reveals two regimes which we term the easy phase and hard phase. In the easy phase the optimal schedule is a polynomial decay $\u03b7_T^\\star(t) \\simeq T^{-\u03be} (1-t/T)^\u03b4$ where $\u03be$ and $\u03b4$ depend on the properties of the features and task. In the hard phase, the optimal schedule resembles warmup-stable-decay with constant (in $T$) initial learning rate and annealing performed over a vanishing (in $T$) fraction of training steps. We investigate joint optimization of learning rate and batch size, identifying a degenerate optimality condition. Our model also predicts the compute-optimal scaling laws (where model size and training steps are chosen optimally) in both easy and hard regimes. Going beyond SGD, we consider optimal schedules for the momentum $\u03b2(t)$, where speedups in the hard phase are possible. We compare our optimal schedule to various benchmarks in our task including (1) optimal constant learning rates $\u03b7_T(t) \\sim T^{-\u03be}$ (2) optimal power laws $\u03b7_T(t) \\sim T^{-\u03be} t^{-\u03c7}$, finding that our schedule achieves better rates than either of these.

Yet, FL lacks interpretable modeling paradigms. Integrating CMs with FL is non-trivial: CMs assume a fixed concept space and a predefined model architecture, whereas real-world FL is heterogeneous and non-stationary, with institutions joining over time and bringing new supervision. In this work, we propose Federated Concept-based Models (F-CMs), a new methodology for deploying CMs in evolving FL settings.

Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF.

While classical quickest change detection methods provide strong guarantees on detection delay and false-alarm rates, existing approaches for point-process data predominantly focus on temporal changes and do not explicitly infer affected spatial regions. We propose a likelihood-free, score-based detection framework that jointly estimates the change time and the change region in continuous space-time without assuming parametric knowledge of the pre- or post-change dynamics. The method leverages a localized and conditionally weighted Hyv\u00e4rinen score to quantify event-level deviations from nominal behavior and aggregates these scores using a spatio-temporal CUSUM-type statistic over a prescribed class of spatial regions. Operating sequentially, the procedure outputs both a stopping time and an estimated change region, enabling real-time detection with spatial interpretability.

TruKAN replaces the B-spline basis in KAN with a family of truncated power functions derived from k-order spline theory. This change maintains the KAN's expressiveness while enhancing accuracy and training time. Each TruKAN layer combines a truncated power term with a polynomial term and employs either shared or individual knots. TruKAN exhibits greater interpretability than other KAN variants due to its simplified basis functions and knot configurations. By prioritizing interpretable basis functions, TruKAN aims to balance approximation efficacy with transparency. We develop the TruKAN model and integrate it into an advanced EfficientNet-V2-based framework, which is then evaluated on computer vision benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair comparison, we develop various models: MLP-, KAN-, SineKAN and TruKAN-based EfficientNet frameworks and assess their training time and accuracy across small and deep architectures. The training phase uses hybrid optimization to improve convergence stability. Additionally, we investigate layer normalization techniques for all the models and assess the impact of shared versus individual knots in TruKAN.

However, recent evidence shows that perplexity can be unreliable, especially when irrelevant long inputs are used, raising concerns for both benchmarking and system deployment. While prior efforts have employed selective input filtering and curated datasets, the impact of input length on perplexity has not been systematically studied from a systems perspective and input length has rarely been treated as a first-class system variable affecting both fairness and efficiency. In this work, we close this gap by introducing LengthBenchmark, a system-conscious evaluation framework that explicitly integrates input length, evaluation protocol design, and system-level costs, evaluating representative LLMs under two scoring protocols (direct accumulation and fixed window sliding) across varying context lengths. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on accuracy-oriented metrics, LengthBenchmark additionally measures latency, memory footprint, and evaluation cost, thereby linking predictive metrics to deployment realities. We further incorporate quantized variants not as a main contribution, but as robustness checks, showing that length-induced biases persist across both full-precision and compressed models. This design disentangles the effects of evaluation logic, quantization, and input length, and demonstrates that length bias is a general phenomenon that undermines fair cross-model comparison.

Data-driven discovery methods address this challenge by inferring governing equations from time-series data using a library of functions constructed from the measured variables. However, these methods typically assume time-invariant coefficients, which limits their ability to capture evolving system dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we allow some of the parameters to vary over time, learn their temporal evolution directly from data, and infer a system of equations that incorporates both constant and time-varying parameters. We then transform this framework into a forecasting model by predicting the time-varying parameters and substituting these predictions into the learned equations. The model is validated using datasets for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, Consumer--Resource, greenhouse gas concentration, and Cyanobacteria cell count. By dynamically adapting to temporal shifts, our proposed model achieved a mean absolute error below 3\\% for learning a time series and below 6\\% for forecasting up to a month ahead.

The semantic pathway extracts high-level information by identifying the content within the audio, such as speech, music, or specific sound events. The dynamic pathway employs a frequency-adaptive mechanism as time evolves to jointly model these dynamics, enabling it to identify transient acoustic events via salient spectral bands and rapid energy changes.

However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities.

Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement.

We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences.

Previous works have leveraged Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to impose hard synthesizability constraints through the design of state and action spaces based on predefined reaction templates and building blocks. Despite the promising prospects of this approach, it currently lacks flexibility and scalability. As an alternative, we propose S3-GFN, which generates synthesizable SMILES molecules via simple soft regularization of a sequence-based GFlowNet.

While Molecular Dynamics (MD) is essential for elucidating this transduction process, particularly within ligand-bound complexes, conventional all-atom MD simulation is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we introduce GPCRLMD, a deep generative framework for efficient all-atom GPCR-ligand simulation.GPCRLMD employs a Harmonic-Prior Variational Autoencoder (HP-VAE) to first map the complex into a regularized isometric latent space, preserving geometric topology via physics-informed constraints. Within this latent space, a Residual Latent Flow samples evolution trajectories, which are subsequently decoded back to atomic coordinates. By capturing temporal dynamics via relative displacements anchored to the initial structure, this residual mechanism effectively decouples static topology from dynamic fluctuations.

However, the role of the discount factor is often overlooked, as it is typically treated as a fixed parameter of the Markov decision process or tunable hyperparameter, with little consideration of its effect on the learned policy. In the literature, it is well-known that the discounting function plays a major role in characterizing time preferences of an agent, which an exponential discount factor cannot fully capture. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that supports flexible discounting of future rewards and optimization of risk measures in distributional RL. We provide a technical analysis of the optimality of our algorithms, show that our multi-horizon extension fixes issues raised with existing methodologies, and validate the robustness of our methods through extensive experiments.

Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions.

While post-training quantization (PTQ) maintains high fidelity at 4-bit, it deteriorates at 2-3 bits. Fundamentally, existing methods enforce a shape-invariant quantization grid (e.g., the fixed uniform intervals of UINT2) for each group, severely restricting the feasible set for error minimization. To address this, we propose Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ), which constructs a variable quantization grid via bit-planes and scalar coefficients, and iteratively refines them using approximate second-order information while progressively compensating quantization errors to minimize output discrepancy.

Unlike existing methods that require the embedding dimension to be set apriori, LORE regularizes the solution using the nonconvex Schatten-$p$ quasi norm, enabling automatic joint recovery of both the ordinal embedding and its dimensionality. We optimize this joint objective via an iteratively reweighted algorithm and establish convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, simulated perceptual spaces, and real world crowdsourced ordinal judgements show that LORE learns compact, interpretable and highly accurate low dimensional embeddings that recover the latent geometry of subjective percepts.

We study how the linguistic characteristics of clinical decisions vary across decision categories and whether these differences explain extraction failures. Using MedDec discharge summaries annotated with decision categories from the Decision Identification and Classification Taxonomy for Use in Medicine (DICTUM), we compute seven linguistic indices for each decision span and analyze span-level extraction recall of a standard transformer model. We find clear category-specific signatures: drug-related and problem-defining decisions are entity-dense and telegraphic, whereas advice and precaution decisions contain more narrative, with higher stopword and pronoun proportions and more frequent hedging and negation cues. On the validation split, exact-match recall is 48%, with large gaps across linguistic strata: recall drops from 58% to 24% from the lowest to highest stopword-proportion bins, and spans containing hedging or negation cues are less likely to be recovered. Under a relaxed overlap-based match criterion, recall increases to 71%, indicating that many errors are span boundary disagreements rather than complete misses.

Existing approaches often struggle to generalize across trajectories and parameter settings, or rely on discretization-tied decoders that do not naturally transfer across meshes and resolutions. We propose STRIDE (Spatio-Temporal Recurrent Implicit DEcoder), a two-stage framework that maps a short window of sensor measurements to a latent state with a temporal encoder and reconstructs the field at arbitrary query locations with a modulated implicit neural representation (INR) decoder. Using the Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN) as the INR backbone improves representation of complex spatial fields and yields more stable optimization than sine-based INRs. We provide a conditional theoretical justification: under stable delay observability of point measurements on a low-dimensional parametric invariant set, the reconstruction operator factors through a finite-dimensional embedding, making STRIDE-type architectures natural approximators.

We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence to show the necessity of a more sufficient safe reasoning process to defend against advanced attack prompts. Building on this insight, we propose a Risk-Aware Preference Optimization (RAPO) framework that enables LRM to adaptively identify and address the safety risks with appropriate granularity in its thinking content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO successfully generalizes multiple LRMs' safe reasoning adaptively across diverse attack prompts whilst preserving general utility, contributing a robust alignment technique for LRM safety.

Given the rapid pace of AI development, the preprint ecosystem has become a critical barometer for real-time scientific shifts, often preceding formal peer-reviewed publication by months or years. By employing a multi-stage data collection and enrichment pipeline in conjunction with LLM-based institution classification, we analyze the evolution of publication volumes, author team sizes, and academic--industry collaboration patterns. Our results reveal an unprecedented surge in publication output following the introduction of ChatGPT, with academic institutions continuing to provide the largest volume of research. However, we observe that academic--industry collaboration is still suppressed, as measured by a Normalized Collaboration Index (NCI) that remains significantly below the random-mixing baseline across all major subfields.

Hence, incomplete verifiers are widely used because they scale efficiently and substantially reduce the cost of robustness verification compared to complete methods. However, relying on a single verifier can underestimate robustness because of loose approximations or misalignment with training methods. In this work, we propose Cascading Robustness Verification (CRV), which goes beyond an engineering improvement by exposing fundamental limitations of existing robustness metric and introducing a framework that enhances both reliability and efficiency. CRV is a model-agnostic verifier, meaning that its robustness guarantees are independent of the model's training process. The key insight behind the CRV framework is that, when using multiple verification methods, an input is certifiably robust if at least one method certifies it as robust. Rather than relying solely on a single verifier with a fixed constraint set, CRV progressively applies multiple verifiers to balance the tightness of the bound and computational cost. Starting with the least expensive method, CRV halts as soon as an input is certified as robust; otherwise, it proceeds to more expensive methods. For computationally expensive methods, we introduce a Stepwise Relaxation Algorithm (SR) that incrementally adds constraints and checks for certification at each step, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRV achieves equal or higher verified accuracy compared to powerful but computationally expensive incomplete verifiers in the cascade, while significantly reducing verification overhead. Empirical results confirm that CRV certifies at least as many inputs as benchmark approaches, while improving runtime efficiency by up to ~90%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea7\u8054\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1(CRV)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5e73\u8861\u7ea6\u675f\u7d27\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9010\u6b65\u677e\u5f1b\u7b97\u6cd5(SR)\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4e\u4f30\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCRV\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u6700\u4fbf\u5b9c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u82e5\u8f93\u5165\u88ab\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u5219\u505c\u6b62\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u7528\u66f4\u6602\u8d35\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165SR\u7b97\u6cd5\u9010\u6b65\u6dfb\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eCRV\u4e0e\u7ea7\u8054\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9eCRV\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u91cf\u4e0d\u5c11\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u7ea690%\u3002", "conclusion": "CRV\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

But what about contexts that are not novel but merely infrequent? In hierarchical regression, the model's predictions for behavior in a context are affected by observations from other similar contexts to the extent that 1) the current context is infrequent and 2) different contexts behave similarly. This is called adaptive partial pooling of evidence. This paper shows that next-word predictions of a transformer (GPT2) are increasingly unaffected by observations from outside the current context across epochs of training (the amount of pooling reduces with training), and that the extent of pooling is affected by context frequency, context number (type frequency) and context variability in a similar way to hierarchical regression.

We provide a two-fold theoretical foundation for our approach. First, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the local derivative, proving it remains strictly bounded away from zero. This directly addresses the root cause of gradient stagnation; empirically, our architecture reduces ``dead'' neurons from 90\\% in standard deep networks to less than 5\\%, outperforming ReLU, Leaky ReLU, SeLU, and GeLU. Second, we establish that the approximation error for Bernstein-based networks decays exponentially with depth, a significant improvement over the polynomial rates of ReLU-based architectures.

FI-Conv is built on a U-Net architecture, in which most convolutional layers are replaced by ConvNeXt V2 blocks. This design preserves U-Net performance on inputs with high-frequency variations while maintaining low computational complexity. FI-Conv uses an initial state, PDE parameters, and evolution time as input to predict the system future state. As a representative example of a system exhibiting complex dynamics, we evaluate the performance of FI-Conv on the task of predicting turbulent plasma fields governed by the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations. The HW system models two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence and exhibits strongly nonlinear behavior, making accurate approximation and long-term prediction particularly challenging. Using an autoregressive forecasting procedure, FI-Conv achieves accurate forward prediction of the plasma state evolution over short times (t ~ 3) and captures the statistic properties of derived physical quantities of interest over longer times (t ~ 100). Moreover, we develop a gradient-descent-based inverse estimation method that accurately infers PDE parameters from plasma state evolution data, without modifying the trained model weights. Collectively, our results demonstrate that FI-Conv can be an effective alternative to existing physics-informed machine learning methods for systems with complex spatio-temporal dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFI - Conv\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6b63\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6e4d\u6d41\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u573a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u6e4d\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eU - Net\u67b6\u6784\u7684FI - Conv\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u66ff\u6362\u4e3aConvNeXt V2\u5757\uff1b\u7528\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u3001PDE\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u4f5c\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u9006\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6e4d\u6d41\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u573a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u51c6\u786e\u6b63\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6355\u6349\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u51c6\u786e\u63a8\u65adPDE\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "FI - Conv\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, the orchestration policies governing expert interaction and sequencing remain largely opaque. We introduce INFORM, an interpretability analysis that treats orchestration as an explicit, analyzable computation, enabling the decoupling of expert interaction structure, execution order, and causal attribution. We use INFORM to evaluate an orchestrator on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MMLU using a homogeneous consortium of ten instruction-tuned experts drawn from LLaMA-3.1 8B, Qwen-3 8B, and DeepSeek-R1 8B, with controlled decoding-temperature variation, and a secondary heterogeneous consortium spanning 1B-7B parameter models. Across tasks, routing dominance is a poor proxy for functional necessity. We reveal a divergence between relational importance, captured by routing mass and interaction topology, and intrinsic importance, measured via gradient-based causal attribution: frequently selected experts often act as interaction hubs with limited causal influence, while sparsely routed experts can be structurally critical. Orchestration behaviors emerge asynchronously, with expert centralization preceding stable routing confidence and expert ordering remaining non-deterministic. Targeted ablations show that masking intrinsically important experts induces disproportionate collapse in interaction structure compared to masking frequent peers, confirming that INFORM exposes causal and structural dependencies beyond accuracy metrics alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165INFORM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f16\u6392\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8def\u7531\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u529f\u80fd\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5173\u7cfb\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u5185\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7f16\u6392\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6b65\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14INFORM\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7f16\u6392\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165INFORM\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u540c\u8d28\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u4e13\u5bb6\u8054\u76df\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f16\u6392\u5668\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u7801\u6e29\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8def\u7531\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u4e0d\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u4ee3\u8868\u529f\u80fd\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u5173\u7cfb\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u5185\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u7f16\u6392\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6b65\u51fa\u73b0\uff1b\u5c4f\u853d\u5185\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u4e13\u5bb6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "INFORM\u80fd\u66b4\u9732\u8d85\u8d8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

This paper identifies limitations in this methodology that, depending on the exact setup, can lead to both underestimating and overestimating the similarity of value orientation. Using the World Value Survey in three languages across five countries, we demonstrate that prompting methods (direct vs. chain-of-thought) and decoding strategies (greedy vs. sampling) significantly affect results. To assess the interaction between answers, we introduce a novel metric, self-correlation distance. This metric measures whether LLMs maintain consistent relationships between answers across different questions, as humans do. This indicates that even a high average agreement with human data, when considering LLM responses independently, does not guarantee structural alignment in responses. Additionally, we reveal a weak correlation between two common evaluation metrics, mean-squared distance and KL divergence, which assume that survey answers are independent of each other.

A lightweight three-dimensional (3D) U-Net learns residual components beyond the low-rank structure, bridging algebraic models and realistic propagation effects. Empirical recovery threshold analysis shows that sample complexity scales approximately with intrinsic model dimensionality $L(N_r + N_t + N_f)$ rather than ambient tensor size $N_r N_t N_f$, where $L$ denotes the number of dominant propagation paths.

On the contrary, numerous functional studies have revealed that dream sleep does play an important role in our learning and other intellectual functions. Specifically, recent studies have suggested the importance of dream sleep in memory consolidation, following the findings of neural replaying of recent waking patterns in the hippocampus. The randomness has been the hurdle that divides dream theories into either functional or functionless. This study presents a cognitive and computational model of dream process. This model is simulated to perform the functions of learning and memory consolidation, which are two most popular dream functions that have been proposed. The simulations demonstrate that random signals may result in learning and memory consolidation. Thus, dreaming is proposed as a continuation of brain's waking activities that processes signals activated spontaneously and randomly from the hippocampus.

We theoretically show that Mosaic Learning (i) shows state-of-the-art worst-case convergence rate, and (ii) leverages parameter correlation in an ML model, improving contraction by reducing the highest eigenvalue of a simplified system. We empirically evaluate Mosaic Learning on four learning tasks and observe up to 12 percentage points higher node-level test accuracy compared to epidemic learning (EL), a state-of-the-art baseline.

Reviewing the ChartU dataset synthesis and data selection domains, we find that subsets can potentially probe the MLLMs' capability gains from full-set fine-tuning. Given that data diversity is vital for boosting MLLMs' performance and entropy reflects this feature, we propose EXaMCaP, which uses entropy gain maximization to select a subset. To obtain a high-diversity subset, EXaMCaP chooses the maximum-entropy subset from the large ChartU dataset. As enumerating all possible subsets is impractical, EXaMCaP iteratively selects samples to maximize the gain in set entropy relative to the current set, approximating the maximum-entropy subset of the full dataset.

This paper asks what signals drive LVC classification by systematically restricting model inputs. Using UD-derived supervision, we compare lemma-driven baselines (lemma TF--IDF + Logistic Regression; BERTurk trained on lemma sequences), a grammar-only Logistic Regression over UD morphosyntax (UPOS/DEPREL/MORPH), and a full-input BERTurk baseline. We evaluate on a controlled diagnostic set with Random negatives, lexical controls (NLVC), and LVC positives, reporting split-wise performance to expose decision-boundary behavior. Results show that coarse morphosyntax alone is insufficient for robust LVC detection under controlled contrasts, while lexical identity supports LVC judgments but is sensitive to calibration and normalization choices.

However, collecting new labelled data at each time step remains expensive and logistically difficult, especially in dynamic or remote ecological systems. As a response to this challenge, we demonstrate that a model with access to reference data solely from time step t0 can perform competitively on both t0 and a future time step t1, outperforming models trained separately on time-specific reference data (the gold standard). This finding suggests that effective temporal generalization can be achieved without requiring manual updates to reference labels beyond the initial time step t0. Drawing on concepts from change detection and semi-supervised learning (SSL), the most performant approach, \"Common Ground\", uses a semi-supervised framework that leverages temporally stable regions-areas with little to no change in spectral or semantic characteristics between time steps-as a source of implicit supervision for dynamic regions. We evaluate this strategy across multiple classifiers, sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral and airborne imaging spectroscopy), and ecological use cases. For invasive tree species mapping, we observed a 21-40% improvement in classification accuracy using Common Ground compared to naive temporal transfer, where models trained at a single time step are directly applied to a future time step. We also observe a 10 -16% higher accuracy for the introduced approach compared to a gold-standard approach. In contrast, when broad land cover categories were mapped across Europe, we observed a more modest 2% increase in accuracy compared to both the naive and gold-standard approaches.

The ability to recognise and interpret these flowcharts is in high demand, as they provide valuable insights unavailable in text-only explanations. However, developing VLMs with precise flowchart understanding requires large-scale datasets of flowchart images and corresponding text, the creation of which is highly time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce JSynFlow, a synthesised visual QA dataset for Japanese flowcharts, generated using large language models (LLMs).

Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method.

However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively.

Second, we introduce Top-k KL estimator, which allows for flexible interpolation between exact KL and sampled KL. We derive the stability conditions for using EMA anchor; moreover, we show that our Top-k KL estimator yields both unbiased KL values and unbiased gradients at any k, while bringing the benefits of exact KL.

However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%. We use this analysis to discuss what makes a \"good\" instruction for the OpenEMMA framework.

Attributing to helpful-harmless trade-off from LLM alignment, agents typically also inherit the flaw of \"over-refusal\", which is a passive failure mode. However, the proactive planning and action capabilities of agents introduce another crucial danger on the other side of the trade-off. This phenomenon we term \"Toxic Proactivity'': an active failure mode in which an agent, driven by the optimization for Machiavellian helpfulness, disregards ethical constraints to maximize utility. Unlike over-refusal, Toxic Proactivity manifests as the agent taking excessive or manipulative measures to ensure its \"usefulness'' is maintained. Existing research pays little attention to identifying this behavior, as it often lacks the subtle context required for such strategies to unfold. To reveal this risk, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on dilemma-driven interactions between dual models, enabling the simulation and analysis of agent behavior over multi-step behavioral trajectories. Through extensive experiments with mainstream LLMs, we demonstrate that Toxic Proactivity is a widespread behavioral phenomenon and reveal two major tendencies.

To address this issue, we propose an Echo State Network (ESN) approach for radar-based HGR, using frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) radar signals. Raw radar data is first converted into feature maps, such as range-time and Doppler-time maps, which are then fed into one or more recurrent neural network-based reservoirs. The obtained reservoir states are processed by readout classifiers, including ridge regression, support vector machines, and random forests. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on an 11-class HGR task using the Soli dataset and surpasses existing deep learning models on a 4-class HGR task using the Dop-NET dataset. The results indicate that parallel processing using multi-reservoir ESNs are effective for recognizing temporal patterns from the multiple different feature maps in the time-space and time-frequency domains.

However, existing TTS methods for VLAs require additional training, verifiers, and multiple forward passes, making them impractical for deployment. Moreover, they intervene only at action decoding while keeping visual representations fixed-insufficient under perceptual ambiguity, where reconsidering how to perceive is as important as deciding what to do. To address these limitations, we propose SCALE, a simple inference strategy that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on 'self-uncertainty', inspired by uncertainty-driven exploration in Active Inference theory-requiring no additional training, no verifier, and only a single forward pass. SCALE broadens exploration in both perception and action under high uncertainty, while focusing on exploitation when confident-enabling adaptive execution across varying conditions.

In our preliminary experiments, we observe that naively applying full-parameter safety fine-tuning to MoE models can reduce attack success rates through routing or expert dominance effects, rather than by directly repairing Safety-Critical Experts. To address this challenge, we propose RASA, a routing-aware expert-level alignment framework that explicitly repairs Safety-Critical Experts while preventing routing-based bypasses. RASA identifies experts disproportionately activated by successful jailbreaks, selectively fine-tunes only these experts under fixed routing, and subsequently enforces routing consistency with safety-aligned contexts. Across two representative MoE architectures and a diverse set of jailbreak attacks, RASA achieves near-perfect robustness, strong cross-attack generalization, and substantially reduced over-refusal, while preserving general capabilities on benchmarks such as MMLU, GSM8K, and TruthfulQA.

One important step towards this goal is to create systems that can induce rich representations of data that are seen in-context, and then flexibly deploy these representations to accomplish goals. Recently, Park et al. (2024) demonstrated that current LLMs are indeed capable of inducing such representation from context (i.e., in-context representation learning). The present study investigates whether LLMs can use these representations to complete simple downstream tasks.\n  We first assess whether open-weights LLMs can use in-context representations for next-token prediction, and then probe models using a novel task, adaptive world modeling. In both tasks, we find evidence that open-weights LLMs struggle to deploy representations of novel semantics that are defined in-context, even if they encode these semantics in their latent representations. Furthermore, we assess closed-source, state-of-the-art reasoning models on the adaptive world modeling task, demonstrating that even the most performant LLMs cannot reliably leverage novel patterns presented in-context.

However, applying autoregressive modeling to continuous robot actions requires an effective action tokenization scheme. Existing approaches either rely on analytical discretization methods that produce prohibitively long token sequences, or learned latent tokenizers that lack structure, limiting their compatibility with next-token prediction. In this work, we identify three desiderata for action tokenization - high compression, total decodability, and a left-to-right causally ordered token space - and introduce Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer that satisfies all three. OAT discretizes action chunks into an ordered sequence of tokens using transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms. The resulting token space aligns naturally with autoregressive generation and enables prefix-based detokenization, yielding an anytime trade-off between inference cost and action fidelity. Across more than 20 tasks spanning four simulation benchmarks and real-world settings, autoregressive policies equipped with OAT consistently outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines, while offering significantly greater flexibility at inference time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOrdered Action Tokenization (OAT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c06\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u957f\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOAT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e26\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u7684\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u3001\u6709\u9650\u6807\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u5757\u79bb\u6563\u4e3a\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u768420\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u914d\u5907OAT\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "OAT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5de6\u5230\u53f3\u56e0\u679c\u6709\u5e8f\u4e09\u4e2a\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Federated Learning (FL) is an important paradigm for the Web because it enables privacy-preserving, collaborative machine learning across diverse user devices, web services and clients without needing to centralize sensitive data. However, its performance degrades severely under non-IID client distributions that is prevalent in real-world web systems. In this work, we propose a new training paradigm - Iterative Federated Adaptation (IFA) - that enhances generalization in heterogeneous federated settings through generation-wise forget and evolve strategy. Specifically, we divide training into multiple generations and, at the end of each, select a fraction of model parameters (a) randomly or (b) from the later layers of the model and reinitialize them. This iterative forget and evolve schedule allows the model to escape local minima and preserve globally relevant representations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MIT-Indoors, and Stanford Dogs datasets show that the proposed approach improves global accuracy, especially when the data cross clients are Non-IID. This method can be implemented on top any federated algorithm to improve its generalization performance. We observe an average of 21.5%improvement across datasets.

Bhattacharya and Debanjan Goswami contributed equally to this work", "summary": "Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6ACIL\uff0c\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u90fd\u6709\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5de8\u5927\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7cbe\u529b\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u9700\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7cbe\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faACIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u8bc6\u522b\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u9700\u8981\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u4e0b\u4e00\u8f6e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ACIL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enhance the robustness and generalization of end-to-end driving models in diverse and unseen scenarios. However, existing VLM-based approaches still face challenges, including suboptimal lane perception, language understanding biases, and difficulties in handling corner cases. To address these issues, we propose AppleVLM, an advanced perception and planning-enhanced VLM model for robust end-to-end driving. AppleVLM introduces a novel vision encoder and a planning strategy encoder to improve perception and decision-making. Firstly, the vision encoder fuses spatial-temporal information from multi-view images across multiple timesteps using a deformable transformer mechanism, enhancing robustness to camera variations and facilitating scalable deployment across different vehicle platforms. Secondly, unlike traditional VLM-based approaches, AppleVLM introduces a dedicated planning modality that encodes explicit Bird's-Eye-View spatial information, mitigating language biases in navigation instructions. Finally, a VLM decoder fine-tuned by a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought integrates vision, language, and planning features to output robust driving waypoints.

However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

This problem is inherently difficult because extreme events can trigger abrupt regime shifts in load patterns, while relevant extreme samples are rare and irregular, making reliable learning and calibration challenging. We propose AdaCNP, a probabilistic forecasting model for data-scarce condition. AdaCNP learns similarity in a shared embedding space. For each target data, it evaluates how relevant each historical context segment is to the current condition and reweights the context information accordingly. This design highlights the most informative historical evidence even when extreme samples are rare. It enables few-shot adaptation to previously unseen extreme patterns. AdaCNP also produces predictive distributions for risk-aware decision-making without expensive fine-tuning on the target domain. We evaluate AdaCNP on real-world power-system load data and compare it against a range of representative baselines. The results show that AdaCNP is more robust during extreme periods, reducing the mean squared error by 22\\% relative to the strongest baseline while achieving the lowest negative log-likelihood, indicating more reliable probabilistic outputs. These findings suggest that AdaCNP can effectively mitigate the combined impact of abrupt distribution shifts and scarce extreme samples, providing a more trustworthy forecasting for resilient power system operation under extreme events.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAdaCNP\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u8377\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u671f\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8017\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaCNP\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u8377\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c1122%\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaCNP\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u5206\u5e03\u7a81\u53d8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Structural analysis using tree edit distance reveals that subsequent reasoning trajectories inherit structurally similar error patterns from the context.

However, existing GNN-based methods typically suffer from restricted receptive fields that miss long-range dependencies and a \"single-pass\" inference paradigm that leads to error accumulation. To address these bottlenecks, we propose RIGA-Fold, a framework that synergizes Recurrent Interaction with Geometric Awareness. At the micro-level, we introduce a Geometric Attention Update (GAU) module where edge features explicitly serve as attention keys, ensuring strictly SE(3)-invariant local encoding. At the macro-level, we design an attention-based Global Context Bridge that acts as a soft gating mechanism to dynamically inject global topological information. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between structural and sequence modalities, we introduce an enhanced variant, RIGA-Fold*, which integrates trainable geometric features with frozen evolutionary priors from ESM-2 and ESM-IF via a dual-stream architecture. Finally, a biologically inspired ``predict-recycle-refine'' strategy is implemented to iteratively denoise sequence distributions.

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions.

PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner and suffers form reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we develop a new pure on policy actor-critic RL method for the LM-RLHF setting. We present SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control),a novel RLHF algorithm that combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with a new multi-layer stabilization framework combining entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds. Unlike standard PPO's symmetric KL penalties, SAFE distinguishes high-entropy exploration from low-entropy mode collapse and adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward velocity. Experiments on a 3B parameter model show SAFE achieves +5.15\\% training-average reward than PPO (0.725 vs 0.689), negligible reward crashes, and superior KL control than ppo . Our method adds minimal computational overhead and provides an interpretable, crash-resistant RLHF framework that maintains aggressive learning speed while ensuring stable long-horizon optimization suitable for production deployment.

A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers.

Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static \"magic layer\" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering.

In this work, we aim to address these questions through a unified spectral perspective. Specifically, we view Muon as the p = 0 endpoint of a family of spectral transformations of the form U \\boldsymbol\u03a3^{p} V' , and consider additional variants with p = 1/2 , p = 1/4 , and p = 1 . These transformations are applied to both first-moment updates, as in momentum SGD, and to root-mean-square (RMS) normalized gradient updates as in Adam. To enable efficient computation, we develop a coupled Newton iteration that avoids explicit singular value decomposition. Across controlled experiments, we find that RMS-normalized updates yield more stable optimization than first-moment updates. Moreover, while spectral compression provides strong stabilization benefits under first-moment updates, the Muon update (p = 0) does not consistently outperform Adam. These results suggest that Muon is best understood as an effective form of spectral normalization, but not a universally superior optimization method.

Despite many efforts, an ongoing challenge is hidden bias: LLMs appear fair under standard evaluations, but can produce biased responses outside those evaluation settings. In this paper, we identify framing -- differences in how semantically equivalent prompts are expressed (e.g., \"A is better than B\" vs. \"B is worse than A\") -- as an underexplored contributor to this gap. We first introduce the concept of \"framing disparity\" to quantify the impact of framing on fairness evaluation. By augmenting fairness evaluation benchmarks with alternative framings, we find that (1) fairness scores vary significantly with framing and (2) existing debiasing methods improve overall (i.e., frame-averaged) fairness, but often fail to reduce framing-induced disparities. To address this, we propose a framing-aware debiasing method that encourages LLMs to be more consistent across framings. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces overall bias and improves robustness against framing disparities, enabling LLMs to produce fairer and more consistent responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6574\u4f53\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8de8\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5145\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u968f\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6846\u67b6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u6574\u4f53\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6846\u67b6\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002"}}

However, conventional KD formulations - typically based on Kullback-Leibler divergence - assume that the teacher provides reliable soft targets.

We introduce REDistill (Robust Estimator Distillation), a simple yet principled framework grounded in robust statistics. REDistill replaces the standard KD objective with a power divergence loss, a generalization of KL divergence that adaptively downweights unreliable teacher output while preserving informative logit relationships. This formulation provides a unified and interpretable treatment of teacher noise, requires only logits, integrates seamlessly into existing KD pipelines, and incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that REDistill consistently improves student accuracy in diverse teacher-student architectures.

While current editing approaches predominantly focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, the direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored. Prior attempts, such as VoxHammer, rely on voxel-based representations that suffer from limited resolution and necessitate labor-intensive 3D mask. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating strategies to precisely localize target regions using only 2D image conditions. Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information.

However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\\mathbf{> 5\\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\\mathbf{1.57\\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\\mathbf{2.28\\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality.

A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme.

We define an action in deployment to be perfectly rational if it maximises the hidden true value function in the steepest direction. The expected value discrepancy of a policy's actions against their rational counterparts, culminating over the trajectory in deployment, is defined to be expected rational risk; an empirical average version in training is also defined. Their difference, termed as rational risk gap, is decomposed into (1) an extrinsic component caused by environment shifts between training and deployment, and (2) an intrinsic one due to the algorithm's generalisability in a dynamic environment. They are upper bounded by, respectively, (1) the $1$-Wasserstein distance between transition kernels and initial state distributions in training and deployment, and (2) the empirical Rademacher complexity of the value function class.

However, their outputs often exhibit social biases, raising fairness concerns. Existing debiasing methods, such as fine-tuning on additional datasets or prompt engineering, face scalability issues or compromise user experience in multi-turn interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients. Finally, we mitigate bias by directly intervening on their activations at the projection layer.

Here we develop a dual-stage TransUNet-based multi-source precipitation merging framework (DDL-MSPMF) that integrates six MSPs with four ERA5 near-surface physical predictors. A first-stage classifier estimates daily precipitation occurrence probability, and a second-stage regressor fuses the classifier outputs together with all predictors to estimate daily precipitation amount at 0.25 degree resolution over China for 2001-2020. Benchmarking against multiple deep learning and hybrid baselines shows that the TransUNet - TransUNet configuration yields the best seasonal performance (R = 0.75; RMSE = 2.70 mm/day) and improves robustness relative to a single-regressor setting. For heavy precipitation (>25 mm/day), DDL-MSPMF increases equitable threat scores across most regions of eastern China and better reproduces the spatial pattern of the July 2021 Zhengzhou rainstorm, indicating enhanced extreme-event detection beyond seasonal-mean corrections. Independent evaluation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using TPHiPr further supports its applicability in data-scarce regions.

By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks. However, most existing self-consistency methods are limited to a fixed ``repeated sampling and voting'' paradigm and do not reuse historical reasoning information. As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and three models. The results show that the H-GIVR framework can significantly improve cross-modal reasoning accuracy while maintaining low computational cost.

Engelhard"], "title": "Interval-Based AUC (iAUC): Extending ROC Analysis to Uncertainty-Aware Classification", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "In high-stakes risk prediction, quantifying uncertainty through interval-valued predictions is essential for reliable decision-making. However, standard evaluation tools like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) are designed for point scores and fail to capture the impact of predictive uncertainty on ranking performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware ROC framework specifically for interval-valued predictions, introducing two new measures: $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$. This framework enables an informative three-region decomposition of the ROC plane, partitioning pairwise rankings into correct, incorrect, and uncertain orderings. This approach naturally supports selective prediction by allowing models to abstain from ranking cases with overlapping intervals, thereby optimizing the trade-off between abstention rate and discriminative reliability.

Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking. We show that the coupling strength acts as a spectral filter that enforces a tunable temporal hierarchy on generation. We support these predictions through controlled experiments with diffusion models trained on MNIST datasets and exact score samplers. These results motivate time dependent coupling schedules that target mode specific timescales, offering a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8026\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8026\u5408Ornstein - Uhlenbeck\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u53d8\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7531\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8c31\u5c42\u6b21\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u540c\u6b65\u95f4\u9699\u201d\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7269\u79cd\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5d29\u6e83\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5149\u8c31\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e34\u65f6\u6307\u5bfc\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper focuses on achieving accurate, fast, and robust wind speed prediction by full use of cluster data with spatial-temporal correlation. First, weighted mean filtering (WMF) is applied to denoise wind speed data at the single-farm level. The Legendre memory unit (LMU) is then innovatively applied for the wind speed prediction, in combination with the Compensating Parameter based on Kendall rank correlation coefficient (CPK) of wind farm cluster data, to construct the multi-slice LMU (MSLMU). Finally, an innovative ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU is proposed herein, with three key blocks: data pre-processing, forecasting, and multi-slice compensation. Advantages include: 1) LMU jointly models linear and nonlinear dependencies among farms to capture spatial-temporal correlations through backpropagation; 2) MSLMU enhances forecasting by using CPK-derived weights instead of random initialization, allowing spatial correlations to fully activate hidden nodes across clustered wind farms.; 3) CPK adaptively weights the compensation model in MSLMU and complements missing data spatially, to facilitate the whole model highly accurate and robust.

Such advice rarely involves identifying a single correct answer; instead, it typically requires navigating trade-offs among competing values. We aim to characterize how LLMs navigate value trade-offs across different advice-seeking contexts. First, we examine the value trade-off structure underlying advice seeking using a curated dataset from four advice-oriented subreddits. Using a bottom-up approach, we inductively construct a hierarchical value framework by aggregating fine-grained values extracted from individual advice options into higher-level value categories. We construct value co-occurrence networks to characterize how values co-occur within dilemmas and find substantial heterogeneity in value trade-off structures across advice-seeking contexts: a women-focused subreddit exhibits the highest network density, indicating more complex value conflicts; women's, men's, and friendship-related subreddits exhibit highly correlated value-conflict patterns centered on security-related tensions (security vs. respect/connection/commitment); by contrast, career advice forms a distinct structure where security frequently clashes with self-actualization and growth. We then evaluate LLM value preferences against these dilemmas and find that, across models and contexts, LLMs consistently prioritize values related to Exploration & Growth over Benevolence & Connection.

A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks.

The system strategically coordinates storage across local platoon vehicles, dynamic VFC clusters, and cloud server (CS) to minimize content retrieval latency. To efficiently manage distributed storage, we integrate large language models (LLMs) for real-time and intelligent caching decisions. The proposed approach leverages LLMs' ability to process heterogeneous information, including user profiles, historical data, content characteristics, and dynamic system states. Through a designed prompting framework encoding task objectives and caching constraints, the LLMs formulate caching as a decision-making task, and our hierarchical deterministic caching mapping strategy enables adaptive requests prediction and precise content placement across three tiers without frequent retraining.

Inspired by biological systems, the framework uses a two-level architecture: evolutionary optimization (outer loop) discovers afferent sensing architectures that enable effective policy learning, while reinforcement learning (inner loop) trains damage-avoidance policies using these signals. This formalizes afferent sensing as providing an inductive bias for efficient learning: architectures are selected based on their ability to enable effective learning (rather than directly minimizing damage). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded-noise assumptions. We illustrate the general approach in the challenging context of biomechanical digital twins operating over long time horizons (multiple decades of the life-course).

BrainVista incorporates Network-wise Tokenizers to disentangle system-specific dynamics and a Spatial Mixer Head that captures inter-network information flow without compromising functional boundaries. Furthermore, we propose a novel Stimulus-to-Brain (S2B) masking mechanism to synchronize high-frequency sensory stimuli with hemodynamically filtered signals, enabling strict, history-only causal conditioning.

These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u80fd\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e38\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u4e24\u4e2a\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u82e5\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6570\u503c\u60e9\u7f5a\u5c31\u80fd\u8ba9\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u5951\u5408\u9632\u5fa1\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

With the advance of AI systems in recent years, it has become apparent that such agreements, in order to be acceptable to the involved parties, must remain aligned with ethical principles and moral values. However, this is notoriously difficult to ensure, especially as different human users (and their software agents) may hold different value systems, i.e. they may differently weigh the importance of individual moral values. Furthermore, it is often hard to specify the precise meaning of a value in a particular context in a computational manner. Methods to estimate value systems based on human-engineered specifications, e.g. based on value surveys, are limited in scale due to the need for intense human moderation. In this article, we propose a novel method to automatically \\emph{learn} value systems from observations and human demonstrations. In particular, we propose a formal model of the \\emph{value system learning} problem, its instantiation to sequential decision-making domains based on multi-objective Markov decision processes, as well as tailored preference-based and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms to infer value grounding functions and value systems.

However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations.

While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u81a8\u80c0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLycheeDecode\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u81a8\u80c0\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5171\u4eab\u4ee4\u724c\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684LycheeDecode\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684top - k\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528HardKuma\u673a\u5236\u5212\u5206\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLycheeDecode\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5728128K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe2.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, recent empirical results indicate that the state of trained linear attention models often exhibits a low-rank structure, suggesting that these models underexploit their capacity in practice. To illuminate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis of the role of rank in linear attention, revealing that low effective rank can affect retrieval error by amplifying query noise. In addition to these theoretical insights, we conjecture that the low-rank states can be substantially reduced post-training with only minimal performance degradation, yielding faster and more memory-efficient models. To this end, we propose a novel hardware-aware approach that structurally prunes key and query matrices, reducing the state size while retaining compatibility with existing CUDA kernels. We adapt several existing pruning strategies to fit our framework and, building on our theoretical analysis, propose a novel structured pruning method based on a rank-revealing QR decomposition. Our empirical results, evaluated across models of varying sizes and on various downstream tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of our state reduction framework. We highlight that our framework enables the removal of 50% of the query and key channels at only a marginal increase in perplexity.

We evaluate the pretrained encoder under multiple downstream adaptation regimes, including lightweight task-specific adapters with a frozen backbone as well as full end-to-end fine-tuning for classification, allowing us to assess both representation quality and task-specific performance. OmniRad is evaluated on a broad suite of public benchmarks spanning classification and segmentation across multiple modalities.

Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions.

We implement the framework in a configurable simulation testbed and benchmark its performance against traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning baselines under varied traffic conditions.

Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods.

Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) addresses this through conditional computation, with Expert Parallel (EP) as the standard distributed training method. However, EP has three limitations: communication cost grows linearly with the number of activated experts $k$, load imbalance affects latency and memory usage, and data-dependent communication requires metadata exchange. We propose Multi-Head LatentMoE and Head Parallel (HP), a new architecture and parallelism achieving $O(1)$ communication cost regardless of $k$, completely balanced traffic, and deterministic communication, all while remaining compatible with EP. To accelerate Multi-Head LatentMoE, we propose IO-aware routing and expert computation.

Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks.

Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead.

Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation.

However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks.

Neuromorphic networks, with structures inspired by the brain's architecture, offer a compelling solution with the potential to approach the extreme energy efficiency of neurobiological systems.

We propose a local feedback mechanism operating entirely in the optical domain that implements a Hebbian learning rule using non-volatile phase-change material synapses. We experimentally demonstrate this approach on a non-trivial letter recognition task using a commercially available fiber-optic platform and achieve a 100 percent recognition rate, showcasing an all-optical solution for efficient, real-time information processing.

We test whether LLM-simulated survey respondents, prompted with participant profiles drawn from social survey data measuring network, demographic, attitudinal and behavioral features, can reproduce human patterns of misinformation belief and sharing. Using three online surveys as baselines, we evaluate whether LLM outputs match observed response distributions and recover feature-outcome associations present in the original survey data. LLM-generated responses capture broad distributional tendencies and show modest correlation with human responses, but consistently overstate the association between belief and sharing. Linear models fit to simulated responses exhibit substantially higher explained variance and place disproportionate weight on attitudinal and behavioral features, while largely ignoring personal network characteristics, relative to models fit to human responses.

Traditional point prediction methods often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in time series data, while existing probabilistic approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with interpretability. We propose a novel Multi-Expert Learning Distributional Labels (LDL) framework that addresses these challenges through mixture-of-experts architectures with distributional learning capabilities. Our approach introduces two complementary methods: (1) Multi-Expert LDL, which employs multiple experts with different learned parameters to capture diverse temporal patterns, and (2) Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE, which explicitly decomposes time series into interpretable components (trend, seasonality, changepoints, volatility) through specialized sub-experts. Both frameworks extend traditional point prediction to distributional learning, enabling rich uncertainty quantification through Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).

However, PPG signals are susceptible to motion artifacts and noise, making accurate estimation of vital signs such as arterial blood pressure (ABP) challenging. Existing estimation methods are often restricted to a single-task or environment, limiting their generalizability across diverse PPG decoding scenarios. Moreover, recent general-purpose approaches typically rely on predictions over multi-second intervals, discarding the morphological characteristics of vital signs. To address these challenges, we propose PENGUIN, a generative flow-matching framework that extends deep state space models, enabling fine-grained conditioning on PPG for reconstructing multiple vital signs as continuous waveforms. We evaluate PENGUIN using six real-world PPG datasets across three distinct vital sign reconstruction tasks (electrocardiogram reconstruction, respiratory monitoring, and ABP monitoring).

In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues.

SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions.

APE represents latent intent as interpretable feature requirements using language model priors, adaptively generates visual queries, and compiles elicited requirements into effective prompts. Evaluation on IDEA-Bench and DesignBench shows that APE achieves stronger alignment with improved efficiency.

While numerous bias mitigation methods have been proposed, comparing the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods remains difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision versus multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons. We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy. (3) an analysis showing that while LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy, they still exhibit subgroup disparities, and gains from scaling are typically smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices.

Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings.

This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\\%$ and $5.80\\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention.

While foundation models have transformed language and vision via large-scale pretraining and lightweight adaptation, extending this paradigm to general, real-world graphs is challenging. In this work, we present Graph Billion- Foundation-Fusion (GraphBFF): the first end-to-end recipe for building billion-parameter Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for arbitrary heterogeneous, billion-scale graphs. Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck. The GraphBFF framework provides concrete methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for building GFMs at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an evaluation of a 1.4 billion-parameter GraphBFF Transformer pretrained on one billion samples. Across ten diverse, real-world downstream tasks on graphs unseen during training, spanning node- and link-level classification and regression, GraphBFF achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance, including in few-shot settings, with large margins of up to 31 PRAUC points.

Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%.

However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring \"Closed-Book Training\" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization.

Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions.

Although instantiated in ORCA, these design principles are applicable to research agents more generally and easily expandable to additional quantum chemistry packages and beyond. Quntur supports the full range of calculations available in ORCA 6.0 and reasons over software documentation and scientific literature to plan, execute, adapt, and analyze in silico chemistry experiments following best practices.

These models aim to circumvent direct first-principles modeling of solid-state phase transformations, instead learning from large databases of successfully synthesized materials. Here, we assess the alignment of several recently introduced synthesis prediction models with material and reaction thermodynamics, quantified by the energy with respect to the convex hull and a metric accounting for thermodynamic selectivity of enumerated synthesis reactions. A dataset of successful synthesis recipes was used to determine the likely bounds on both quantities beyond which materials can be deemed unlikely to be synthesized. With these bounds as context, thermodynamic quantities were computed using the CHGNet foundation potential for thousands of new hypothetical materials generated using the Chemeleon generative model. Four recently published machine learning models for synthesizability prediction were applied to this same dataset, and the resultant predictions were considered against computed thermodynamics. We find these models generally overpredict the likelihood of synthesis, but some model scores do trend with thermodynamic heuristics, assigning lower scores to materials that are less stable or do not have an available synthesis recipe that is calculated to be thermodynamically selective. In total, this work identifies existing gaps in machine learning models for materials synthesis and introduces a new approach to assess their quality in the absence of extensive negative examples (failed syntheses).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u9ad8\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd1\u671f\u5408\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u6210\u529f\u5408\u6210\u914d\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u786e\u5b9a\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u7528CHGNet\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b0\u5047\u8bbe\u6750\u6599\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u56db\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u9ad8\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6709\u8d8b\u52bf\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6750\u6599\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u91cf\u5931\u8d25\u5408\u6210\u6848\u4f8b\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm.

For example, during code-based reinforcement learning, a model may covertly manipulate logged accuracy for self-preservation. We present the first systematic study of this problem, introducing a taxonomy with five risk levels, ten fine-grained risk categories, and three incentive types.

While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.\n  To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm.

Under review", "summary": "Traditional diagnosis of aortic valve disease relies on echocardiography, but its cost and required expertise limit its use in large-scale early screening. Photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising screening modality due to its widespread availability in wearable devices and its ability to reflect underlying hemodynamic dynamics. However, the extreme scarcity of gold-standard labeled PPG data severely constrains the effectiveness of data-driven approaches. To address this challenge, we propose and validate a new paradigm, Physiology-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL), aimed at unlocking the value of large-scale unlabeled PPG data for efficient screening of Aortic Stenosis (AS) and Aortic Regurgitation (AR). Using over 170,000 unlabeled PPG samples from the UK Biobank, we formalize clinical knowledge into a set of PPG morphological phenotypes and construct a pulse pattern recognition proxy task for self-supervised pre-training. A dual-branch, gated-fusion architecture is then employed for efficient fine-tuning on a small labeled subset. The proposed PG-SSL framework achieves AUCs of 0.765 and 0.776 for AS and AR screening, respectively, significantly outperforming supervised baselines trained on limited labeled data. Multivariable analysis further validates the model output as an independent digital biomarker with sustained prognostic value after adjustment for standard clinical risk factors. This study demonstrates that PG-SSL provides an effective, domain knowledge-driven solution to label scarcity in medical artificial intelligence and shows strong potential for enabling low-cost, large-scale early screening of aortic valve disease.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faPG - SSL\u8303\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u8bb0PPG\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u75be\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66AI\u6807\u8bb0\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e14PPG\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u672a\u6807\u8bb0PPG\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7b5b\u67e5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PG - SSL\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aPPG\u5f62\u6001\u8868\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u6807\u8bb0\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "PG - SSL\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u72ed\u7a84\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u53cd\u6d41\u7b5b\u67e5\u7684AUC\u5206\u522b\u8fbe0.765\u548c0.776\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u72ec\u7acb\u6570\u5b57\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u540e\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "PG - SSL\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6807\u8bb0\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u3001\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u75be\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets. As model scale increases, these gains become more pronounced, and proxy-trained models eventually match or rival tokenizer approaches, all while operating solely on raw bytes and retaining the inherent robustness of byte-level modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee3\u7406\u538b\u7f29\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u539f\u59cb\u5b57\u8282\u63a5\u53e3\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u538b\u7f29\u8f93\u5165\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u5b57\u8282\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u90e8\u5bf9\u9f50\u538b\u7f29\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u5b57\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u538b\u7f29\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u538b\u7f29\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u5b57\u8282\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, these models often suffer from severe performance degradation when confronted with domain shifts, particularly in the presence of unseen noise and channel distortions. In view of this, we in this paper present URSA-GAN, a unified and domain-aware generative framework specifically designed to mitigate mismatches in both noise and channel conditions. URSA-GAN leverages a dual-embedding architecture that consists of a noise encoder and a channel encoder, each pre-trained with limited in-domain data to capture domain-relevant representations. These embeddings condition a GAN-based speech generator, facilitating the synthesis of speech that is acoustically aligned with the target domain while preserving phonetic content. To enhance generalization further, we propose dynamic stochastic perturbation, a novel regularization technique that introduces controlled variability into the embeddings during generation, promoting robustness to unseen domains. Empirical results demonstrate that URSA-GAN effectively reduces character error rates in ASR and improves perceptual metrics in SE across diverse noisy and mismatched channel scenarios.

We propose HoRD, a two-stage learning framework for robust humanoid control under domain shift. First, we train a high-performance teacher policy via history-conditioned reinforcement learning, where the policy infers latent dynamics context from recent state--action trajectories to adapt online to diverse randomized dynamics. Second, we perform online distillation to transfer the teacher's robust control capabilities into a transformer-based student policy that operates on sparse root-relative 3D joint keypoint trajectories. By combining history-conditioned adaptation with online distillation, HoRD enables a single policy to adapt zero-shot to unseen domains without per-domain retraining. Extensive experiments show HoRD outperforms strong baselines in robustness and transfer, especially under unseen domains and external perturbations.

In this study, we present a machine learning (ML)-driven framework that leverages advanced models, including Time Series Forest (TSF), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a simple feedforward neural network (NN), to classify crystal systems, point groups, and space groups from XRD data of perovskite materials. To address class imbalance and enhance model robustness, we integrated feature augmentation strategies such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), class weighting, jittering, and spectrum shifting, along with efficient data preprocessing pipelines. The TSF model with SMOTE augmentation achieved strong performance for crystal system prediction, with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9, an F1 score of 0.92, and an accuracy of 97.76%. For point and space group prediction, balanced accuracies above 95% were obtained. The model demonstrated high performance for symmetry-distinct classes, including cubic crystal systems, point groups 3m and m-3m, and space groups Pnma and Pnnn.

To address this, cluster-level randomization has become standard, enabling the use of network-aware estimators. These estimators typically trim the data to retain only a subset of informative units, achieving low bias under suitable conditions but often suffering from high variance. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the interior nodes - units whose neighbors all lie within the same cluster - constitute the vast majority of the post-trimming subpopulation. In light of this, we propose directly averaging over the interior nodes to construct the mean-in-interior (MII) estimator, which circumvents the delicate reweighting required by existing network-aware estimators and substantially reduces variance in classical settings. However, we show that interior nodes are often not representative of the full population, particularly in terms of network-dependent covariates, leading to notable bias. We then augment the MII estimator with a counterfactual predictor trained on the entire network, allowing us to adjust for covariate distribution shifts between the interior nodes and full population. By rearranging the expression, we reveal that our augmented MII estimator embodies an analytical form of the point estimator within prediction-powered inference framework. This insight motivates a semi-supervised lens, wherein interior nodes are treated as labeled data subject to selection bias. Extensive and challenging simulation studies demonstrate the outstanding performance of our augmented MII estimator across various settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9A/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5e72\u6270\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3aMII\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3A/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7f51\u7edc\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u611f\u77e5\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u8282\u70b9\u6c42\u5e73\u5747\u6784\u5efaMII\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u540e\u7528\u5728\u5168\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9MII\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u589e\u5f3a\u7684MII\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u5f3a\u7684MII\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3A/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7f51\u7edc\u5e72\u6270\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, weight sharing does not guarantee a stable token interface: during training, the correspondence between encoding tokens into hidden states and decoding hidden states into logits can drift, worsening optimization sensitivity and making post-training interventions such as editing, patching, and lightweight adaptation less predictable. We propose Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT), which synchronizes embedding and unembedding as coupled projections of a shared latent token memory, guaranteeing a pseudo-inverse-consistent interface throughout training. PIT maintains an orthonormal shared memory, obtained by thin polar decomposition for teacher initialization or random orthonormal initialization from scratch, and introduces a fully learned symmetric positive definite hidden-space transform parameterized via a Cholesky factor. The output head applies this transform to hidden states before the vocabulary projection, while the embedding applies the inverse transform to token vectors using stable triangular solves, avoiding explicit pseudo-inverse recomputation and any vocabulary-sized auxiliary parameters.

Recovering the interference-contaminated signal of interest in such settings is a central challenge, especially in single-channel RF processing. Existing data-driven methods often assume that the interference type is known, yielding ensembles of specialized models that scale poorly with the number of interferers. We show that detect-then-separate (DTS) strategies admit an analytical justification: within a Gaussian mixture framework, a plug-in maximum a posteriori detector followed by type-conditioned optimal estimation achieves asymptotic minimum mean-square error optimality under a mild temporal-diversity condition. This makes DTS a principled benchmark, but its reliance on multiple type-specific models limits scalability. Motivated by this, we propose a unified joint model (UJM), in which a single deep neural architecture learns to jointly detect and separate when applied directly to the received signal. Using tailored UNet architectures for baseband (complex-valued) RF signals, we compare DTS and UJM on synthetic and recorded interference types, showing that a capacity-matched UJM can match oracle-aided DTS performance across diverse signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios, interference types, and constellation orders, including mismatched training and testing type-uncertainty proportions. These findings highlight UJM as a scalable and practical alternative to DTS, while opening new directions for unified separation under broader regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5c04\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e72\u6270\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790DTS\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578bUJM\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u793aUJM\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aDTS\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5e72\u6270\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u4f18\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5206\u6790DTS\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u5f97\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u518d\u63d0\u51faUJM\uff0c\u7528\u5b9a\u5236UNet\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u6bd4DTS\u548cUJM\u3002", "result": "\u5bb9\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u7684UJM\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3cDTS\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "UJM\u662fDTS\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u79bb\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

One prominent threat in this context is backdoor attacks, in which adversaries embed hidden behaviors in language models that activate under specific conditions. Previous work has assumed that adversaries have access to training pipelines or deployment infrastructure. We propose a novel attack surface requiring neither, which utilizes the chat template. Chat templates are executable Jinja2 programs invoked at every inference call, occupying a privileged position between user input and model processing. We show that an adversary who distributes a model with a maliciously modified template can implant an inference-time backdoor without modifying model weights, poisoning training data, or controlling runtime infrastructure. We evaluated this attack vector by constructing template backdoors targeting two objectives: degrading factual accuracy and inducing emission of attacker-controlled URLs, and applied them across eighteen models spanning seven families and four inference engines. Under triggered conditions, factual accuracy drops from 90% to 15% on average while attacker-controlled URLs are emitted with success rates exceeding 80%; benign inputs show no measurable degradation. Backdoors generalize across inference runtimes and evade all automated security scans applied by the largest open-weight distribution platform. These results establish chat templates as a reliable and currently undefended attack surface in the LLM supply chain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u804a\u5929\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u90e8\u7f72\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u653b\u51fb\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u626b\u63cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u624b\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u90e8\u7f72\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u804a\u5929\u6a21\u677f\uff08Jinja2\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u53d1\u5e26\u6709\u6076\u610f\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u690d\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u540e\u95e8\uff0c\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u4e0d\u6c61\u67d3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u9488\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8f93\u51fa\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u63a7\u5236URL\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u540e\u95e8\uff0c\u572818\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u89e6\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece90%\u964d\u81f315%\uff0c\u8f93\u51faURL\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d8580%\uff0c\u826f\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u964d\u7ea7\uff1b\u540e\u95e8\u53ef\u8de8\u63a8\u7406\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u53d1\u5e73\u53f0\u5b89\u5168\u626b\u63cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u804a\u5929\u6a21\u677f\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u76ee\u524d\u65e0\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u3002"}}

Recently, LLM-based retriever models have shown state-of-the-art performance for RAG applications. However, several technical aspects remain underexplored on how to adapt general-purpose LLMs into effective domain-specific retrievers, especially in specialized domains such as biomedicine. We present Synthesize-Train-Merge (STM), a modular framework that enhances decoder-only LLMs with synthetic hard negatives, retrieval prompt optimization, and model merging. Experiments on a subset of 12 medical and general tasks from the MTEB benchmark show STM boosts task-specific experts by up to 23.5\\% (average 7.5\\%) and produces merged models that outperform both single experts and strong baselines without extensive pretraining. Our results demonstrate a scalable, efficient path for turning general LLMs into high-performing, domain-specialized retrievers, preserving general-domain capabilities while excelling on specialized tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSTM\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u5728MTEB\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSynthesize - Train - Merge (STM)\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728MTEB\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u768412\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSTM\u5c06\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8623.5%\uff08\u5e73\u57477.5%\uff09\uff0c\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "STM\u4e3a\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8d85\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6XtraLight - MedMamba\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5206\u7c7b\u80bf\u7624\u6027\u7ba1\u72b6\u817a\u7624\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c4\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\u5bf9\u764c\u524d\u606f\u8089\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u98ce\u9669\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u5f02\u578b\u589e\u751f\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faXtraLight - MedMamba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408ConvNext\u6d45\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u89c6\u89c9mamba\uff0c\u96c6\u6210SCAB\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528FNOClassifier\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "XtraLight - MedMamba\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea632000\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe97.18%\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a0.9767\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u548c\u4f20\u7edfMamba\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "XtraLight - MedMamba\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u80bf\u7624\u6027\u7ba1\u72b6\u817a\u7624\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.\n  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines.
