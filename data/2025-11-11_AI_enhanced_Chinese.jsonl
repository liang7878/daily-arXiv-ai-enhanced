It finds applications in diverse domains, including computer networks, transportation, and image segmentation. The core idea is to maximise the total flow across the network without violating capacity constraints on edges and ensuring flow conservation at intermediate nodes. The rapid growth of unstructured and semi-structured data has motivated the development of parallel solutions to compute MaxFlow. However, due to the higher computational complexity, computing Maxflow for real-world graphs is time-consuming in practice. In addition, these graphs are dynamic and constantly evolve over time. In this work, we propose two Push-Relabel based algorithms for processing dynamic graphs on GPUs. The key novelty of our algorithms is their ability to efficiently handle both increments and decrements in edge capacities together when they appear in a batch. We illustrate the efficacy of our algorithms with a suite of real-world graphs. Overall, we find that for small updates, dynamic recomputation is significantly faster than a static GPU-based Maxflow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ePush - Relabel\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5c0f\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bd4\u9759\u6001GPU\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u589e\u957f\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u884c\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u5b9e\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u4e45\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8ePush - Relabel\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6279\u91cf\u8fb9\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u51cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c0f\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bd4\u9759\u6001GPU\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c0f\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.\n  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.\n  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.\n  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol.

However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57fa\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAGRAG\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57fa\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u5dee\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u843d\u540e\u4e8eNaiveRAG\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u65f6\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3LLM\u5b9e\u4f53\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u5c06\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3aMCMI\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e3aNP - \u96be\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "MCMI\u5b50\u56fe\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u66f4\u597d\u805a\u7126\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5168\u9762\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AGRAG\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57fa\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This family of problems consists of games between two players: the leader and the follower. There is a market that is partitioned into two parts: the part of the leader and the part of the leader's competitors. The leader controls one part of the market and can freely set the prices for products. By contrast, the prices of the competitors' products are fixed and known in advance. The follower, then, needs to solve a combinatorial optimization problem in order to satisfy their own demands, while comparing the leader's offers to the offers of the competitors. Therefore, the leader has to hit the intricate balance of making an attractive offer to the follower, while at the same time ensuring that their own profit is maximized.\n  Pferschy, Nicosia, Pacifici, and Schauer considered the Stackelberg pricing game where the follower solves a knapsack problem. They raised the question whether this problem is complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e., $\u03a3^p_2$-complete. The same conjecture was also made by B\u00f6hnlein, Schaudt, and Schauer. In this paper, we positively settle this conjecture. Moreover, we show that this result holds actually in a much broader context: The Stackelberg pricing game is $\u03a3^p_2$-complete for over 50 NP-complete problems, including most classics such as TSP, vertex cover, clique, subset sum, etc. This result falls in line of recent meta-theorems about higher complexity in the polynomial hierarchy by Gr\u00fcne and Wulf.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76Stackelberg\u5b9a\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u80af\u5b9a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8be5\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\u89e3\u80cc\u5305\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u4e3a$\u03a3^p_2$-\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u4e14\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u60c5\u5883\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Pferschy\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Stackelberg\u5b9a\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\u662f\u5426\u4e3a$\u03a3^p_2$-\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u731c\u60f3\u3002", "method": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u80af\u5b9a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u4e14\u8868\u660eStackelberg\u5b9a\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d8550\u4e2aNP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u90fd\u662f$\u03a3^p_2$-\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "Stackelberg\u5b9a\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u662f$\u03a3^p_2$-\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u4e0e\u8fd1\u671f\u5173\u4e8e\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u66f4\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5143\u5b9a\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Existing approaches struggle in these scenarios because they rely on either non-interpretable clustering or model-dependent error heuristics, providing neither a differentiable notion of \"tailness\" nor a mechanism for rapid adaptation. We propose SAML, a Semantic-Aware Meta-Learning framework that introduces the first differentiable definition of tailness for motion forecasting. SAML quantifies motion rarity via semantically meaningful intrinsic (kinematic, geometric, temporal) and interactive (local and global risk) properties, which are fused by a Bayesian Tail Perceiver into a continuous, uncertainty-aware Tail Index.

This makes novel and transformative applications of machine learning to critical scientific use-cases more fragmented and less clear in pathways to impact. This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads.

The fourth and most recent halving happened in April 2024, cutting the block reward further to 3.125 BTC. If the demand did not decrease simultaneously after these halvings, then the neoclassical economic theory posits that the price of Bitcoin should have increased due to the halving. But did it, in fact, increase for that reason, or is this a post hoc fallacy? This paper uses synthetic control to construct a weighted Bitcoin that is different from its counterpart in one aspect - it did not undergo halving. Comparing the price trajectory of the actual and the simulated Bitcoins, I find evidence of a positive effect of the 2024 Bitcoin halving on its price three months later. The magnitude of this effect is one fifth of the total percentage change in the price of Bitcoin during the study period - from April 2, 2023, to July 21, 2024 (17 months).

This paper presents a review of probabilistic forecasting methods, tracing their evolution from Bayesian and distribution based approaches, through quantile regression techniques, to recent developments in conformal prediction. Particular emphasis is placed on advancements in probabilistic forecasting, including validity-focused methods which address key limitations in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, this review extends beyond the Day-Ahead Market to include the Intra-Day and Balancing Markets, where forecasting challenges are intensified by higher temporal granularity and real-time operational constraints.

Optimizing transmit beamforming and power splitting in such systems faces formidable challenges, e.g., time-varying channels and multi-tier interference, which create a complex decision landscape where conventional model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) suffers from sample inefficiency due to rarely-encountered state transitions and poor coordination as decentralized agents act independently. This paper proposes the Decentralized World Model with Reasoning Offloading (DWM-RO) framework to address these fundamental limitations. Specifically, each agent employs a world model to learn compact predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling imagination-based policy training that dramatically reduces required environment interactions. An uncertainty-aware offloading gate monitors local interference levels and model reconstruction errors to trigger selective edge coordination.

We introduce SMAGDi, a distillation framework that transfers the debate dynamics of a five-agent Llama-based MAS into a compact Socratic decomposer-solver student. SMAGDi represents debate traces as directed interaction graphs, where nodes encode intermediate reasoning steps with correctness labels and edges capture continuity and cross-agent influence. The student is trained with a composite objective combining language modeling, graph-based supervision, contrastive reasoning, and embedding alignment to preserve both fluency and structured reasoning. On StrategyQA and MMLU, SMAGDi compresses a 40B multi-agent system into a 6B student while retaining 88% of its accuracy, substantially outperforming prior distillation methods such as MAGDi, standard KD, and fine-tuned baselines.

Our result holds for arbitrary monotonic utilities and comes with an efficient algorithm. We also prove that an EF1 outcome is guaranteed to exist even when the goods lie on a path and each group must receive a connected bundle. In addition, we consider a probabilistic model where the utilities are additive and drawn randomly from a distribution. We show that if there are $n$ agents, the number of goods $m$ is divisible by the number of groups $k$, and all groups have the same size, then an envy-free outcome exists with high probability if $m = \u03c9(\\log n)$, and this bound is tight.

Enhancing LSM-based Key-Value Stores with More Compatible Lookups and Deletes", "categories": ["cs.DB"], "comment": null, "summary": "LSM-trees are featured by out-of-place updates, where key deletion is handled by inserting a tombstone to mark its staleness instead of removing it in place. This defers actual removal to compactions with greatly reduced overhead. However, this classic strategy struggles with another fundamental operator--range deletes--which removes all keys within a specified range, requiring the system to insert numerous tombstones and causing severe performance issues.\n  To address this, modern LSM-based systems introduce range tombstones that record the start and end keys to avoid per-key tombstones. Although this achieves impressive range delete efficiency, such a solution is incompatible with lookups. In particular, our experiments show that point lookup latency can increase by 30% even with just 1% range deletions in workloads. Further to our surprise, this issue has not been raised before, though the range tombstone solution has been employed for more than five years.\n  To address this critical performance issue, we propose GLORAN, an efficient range delete method that can be integrated into modern LSM-based systems and offers desirable range deletion performance without compromising point lookup efficiency. It introduces a global index that allows point lookups to quickly locate relevant ranges without retrieving many irrelevant elements, reducing the I/O complexity from O(N/\u03bb) to either O(\\log^2 N/(\u03bbF)) or O(\u03c6\\log N/F), where 1/\u03bbis the ratio of range deletes, and \u03c6is the FPR of Bloom filters in LSM-trees. Furthermore, we design an entry validity estimator to further enhance expected I/O cost to O(\u03b5\\log^2 N/(\u03bbF)) for looking up existing keys. Extensive evaluations indicate that GLORAN consistently outperforms baselines, while achieving up to 10.6 times faster point lookups and 2.7 times higher overall throughput compared to the SOTA method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edfLSM\u6811\u8303\u56f4\u5220\u9664\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8303\u56f4\u5893\u7891\u65b9\u6848\u5f71\u54cd\u70b9\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGLORAN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8303\u56f4\u5220\u9664\u548c\u70b9\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709LSM\u6811\u8303\u56f4\u5220\u9664\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8303\u56f4\u5893\u7891\u65b9\u6848\u5f71\u54cd\u70b9\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGLORAN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u7d22\u5f15\u964d\u4f4eI/O\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6761\u76ee\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "GLORAN\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u70b9\u67e5\u8be2\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u5feb10.6\u500d\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u9ad82.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "GLORAN\u80fd\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u4ee3LSM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u70b9\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5220\u9664\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Diffolio, a diffusion model designed for multivariate financial time-series forecasting and portfolio construction. Diffolio employs a denoising network with a hierarchical attention architecture, comprising both asset-level and market-level layers. Furthermore, to better reflect cross-sectional correlations, we introduce a correlation-guided regularizer informed by a stable estimate of the target correlation matrix. This structure effectively extracts salient features not only from historical returns but also from asset-specific and systematic covariates, significantly enhancing the performance of forecasts and portfolios. Experimental results on the daily excess returns of 12 industry portfolios show that Diffolio outperforms various probabilistic forecasting baselines in multivariate forecasting accuracy and portfolio performance. Moreover, in portfolio experiments, portfolios constructed from Diffolio's forecasts show consistently robust performance, thereby outperforming those from benchmarks by achieving higher Sharpe ratios for the mean-variance tangency portfolio and higher certainty equivalents for the growth-optimal portfolio.

However, when it comes to the sparse training of SNNs in the structural connection domain, existing methods fail to achieve ultra-sparse network structures without significant performance loss, thereby hindering progress in energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. This limitation presents a critical challenge: how to achieve high levels of structural connection sparsity while maintaining performance comparable to fully connected networks. To address this challenge, we propose the Cannistraci-Hebb Spiking Neural Network (CH-SNN), a novel and generalizable dynamic sparse training framework for SNNs consisting of four stages. First, we propose a sparse spike correlated topological initialization (SSCTI) method to initialize a sparse network based on node correlations. Second, temporal activation sparsity and structural connection sparsity are integrated via a proposed sparse spike weight initialization (SSWI) method. Third, a hybrid link removal score (LRS) is applied to prune redundant weights and inactive neurons, improving information flow. Finally, the CH3-L3 network automaton framework inspired by Cannistraci-Hebb learning theory is incorporated to perform link prediction for potential synaptic regrowth. These mechanisms enable CH-SNN to achieve sparsification across all linear layers.

By studying the influence of hyperpriors on the solution of EBF, we establish a theoretical connection between the choice of the hyperprior and the sparsity as well as the local optimality of the resulting solutions. We show that some strictly increasing hyperpriors, such as half-Laplace and half-generalized Gaussian with the power in $(0,1)$, effectively promote sparsity and improve solution stability with respect to measurement noise. Based on this analysis, we adopt a proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm with convergence guaranties for both convex and concave hyperpriors. Extensive numerical tests on two-dimensional image deblurring problems demonstrate that introducing appropriate hyperpriors significantly promotes the sparsity of the solution and enhances restoration accuracy.

This abstraction enables the automatic parallelization of sequentially-dependent loops, as well as data movement optimizations including software prefetching and pointer incrementation to reduce register spills.

No Problem: Query Strategies for Unpriced Information", "categories": ["cs.DS", "cs.CC"], "comment": "43 pages", "summary": "The classic *priced query model*, introduced by Charikar et al. (STOC 2000), captures the task of computing a known function on an unknown input when each input variable can only be revealed by paying an associated cost. The goal is to design a query strategy that determines the function's value while minimizing the total cost incurred. However, all prior work in this model assumes complete advance knowledge of the query costs -- an assumption that fails in many realistic settings.\n  We introduce a variant of the priced query model that explicitly handles *unknown* variable costs. We prove a separation from the traditional priced query model, showing that uncertainty in variable costs imposes an unavoidable overhead for every query strategy. Despite this, we design strategies that essentially match our lower bound and are competitive with the best cost-aware strategies for arbitrary Boolean functions.

This paper presents IMDMR (Intelligent Multi-Dimensional Memory Retrieval), a novel system that addresses these limitations through a multi-dimensional search architecture. Unlike existing memory systems that rely on single-dimensional approaches, IMDMR leverages six distinct memory dimensions-semantic, entity, category, intent, context, and temporal-to provide comprehensive memory retrieval capabilities. Our system incorporates intelligent query processing with dynamic strategy selection, cross-memory entity resolution, and advanced memory integration techniques. Through comprehensive evaluation against five baseline systems including LangChain RAG, LlamaIndex, MemGPT, and spaCy + RAG, IMDMR achieves a 3.8x improvement in overall performance (0.792 vs 0.207 for the best baseline). We present both simulated (0.314) and production (0.792) implementations, demonstrating the importance of real technology integration while maintaining superiority over all baseline systems. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-dimensional search, with the full system outperforming individual dimension approaches by 23.3%. Query-type analysis reveals superior performance across all categories, particularly for preferences/interests (0.630) and goals/aspirations (0.630) queries. Comprehensive visualizations and statistical analysis confirm the significance of these improvements with p < 0.001 across all metrics.

In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems.

However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals.

Although more flexible and generalizable than conventional models, the practical use of these approaches remains limited by scalability due to the cost of calling one LLM for every traveler. Moreover, it has been found that LLM agents often make opaque choices and produce unstable day-to-day dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose to model each homogeneous traveler group facing the same decision context with a single representative LLM agent who behaves like the population's average, maintaining and updating a mixed strategy over routes that coincides with the group's aggregate flow proportions. Each day, the LLM reviews the travel experience and flags routes with positive reinforcement that they hope to use more often, and an interpretable update rule then converts this judgment into strategy adjustments using a tunable (progressively decaying) step size. The representative-agent design improves scalability, while the separation of reasoning from updating clarifies the decision logic while stabilizing learning.

Each memory is a time-semantic-relational entity-a structure that simultaneously encodes when an event occurred, what it means, and how it connects to other events. Built initially atop PostgreSQL with pgvector extensions, MemoriesDB combines the properties of a time-series datastore, a vector database, and a graph system within a single append-only schema. Each memory is represented as a vertex uniquely labeled by its microsecond timestamp and accompanied by low- and high-dimensional normalized embeddings that capture semantic context. Directed edges between memories form labeled relations with per-edge metadata, enabling multiple contextual links between the same vertices. Together these constructs form a time-indexed stack of temporal-semantic surfaces, where edges project as directional arrows in a 1+1-dimensional similarity field, tracing the evolution of meaning through time while maintaining cross-temporal coherence. This formulation supports efficient time-bounded retrieval, hybrid semantic search, and lightweight structural reasoning in a single query path.

Using NBBO event-time data for about 1,500 regular trading days, we form for every lag L ordered pairs of a backward price increment (\"push\") and a forward price increment (\"response\"), standardize them, and estimate the expected responses on a fine grid of push magnitudes. The resulting lag-by-magnitude maps reveal a persistent structural shift: for short lags (1-5,000 ticks), expected responses cluster near zero across most push magnitudes, suggesting high short-term efficiency; beyond that range, pronounced tails emerge, indicating that larger historical pushes increasingly correlate with nonzero conditional responses. We also find that large negative pushes are followed by stronger positive responses than equally large positive pushes, consistent with asymmetric liquidity replenishment after sell-side shocks.

We focus on the small-Biot-number regime. The problem is accurately described by the conjugate heat transfer (CHT) formulation, which couples the Navier-Stokes and energy equations in the fluid with the heat equation in the solid through interfacial continuity conditions. Because full CHT simulations are computationally expensive, simplified models are often used in practice. Starting from the coupled equations, we systematically reduce the formulation to the lumped-capacitance model, a single ordinary differential equation with a closed-form solution, based on two assumptions: time scale separation and a spatially uniform solid temperature. The total modeling error is decomposed into time homogenization and lumping contributions. We derive an asymptotic error bound for the lumping error, valid for general heterogeneous solids and spatially varying heat transfer coefficients. Building on this theoretical result, we introduce a computable upper bound expressed in measurable quantities for practical evaluation. Time scale separation is analyzed theoretically and supported by physical arguments and simulations, showing that large separation yields small time homogenization errors. In practice, the Biot number must be estimated from so-called empirical correlations, which are typically limited to specific canonical geometries. We propose a data-driven framework that extends empirical correlations to a broader range of geometries through learned characteristic length scales.

GenAI can potentially both enable previously unviable entrepreneurial ideas by lowering resource needs and improve the performance of existing ventures. We explore how founders' technical and managerial expertise shapes GenAI's impact on digital ventures along these dimensions. Exploiting exogenous variation in GenAI usage across venture categories and the timing of its broad availability for software tasks (e.g., GitHub Copilot's public release and subsequent GenAI tools), we find that the number of new venture launches increased and the median time to launch decreased significantly more in categories with relatively high GenAI usage. GenAI's effect on new launches is larger for founders without managerial experience or education, while its effect on venture capital (VC) funding likelihood is stronger for founders with technical experience or education.

If the trees $T_i$ are sub-graphs of $G$, the tree cover is called a spanning tree cover. If these trees are HSTs, it is called an HST cover.\n  In a seminal work, Mendel and Naor [2006] showed that for any parameter $k=1,2,...$, there exists an HST cover, and a non-spanning tree cover, with stretch $O(k)$ and with $O(kn^{\\frac{1}{k}})$ trees. Abraham et al. [2020] devised a spanning version of this result, albeit with stretch $O(k\\log\\log n)$. For graphs of small treewidth $t$, Gupta et al. [2004] devised an exact spanning tree cover with $O(t\\log n)$ trees, and Chang et al. [2-23] devised a $(1+\u03b5)$-approximate non-spanning tree cover with $2^{(t/\u03b5)^{O(t)}}$ trees.\n  We prove a smooth tradeoff between the stretch and the number of trees for graphs with balanced recursive separators of size at most $s(n)$ or treewidth at most $t(n)$.

The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness.

DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation.

We consider both discrete and continuous allocation models and examine two types of aggregate objectives: linear aggregation and worst-case battlefield value. For each setting, we analyze the existence and computability of Nash equilibrium. The general problem is not convex-concave, which limits the applicability of standard convex optimization techniques.

Traditional methods require re-execution for each parameter configuration, leading to prohibitive costs when objective evaluations are computationally expensive. To address this issue, we propose Parametric Pareto Set Learning with multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (PPSL-MOBO), a novel framework that learns a unified mapping from both preferences and parameters to Pareto-optimal solutions. PPSL-MOBO leverages a hypernetwork with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently capture parametric variations, while integrating Gaussian process surrogates and hypervolume-based acquisition to minimize expensive function evaluations. We demonstrate PPSL-MOBO's effectiveness on two challenging applications: multi-objective optimization with shared components, where certain design variables must be identical across solution families due to modular constraints, and dynamic multi-objective optimization, where objectives evolve over time. Unlike existing methods that cannot directly solve PMO problems in a unified manner, PPSL-MOBO learns a single model that generalizes across the entire parameter space.

However, most benchmarks emphasize what to fix rather than how to fix code. We introduce \\textsc{SWE-fficiency}, a benchmark for evaluating repository-level performance optimization on real workloads. Our suite contains 498 tasks across nine widely used data-science, machine-learning, and HPC repositories (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy): given a complete codebase and a slow workload, an agent must investigate code semantics, localize bottlenecks and relevant tests, and produce a patch that matches or exceeds expert speedup while passing the same unit tests. To enable this how-to-fix evaluation, our automated pipeline scrapes GitHub pull requests for performance-improving edits, combining keyword filtering, static analysis, coverage tooling, and execution validation to both confirm expert speedup baselines and identify relevant repository unit tests.

However, effective Monte Carlo algorithms for inference with these models have not yet been established, except for several simple cases. In this study, we show that, compared with the slow inference achieved with existing program libraries, the performance of Riemannian-manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC) can be drastically improved by optimising the computation order according to the model structure and dynamically programming the eigendecomposition. This improvement cannot be achieved when using an existing library based on a naive automatic differentiator. We numerically demonstrate that RMHMC effectively samples from the posterior, allowing the calculation of model evidence, in a Bayesian logistic regression on simulated data and in the estimation of propensity functions for the American national medical expenditure data using several Bayesian multiple-kernel models.

We exploit quasi-random variation in multi-threshold criteria utilized for classifying Census Towns (CTs) and focus on settlements near the thresholds that are likely to obtain statutory recognition. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we instrument for urban local governance to identify the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE). We document a strong first stage relationship between meeting CT thresholds and statutory recognition. Our results show that obtaining an Urban Local Body (ULB) increases local public good provision: government schools increase by approximately 14 (primary), 8 (middle), and 5 (secondary), healthcare infrastructure expands by 2 hospitals and 3 family welfare centers, and financial access deepens with 15 private banks, 2 cooperative banks, and 2 agricultural credit societies. Community amenities improve modestly with an additional public library, reading room, and cinema hall. Sports infrastructure declines by 5 facilities, consistent with our understanding of reallocation of urban space and investments.

However, the presence of discrete mass makes posterior inference challenging. \"Sticky\" extensions to piecewise-deterministic Markov process samplers have shown promising performance, where sampling from the spike is achieved by the process sticking there for an exponentially distributed duration. As it turns out, the sampler remains valid when the exponential sticking time is replaced with its expectation. We justify this by mapping the spike to a continuous density over a latent universe, allowing the sampler to be reinterpreted as traversing this universe while being stuck in the original space. This perspective opens up an array of possibilities to carry out posterior computation under spike-and-slab type priors. Notably, it enables us to construct sticky samplers using other dynamics-based paradigms such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and, in fact, original sticky process can be established as a partial position-momentum refreshment limit of our Hamiltonian sticky sampler.

Grids have managed the resulting surges by scaling generation capacity, incorporating additional resources such as solar and wind, and implementing demand-response mechanisms. Altogether, these policies influence a region's carbon intensity by affecting its energy mix. To mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption, carbon-aware optimizations often rely on long-horizon, high-accuracy forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity that typically use compute intensive models with extensive historical energy mix data. In addition to limiting scalability, accuracy improvements do not necessarily translate into proportional increases in savings. Highlighting the need for more efficient forecasting strategies, we argue that carbon forecasting solutions can achieve the majority of savings without requiring highly precise and complex predictions. Instead, it is the preservation of the ranking of forecasts relative to the ground-truth that drives realized savings. In this paper, we present LiteCast, a lightweight time series forecasting method capable of quickly modeling a region's energy mix to estimate its carbon intensity. LiteCast requires only a few days of historical energy and weather data, delivering fast forecasts that can quickly adapt to sudden changes in the electrical grid. Our evaluation in 50 worldwide regions under various real-world workloads shows that LiteCast outperforms state-of-the-art forecasters, delivering 20% higher savings with near-optimal performance, achieving 97% of the maximum attainable average savings, while remaining lightweight, efficient to run, and adaptive to new data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u7535\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7535\u7f51\u91c7\u53d6\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5LiteCast\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8282\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u8282\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5LiteCast\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u51e0\u5929\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u7535\u7f51\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u740350\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cLiteCast\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u8282\u80fd20%\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u8282\u80fd\u768497%\u3002", "conclusion": "LiteCast\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce a new rule, called \\emph{color swapping}, where two adjacent vertices may exchange their colors, so that the resulting coloring remains proper, and study the computational complexity of the problem under this rule. We first establish a complexity dichotomy with respect to $k$: the problem is solvable in polynomial time for $k \\leq 2$, and is PSPACE-complete for $k \\geq 3$. We further show that the problem remains PSPACE-complete even on restricted graph classes, including bipartite graphs, split graphs, and planar graphs of bounded degree.

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes.

In this work, we introduce Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a novel test-time scaling method tailored to discrete diffusion that leverages reward-guided noising-denoising transitions to progressively refine misaligned intermediate states. We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution.

Unlike traditional goods, content from one domain can enhance the training and performance of GenAI models in other domains. For example, OpenAI's video generation model Sora (Liu et al., 2024b) relies heavily on image data to improve video generation quality. In this work, we study nonlinear procurement mechanism design under data transferability, where online platforms employ both human creators and GenAI to satisfy cross-domain content demand. We propose optimal mechanisms that maximize either platform revenue or social welfare and identify the specific properties of GenAI that make such high-dimensional design problems tractable. Our analysis further reveals which domains face stronger competitive pressure and which tend to experience overproduction. Moreover, the growing role of data intermediaries, including labeling companies such as Scale AI and creator organizations such as The Wall Street Journal, introduces a third layer into the traditional platform-creator structure. We show that this three-layer market can result in a lose-lose outcome, reducing both platform revenue and social welfare, as large pre-signed contracts distort creators' incentives and lead to inefficiencies in the data market.

This paper introduces AgriTrust, a federated semantic governance framework designed to resolve this paradox. AgriTrust integrates a multi-stakeholder governance model, built on pillars of Data Sovereignty, Transparent Data Contracts, Equitable Value Sharing, and Regulatory Compliance, with a semantic digital layer. This layer is realized through the AgriTrust Core Ontology, a formal OWL ontology that provides a shared vocabulary for tokenization, traceability, and certification, enabling true semantic interoperability across independent platforms. A key innovation is a blockchain-agnostic, multi-provider architecture that prevents vendor lock-in.

This scarcity leads to high epistemic uncertainty in surrogate predictions. Conventional surrogate methods such as Kriging assume Gaussian distributions, which can yield suboptimal results when the assumptions fail. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet novel dual-ranking strategy, working with a basic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, NSGA-II, where the built-in non-dominated sorting is kept and the second rank is devised for uncertainty estimation. In the latter, we utilize the uncertainty estimates given by several surrogate models, including Quantile Regression (QR), Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Concretely, with this dual-ranking strategy, each solution's final rank is the average of its non-dominated sorting rank and a rank derived from the uncertainty-adjusted fitness function, thus reducing the risk of misguided optimization under data constraints. We evaluate our approach on benchmark and real-world MOPs, comparing it to state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our dual-ranking strategy significantly improves the performance of NSGA-II in offline settings, achieving competitive outcomes compared with traditional surrogate-based methods.

To address these challenges, we propose WAR-Re, an LLM-based model for Web API recommendation with semantic reasoning for justification.

Current methods often struggle to balance the competing demands of interpretability and model flexibility, limiting their effectiveness in extracting meaningful insights from complex data. We introduce Non-negative Stiefel Approximating Flow (NSA-Flow), a general-purpose matrix estimation framework that unifies ideas from sparse matrix factorization, orthogonalization, and constrained manifold learning. NSA-Flow enforces structured sparsity through a continuous balance between reconstruction fidelity and column-wise decorrelation, parameterized by a single tunable weight. The method operates as a smooth flow near the Stiefel manifold with proximal updates for non-negativity and adaptive gradient control, yielding representations that are simultaneously sparse, stable, and interpretable. Unlike classical regularization schemes, NSA-Flow provides an intuitive geometric mechanism for manipulating sparsity at the level of global structure while simplifying latent features. We demonstrate that the NSA-Flow objective can be optimized smoothly and integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines for dimensionality reduction while improving interpretability and generalization in both simulated and real biomedical data. Empirical validation on the Golub leukemia dataset and in Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that the NSA-Flow constraints can maintain or improve performance over related methods with little additional methodological effort.

Using a simple model, I show that an acquisitive ASI refrains from full predation under surprisingly weak conditions. When humans can flee to rivals, inter-ASI competition creates a market that tempers predation. When trapped by a monopolist ASI, its \"encompassing interest\" in humanity's output makes it a rational autocrat rather than a ravager. And when the ASI has no long-term stake, our ability to withhold future output incentivizes it to trade on credit rather than steal. In each extension, humanity's welfare progressively worsens.

This limitation arises in many physics problems, such as Mixture Models (MM) with an unknown number of components or the inference of overlapping signals in noisy data, as in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Global Fit problem. Traditional approaches, such as product-space methods or Reversible-Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), often face efficiency and convergence limitations. This paper presents samsara, a Continuous-Time Markov Chain Monte Carlo (CTMCMC) framework that models parameter evolution through Poisson-driven birth, death, and mutation processes. samsara is designed to sample models of unknown dimensionality. By requiring detailed balance through adaptive rate definitions, CTMCMC achieves automatic acceptance of trans-dimensional moves and high sampling efficiency. The code features waiting time weighted estimators, optimized memory storage, and a modular design for easy customization.

To meet diverse demands from varying-length requests in online services, existing state-of-the-art systems tune the sequence parallelism (SP) allocation. However, current dynamic SP allocation lacks flexibility to (1) support stage-specific parallelism requirements in LLM inference, (2) mitigate the global latency degradation from excessive SP allocation, and (3) exploit resource fragments arising from SP size variation.\n  To tackle this problem, we propose Chunkwise Dynamic Sequence Parallelism (CDSP), a fine-grained parallelism strategy that assigns SP sizes across \\textit{intra-request} token segments. Based on CDSP, we build Tetris, an LLM serving system that (1) efficiently integrates CDSP into disaggregated cluster to satisfy parallelism heterogeneity, (2) dynamically regulates SP size expansion based on real-time load conditions, and (3) adaptively explores chunking plans to utilize fragmented resources while meeting per-request demands.

Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements.

In this paper, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that integrates advanced soft computing techniques - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) - to address the multidimensional challenges of predictive maintenance in complex manufacturing systems. Specifically, the proposed framework innovatively combines the powerful frequency-domain representation capability of FNOs to capture high-dimensional temporal patterns; DAEs to achieve robust, noise-resistant latent state embedding from complex non-Gaussian sensor data; and GNNs to accurately represent inter-device dependencies for coordinated system-wide maintenance decisions. Furthermore, by exploiting PPO, the framework ensures stable and efficient optimisation of long-term maintenance strategies to effectively handle uncertainty and non-stationary dynamics. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach significantly outperforms multiple deep learning baseline models with up to 13% cost reduction, as well as strong convergence and inter-module synergy.

While qualitative studies highlight the potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with traditional optimization, a formal, quantitative demonstration of this synergy is lacking. This paper introduces a novel stochastic learning-optimization framework that integrates Bayesian inference with inventory optimization for supply chain management (SCM). We model a two-echelon inventory system subject to stochastic demand and supply disruptions, comparing a traditional static optimization policy against an adaptive policy where Bayesian learning continuously updates parameter estimates to inform stochastic optimization. Our simulations over 365 periods across three operational scenarios demonstrate that the integrated approach achieves 7.4\\% cost reduction in stable environments and 5.7\\% improvement during supply disruptions, while revealing important limitations during sudden demand shocks due to the inherent conservatism of Bayesian updating.

Using panel data from Major League Baseball (MLB), this study examines how superstar presence affects teammates' opportunities and career outcomes. To address potential endogeneity in team composition, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in superstar availability caused by injuries. When a superstar is active in the same team-position unit, non-star teammates play significantly less. These short-term reductions in playing time extend to longer horizons: players who begin their careers alongside a superstar who remains active for a full season (i.e., not on the injured list) are about 1.7 times more likely to exit MLB earlier than comparable peers. A key mechanism is reduced skill development -- limited playing opportunities hinder subsequent growth in offensive performance. At the team level, greater dependence on superstars raises immediate productivity but magnifies performance declines after their departure, indicating a trade-off between short-term success and long-term adaptability. Overall, the findings suggest that while concentrating key roles in top performers boosts output in the short run, it can restrict others' development and retention.

We introduce a SAT-based alternative that encodes fibers as Boolean circuits which allows modern SAT samplers to generate tables randomly. We analyze the sampling bias that SAT samplers may introduce, provide diagnostics, and propose practical mitigation. We propose hybrid MCMC schemes that combine SAT proposals with local moves to ensure correct stationary distributions which do not necessarily require connectivity via local moves which is particularly beneficial in presence of structural zeros.

Results show that PRAGMA consistently outperforms baseline AIKG without profiling enabled and achieves 2.81$\\times$ and 2.30$\\times$ averaged speedups against Torch on CPU and GPU platforms, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPRAGMA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728KernelBench\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5185\u6838\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6216\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e95\u5c42\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PRAGMA\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u786c\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u5386\u53f2\u6700\u4f73\u7248\u672c\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728KernelBench\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cPRAGMA\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u542f\u7528\u5206\u6790\u7684\u57fa\u7ebfAIKG\uff0c\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u6bd4Torch\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u901f2.81\u500d\u548c2.30\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PRAGMA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5185\u6838\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The algorithm was originally introduced by Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani [STOC 1990] for the online bipartite matching problem with one-sided vertex arrivals, where it achieves a tight approximation ratio of 1 - 1/e. It was later extended to general graphs by Goel and Tripathi [FOCS 2012]. The Ranking algorithm for general graphs is as follows: a permutation $\u03c3$ over the vertices is chosen uniformly at random. The vertices are then processed sequentially according to this order, with each vertex being matched to the first available neighbor (if any) according to the same permutation $\u03c3$.\n  While the algorithm is quite well-understood for bipartite graphs-with the approximation ratio lying between 0.696 and 0.727, its approximation ratio for general graphs remains less well characterized despite extensive efforts. Prior to this work, the best known lower bound for general graphs was 0.526 by Chan et al. [TALG 2018], improving on the approximation ratio of 0.523 by Chan et al. [SICOMP 2018]. The upper bound, however, remains the same as that for bipartite graphs.\n  In this work, we improve the approximation ratio of \\textsc{Ranking} for general graphs to 0.5469, up from 0.526. This also surpasses the best-known approximation ratio of $0.531$ by Tang et al. [JACM 2023] for the oblivious matching problem. Our approach builds on the standard primal-dual analysis. The novelty of our work lies in proving new structural properties of Ranking by introducing the notion of the backup for vertices matched by the algorithm. For a fixed permutation, a vertex's backup is its potential match if its current match is removed. This concept helps characterize the rank distribution of the match of each vertex, enabling us to eliminate certain bad events that constrained previous work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76Ranking\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4ece0.526\u63d0\u5347\u52300.5469\u3002", "motivation": "Ranking\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u7279\u5f81\u672a\u5145\u5206\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u6700\u597d\u4e0b\u754c\u4e3a0.526\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u539f\u59cb - \u5bf9\u5076\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9876\u70b9\u5907\u4efd\u6982\u5ff5\u8bc1\u660eRanking\u65b0\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u5c06Ranking\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u63d0\u5347\u52300.5469\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86Tang\u7b49\u4eba\u5728\u65e0\u611f\u77e5\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5df2\u77e5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd40.531\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9876\u70b9\u5907\u4efd\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u4e4b\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Ranking\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u3002"}}

Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution.

Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance while matching or surpassing KL-DRO.

We investigate this question by extending Causal Normal Form Games (CNFGs) to sequential settings, introducing Sequential Causal Multi-Agent Systems (S-CMAS) that incorporate Pearl's Causal Hierarchy across leader-follower interactions. While theoretically elegant -- we prove PSPACE-completeness, develop equilibrium refinements, and establish connections to signaling theory -- our comprehensive empirical investigation reveals a critical limitation: S-CNE provides zero welfare improvement over classical Stackelberg equilibrium across all tested scenarios. Through 50+ Monte Carlo simulations and hand-crafted synthetic examples, we demonstrate that backward induction with rational best-response eliminates any strategic advantage from causal layer distinctions. We construct a theoretical example illustrating conditions where benefits could emerge ($\u03b5$-rational satisficing followers), though implementation confirms that even relaxed rationality assumptions prove insufficient when good instincts align with optimal play. This negative result provides valuable insight: classical game-theoretic extensions grounded in rational choice are fundamentally incompatible with causal reasoning advantages, motivating new theoretical frameworks beyond standard Nash equilibrium for agentic AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7ecf\u5178\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5426\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u6355\u6349AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51faS - CMAS\u4f46\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u65e0\u798f\u5229\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u7ecf\u5178\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5426\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u6355\u6349AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Causal Normal Form Games\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e8f\u8d2f\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165S - CMAS\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c50 +\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u5408\u6210\u793a\u4f8b\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "S - CNE\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178Stackelberg\u5747\u8861\u65e0\u798f\u5229\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u9006\u5411\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u7406\u6027\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u5c42\u5dee\u5f02\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6218\u7565\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u653e\u677e\u7406\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e5f\u4e0d\u8db3\u591f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u52bf\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models.

Often, the dependence of the solution of the ODE on additional parameters is of interest, e.g.\\ when dealing with uncertainty quantification or design optimization. Directly studying this dependence can quickly become too computationally expensive, such that cheaper surrogate models approximating the solution are of interest. One popular class of surrogate models are Gaussian processes (GPs). They perform well when approximating stationary functions, functions which have a similar level of variation along any given parameter direction, however solutions to stiff ODEs are often characterized by a mixture of regions of rapid and slow variation along the time axis and when dealing with such nonstationary functions, GP performance frequently degrades drastically. We therefore aim to reparameterize stiff ODE solutions based on the available data, to make them appear more stationary and hence recover good GP performance. This approach comes with minimal computational overhead and requires no internal changes to the GP implementation, as it can be seen as a separate preprocessing step.

A prominent example is NSGA-III, which is particularly well suited for solving problems involving more than three objectives, distinguishing it from the classical NSGA-II. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of NSGA III remains very limited, especially with respect to runtime analysis. A central open problem concerns its population dynamics, which involve controlling the maximum number of individuals sharing the same fitness value during the exploration process. In this paper, we make a significant step towards such an understanding by proving tight runtime bounds for NSGA-III on the bi-objective OneMinMax ($2$-OMM) problem. Firstly, we prove that NSGA-III requires $\u03a9(n^2 \\log(n) / \u03bc)$ generations in expectation to optimize $2$-OMM assuming the population size $\u03bc$ satisfies $n+1 \\leq \u03bc=O(\\log(n)^c(n+1))$ where $n$ denotes the problem size and $c<1$ is a constant. Apart from~\\cite{opris2025multimodal}, this is the first proven lower runtime bound for NSGA-III on a classical benchmark problem. Complementing this, we secondly improve the best known upper bound of NSGA-III on the $m$-objective OneMinMax problem ($m$-OMM) of $O(n \\log(n))$ generations by a factor of $\u03bc/(2n/m + 1)^{m/2}$ for a constant number $m$ of objectives and population size $(2n/m + 1)^{m/2} \\leq \u03bc\\in O(\\sqrt{\\log(n)} (2n/m + 1)^{m/2})$. This yields tight runtime bounds in the case $m = 2$, and the surprising result that NSGA-III beats NSGA-II by a factor of $\u03bc/n$ in the expected runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

One promising approach to address this issue is the watermark technique, which embeds subtle statistical signals into LLM-generated text to enable reliable identification. In this paper, we first generalize the likelihood-based LLM detection method of a previous study by introducing a flexible weighted formulation, and further adapt this approach to the inverse transform sampling method. Moving beyond watermark detection, we extend this adaptive detection strategy to tackle the more challenging problem of segmenting a given text into watermarked and non-watermarked substrings. In contrast to the approach in a previous study, which relies on accurate estimation of next-token probabilities that are highly sensitive to prompt estimation, our proposed framework removes the need for precise prompt estimation. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology is both effective and robust in accurately segmenting texts containing a mixture of watermarked and non-watermarked content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u7075\u6d3b\u52a0\u6743\u516c\u5f0f\u63a8\u5e7f\u4f3c\u7136\u68c0\u6d4b\u6cd5\u5e76\u9002\u914d\u9006\u53d8\u6362\u91c7\u6837\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u6587\u672c\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u5feb\u901f\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u9700\u533a\u5206\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u64b0\u5199\u5185\u5bb9\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u6ee5\u7528\uff0c\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u662f\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7075\u6d3b\u52a0\u6743\u516c\u5f0f\u63a8\u5e7f\u4f3c\u7136\u68c0\u6d4b\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u9006\u53d8\u6362\u91c7\u6837\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u6587\u672c\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u7cbe\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u4f30\u8ba1\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5272\u542b\u6c34\u5370\u548c\u975e\u6c34\u5370\u6df7\u5408\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u542b\u6c34\u5370\u548c\u975e\u6c34\u5370\u6df7\u5408\u6587\u672c\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We exploit idiosyncratic variation introduced by the recommendation algorithm to identify and separately value these components as well as to recover model-free diversion ratios that we can use to validate our structural model. We use the model to evaluate counterfactuals that quantify the incremental engagement generated by personalized recommendations. First, we show that replacing the current recommender system with a matrix factorization or popularity-based algorithm would lead to 4% and 12% reduction in engagement, respectively, and decreased consumption diversity.

However, privacy concerns often present significant barriers to the integrative analysis of such multi-source data. Classical meta-learning, which averages local estimates to derive the final ITR, is frequently suboptimal due to biases in these local estimates. To address these challenges, we propose a convolution-smoothed weighted support vector machine for learning the optimal ITR. The accompanying loss function is both convex and smooth, which allows us to develop an efficient multi-round distributed learning procedure for ITRs. Such distributed learning ensures optimal statistical performance with a fixed number of communication rounds, thereby minimizing coordination costs across data centers while preserving data privacy. Our method avoids pooling subject-level raw data and instead requires only sharing summary statistics. Additionally, we develop an efficient coordinate gradient descent algorithm, which guarantees at least linear convergence for the resulting optimization problem.

Despite these benefits, challenges such as startup latencies, static configurations, sub-optimal resource allocation and scheduling still exist due to coupled resource offering and workload-agnostic generic scheduling behaviour. These issues often lead to inconsistent function performance and unexpected operational costs for users and service providers. This paper introduces Saarthi, a novel, end-to-end serverless framework that intelligently manages the dynamic resource needs of function workloads, representing a significant step toward self-driving serverless platforms. Unlike platforms that rely on static resource configurations, Saarthi is input-aware, allowing it to intelligently anticipate resource requirements based on the characteristics of an incoming request payload. This input-driven approach reinforces function right-sizing and enables smart request orchestration across available function configurations. Saarthi further integrates a proactive fault-tolerant redundancy mechanism and employs a multi-objective Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to maintain an optimal function quantity. This optimisation aims to maximise system throughput while simultaneously reducing overall operational costs. We validate the effectiveness of Saarthi by implementing it as a framework atop OpenFaaS. Our results demonstrate Saarthi's ability to achieve up to 1.45x better throughput, 1.84x reduced costs, while maintaining up to 98.3% service level targets with an overhead of up to 0.2 seconds as compared to the baseline OpenFaaS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6846\u67b6Saarthi\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u667a\u80fd\u7ba1\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5bb9\u9519\u673a\u5236\u548cILP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728OpenFaaS\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709FaaS\u5b58\u5728\u542f\u52a8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9759\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u610f\u5916\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8f93\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u7684Saarthi\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bb9\u9519\u5197\u4f59\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08ILP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenFaaS\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0Saarthi\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53471.45\u500d\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e1.84\u500d\uff0c\u4fdd\u630198.3%\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u591a0.2\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "Saarthi\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

A switch with $n$ output ports receives a stream of incoming packets. When an incoming packet is accepted by the switch, it is stored in a shared buffer of capacity $B$ common to all packets and awaits its transmission through its corresponding output port determined by its destination. Each output port transmits one packet per time unit. The problem is to find an algorithm for the switch to accept or reject a packet upon its arrival in order to maximize the total number of transmitted packets.\n  Building on the work of Kesselman et al. (STOC 2001) on split buffer sharing, Kesselman and Mansour (TCS 2004) considered the problem of online buffer sharing which models most deployed internet switches. In their work, they presented the Harmonic policy and proved that it is $(2 + \\ln n)$-competitive, which is the best known competitive ratio for this problem. The Harmonic policy unfortunately saw less practical relevance as it performs $n$ threshold checks per packets which is deemed costly in practice, especially on network switches processing multiple terabits of packets per second. While the Harmonic policy is elegant, the original proof is also rather complex and involves a lengthy matching routine along with multiple intermediary results.\n  This note presents a simplified Harmonic policy, both in terms of implementation and proof.

This work explores whether it is possible to predict Oscar nominations for screenplays using modern language models. Since no suitable dataset was available, a new one called Movie-O-Label was created by combining the MovieSum collection of movie scripts with curated Oscar records. Each screenplay was represented by its title, Wikipedia summary, and full script. Long scripts were split into overlapping text chunks and encoded with the E5 sentence em bedding model. Then, the screenplay embed dings were classified using a logistic regression model. The best results were achieved when three feature inputs related to screenplays (script, summary, and title) were combined. The best-performing model reached a macro F1 score of 0.66, a precision recall AP of 0.445 with baseline 0.19 and a ROC-AUC of 0.79.

However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors.

Fuel distributors specifically require precise estimates to avoid inventory shortages or excesses.

In this research, we evaluate the performance of data-driven approaches using a substantial amount of data obtained from a major aviation fuel distributor in the Danish market. Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies.

Every agent must receive exactly one resource. We study algorithmic approaches towards ensuring fairness in such settings. Minimizing the number of envious agents is known to be NP-complete (Kamiyama et al. 2021). We present two tractable approaches to deal with the computational hardness. When the agents are presented with an initial allocation of houses, we aim to refine this allocation by reallocating a bounded number of houses to reduce the number of envious agents. We show an efficient algorithm when the agents express preference for a bounded number of houses.

For both algorithms, the known runtime guarantees are linear in the population size; for the NSGA-II, matching lower bounds exist. With a careful study of the more complex selection mechanism of the SPEA2, we show that it has very different population dynamics. From these, we prove runtime guarantees for the OneMinMax, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump benchmarks that depend less on the population size. For example, we show that the SPEA2 with parent population size $\u03bc\\ge n - 2k + 3$ and offspring population size $\u03bb$ computes the Pareto front of the OneJumpZeroJump benchmark with gap size $k$ in an expected number of $O( (\u03bb+\u03bc)n + n^{k+1})$ function evaluations. This shows that the best runtime guarantee of $O(n^{k+1})$ is not only achieved for $\u03bc= \u0398(n)$ and $\u03bb= O(n)$ but for arbitrary $\u03bc, \u03bb= O(n^k)$.

In terms of data analysis, the system proposed a debugging behavior analysis model based on abstract syntax tree, combined with node annotation, sequence recognition and cluster analysis and other technologies, to automatically track the context of students' debugging process and accurately identify key features in the debugging path. Through this tool, the system realizes the intelligent identification and labeling of the debugging direction and behavior pattern, and improves the refinement level of debugging data analysis. In this research system, a complex debugging scenario of multi-file and multi-task is introduced into the debugging problem design, which optimizes the multi-dimensional capturing ability of debugging data and lays a foundation for accurate debugging behavior analysis.

Improvements to random forests, such as applying Lasso regression to the tree predictions, have been proposed in order to reduce model bias. However, these changes can sometimes degrade performance (e.g., an increase in mean squared error). In this paper, we show in theory that the relative performance of these two methods, standard and Lasso-weighted random forests, depends on the signal-to-noise ratio.

While such depth promotes efficiency, it may also limit adaptability in complex and rapidly changing environments. Building on research showing that variability in training inputs enhances learning outcomes across cognitive and behavioral domains, this study explores whether the same principle applies to executive performance.\n  Using an original dataset of 650 CEOs leading firms that together represent roughly 85% of US market capitalization, we construct a composite Breadth Index capturing cross-domain educational and professional breadth. Preliminary analyses reveal that firms led by higher-breadth CEOs outperform their industry peers by an average of 9.8 percentage points over a three-year window. Regression results indicate that each one-point increase on the five-point Range Index corresponds to a 1.8-point gain in abnormal returns (p < 0.03), with effects remaining robust across industries, firm sizes, and CEO age groups.\n  These early findings suggest that leadership breadth, defined as experience spanning multiple functions, disciplines, and sectors, is positively associated with firm-level performance. While the dataset remains under validation, the pattern observed supports the emerging view that as specialization deepens, the marginal value of lateral insight rises. Breadth, in this light, functions as a form of adaptive capital; it enhances leaders' capacity for integrative reasoning, organizational translation, and strategic flexibility in uncertain environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u9886\u5bfc\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u516c\u53f8\u7ee9\u6548\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u5e7f\u5ea6CEO\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u9886\u5bfc\u5e7f\u5ea6\u6216\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8d44\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u804c\u4e1a\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u65e9\u671f\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u60f3\u63a2\u7d22\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u539f\u5219\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ba1\u7ee9\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528650\u4f4dCEO\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u5e7f\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u5e7f\u5ea6CEO\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u4e09\u5e74\u5e73\u5747\u8d85\u540c\u884c9.8\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e7f\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u6bcf\u589e\u52a01\u70b9\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u56de\u62a5\u589e\u52a01.8\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u5bfc\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u516c\u53f8\u7ee9\u6548\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8d44\u672c\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u5bfc\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Doing so delivers superior concurrent performance by freeing up all GPU cores for computation and also lowers interference in the memory sub-system (caches). While DMA collectives show strong promise, prior works have only studied them in limited context (bandwidth-bound transfer sizes only, performance-only).\n  To address this, we provide a comprehensive performance, power/energy and synchronization costs analysis of offloading ML communication collectives (all-gather, all-to-all) to DMA engines on state-of-the-art AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Our analysis reveals that, compared to the state-of-the-art RCCL communication collectives library, DMA collectives are at-par or better for large sizes (10s of MB to GB) in terms of both performance (16% better) and power (32% better). However, they significantly lag for latency-bound small sizes; 4.5X and 2.5X slower for all-gather and all-to-all, respectively. We provide a detailed latency breakdown of a DMA transfer and identify that DMA command scheduling and synchronization costs can limit DMA collective performance. To tackle this, we harness existing DMA architecture innovations, hitherto untapped, to build optimized DMA collectives and demonstrate their efficacy on real hardware. Our optimized implementations considerably close the performance gap for DMA collectives at smaller sizes (30% slower and 20% faster all-gather and all-to-all, respectively) and further improves performance (by 7%) and power savings at larger sizes (3-10%). Overall, this work represents a significant step toward making DMA collectives suitable for adoption in mainstream collective libraries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790AMD Instinct MI300X GPU\u4e0aDMA\u96c6\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u529f\u8017\u7b49\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f29\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76DMA\u96c6\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9AMD Instinct MI300X GPU\u4e0aML\u901a\u4fe1\u96c6\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u529f\u8017\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u6210\u672c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709DMA\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u65f6\uff0cDMA\u96c6\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4RCCL\u597d16%\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u597d32%\uff1b\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u65f6\uff0c\u5168\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5168\u5bf9\u5168\u5206\u522b\u61624.5\u500d\u548c2.5\u500d\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7f29\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63a8\u52a8DMA\u96c6\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u96c6\u4f53\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To do so, they iteratively perform queries to an oracle, each about a chosen vertex $v$.

Additionally, each vertex $v$ may have a different query cost $c(v)$ and a different weight $w(v)$. The goal is to find the optimal querying strategy which minimizes the weighted average-case cost required to find $x$. The problem is NP-hard even for uniform weights and query costs.

In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u89c1\u89e3\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u5728\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba/\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u6536\u76ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u4e2d\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e09\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u6613\u53d7\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6ce2\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We study, for general (possibly non-monotone) valuations, a popular relaxation of equitability known as equitability up to one item (EQ1). An EQ1 allocation may fail to exist even with additive non-monotone valuations; for instance, when there are two agents, one valuing every item positively and the other negatively. This motivates a mild and natural assumption: all agents agree on the sign of their value for the grand bundle. Under this assumption, we prove the existence and provide an efficient algorithm for computing EQ1 allocations for two agents with general valuations. When there are more than two agents, we show the existence and polynomial-time computability of EQ1 allocations for valuation classes beyond additivity and monotonicity, in particular for (1) doubly monotone valuations and (2) submodular (resp. supermodular) valuations where the value for the grand bundle is nonnegative (resp. nonpositive) for all agents. Furthermore, we settle an open question of Bil`o et al. by showing that an EQ1 allocation always exists for nonnegative(resp. nonpositive) valuations, i.e., when every agent values each subset of items nonnegatively (resp. nonpositively). Finally, we complete the picture by showing that for general valuations with more than two agents, EQ1 allocations may not exist even when agents agree on the sign of the grand bundle, and that deciding the existence of an EQ1 allocation is computationally intractable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6982\u5ff5EQ1\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "EQ1\u5206\u914d\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u4f30\u503c\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5982\u4e24\u4e3b\u4f53\u4f30\u503c\u6b63\u8d1f\u76f8\u53cd\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u4f53\u5bf9\u603b\u675f\u4ef7\u503c\u6b63\u8d1f\u8fbe\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u7c7b\u4e0bEQ1\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e24\u4e3b\u4f53\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u4f30\u503c\u4e0bEQ1\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u67d0\u4e9b\u4f30\u503c\u7c7b\u4e0bEQ1\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\uff1b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e00\u822c\u4f30\u503c\u4e0bEQ1\u5206\u914d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u5224\u5b9a\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u60c5\u51b5\u5bf9EQ1\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e00\u822c\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u60c5\u51b5\u8f83\u590d\u6742\u3002"}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, but their effectiveness depends heavily on how they are prompted. Unlike generic code summarization, test-code summarization poses distinct challenges because test methods validate expected behavior through assertions rather than im- plementing functionality. This paper presents a new benchmark of 91 real-world Java test cases paired with developer-written summaries and conducts a controlled ablation study to investigate how test code-related components-such as the method under test (MUT), assertion messages, and assertion semantics-affect the performance of LLM-generated test summaries. We evaluate four code LLMs (Codex, Codestral, DeepSeek, and Qwen-Coder) across seven prompt configurations using n-gram metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR), semantic similarity (BERTScore), and LLM-based evaluation. Results show that prompting with as- sertion semantics improves summary quality by an average of 0.10 points (2.3%) over full MUT context (4.45 vs. 4.35) while requiring fewer input tokens. Codex and Qwen-Coder achieve the highest alignment with human-written summaries, while DeepSeek underperforms despite high lexical overlap.

One of the key problems in this task is the lack of labeled logs. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from mature systems to train an anomaly detection model of a target system based on the idea of transfer learning. However, these works still require a certain number of labeled logs from the target system. In this paper, we take a step forward and study a valuable yet underexplored setting: zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection, that is, no labeled logs are available in the target system. Specifically, we propose ZeroLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that enables cross-system log-based anomaly detection under zero-label conditions. To achieve this, we leverage unsupervised domain adaptation to perform adversarial training between the source and target domains, aiming to learn system-agnostic general feature representations. By employing meta-learning, the learned representations are further generalized to the target system without any target labels. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that ZeroLog reaches over 80% F1-score without labels, comparable to state-of-the-art cross-system methods trained with labeled logs, and outperforms existing methods under zero-label conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faZeroLog\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ecd\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e00\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u5173\u8868\u793a\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5ZeroLog\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5728\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cZeroLog\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u65f6F1\u5206\u6570\u8d8580%\uff0c\u4e0e\u6709\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ZeroLog\u80fd\u5728\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

This nearly matches the quality of the best known polynomial construction of a tree cut-sparsifier, of quality $O(\\log^{1.5} n \\log\\log n)$ [R\u00e4cke and Shah, ESA~2014]. By the flow-cut gap, our result yields a tree flow-sparsifier (and congestion-approximator) of quality $O(\\log^{3} n \\log\\log n)$. This improves on the celebrated result of [R\u00e4cke, Shah, and T\u00e4ubig, SODA~2014] (RST) that gave a near-linear time construction of a tree flow-sparsifier of quality $O(\\log^{4} n)$.\n  Our algorithm builds on a recent \\emph{expander decomposition} algorithm by [Agassy, Dorfman, and Kaplan, ICALP~2023], which we use as a black box to obtain a clean and modular foundation for tree cut-sparsifiers. This yields an improved and simplified version of the RST construction for cut-sparsifiers with quality $O(\\log^{3} n)$. We then introduce a near-linear time \\emph{refinement phase} that controls the load accumulated on boundary edges of the sub-clusters across the levels of the tree.

To address this failing, we introduce a training-free representation sharpening framework that augments a document's representation with information that helps differentiate it from similar documents in the corpus. On over twenty datasets spanning multiple languages, the representation sharpening framework proves consistently superior to traditional retrieval, setting a new state-of-the-art on the BRIGHT benchmark. We show that representation sharpening is compatible with prior approaches to zero-shot dense retrieval and consistently improves their performance.

However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone.

To address these challenges, we propose DAUM, a joint modeling framework that integrates multi-objective learning with uncertainty modeling, yielding both traffic quality predictions and reliable confidence estimates.

The study employs the machinery of asymptotic expansion homogenization to analyze discrete mechanical models with rotational degrees of freedom commonly used to simulate the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous solids. The proposed derivation has general validity in both stationary (steady-state) and transient conditions (assuming wavelength much larger that particle size) and for arbitrary nonlinear, inelastic fine-scale constitutive equations. The results show that the unit cell problem is always stationary, and the only inertia term appears in the linear momentum balance equation at the coarse scale. Depending on the magnitude of the local bending stiffness, mathematical homogenization rigorously identifies two limiting conditions that correspond to the Cauchy continuum and the Cosserat continuum. A heuristic combination of these two limiting conditions provides very accurate results also in the transition from one limiting case to the other.

Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $\u03b3$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$\u03b3$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $\u03b3\\approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Fast - Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH - RL)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u518d\u5165\u589e\u76ca\u03b3\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u03b3\u503c\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u53cd\u5c04\u5e26\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u81ea\u6307\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7eaf\u524d\u9988\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165FH - RL\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6539\u53d8\u518d\u5165\u589e\u76ca\u03b3\uff0c\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u518d\u5165\u6bd4\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u8c31\u9012\u5f52\u6307\u6570\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u518d\u5165\u91cf\u4e0e\u03b3\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u77e9\u9635Wr\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u5728\u9002\u5ea6\u589e\u76ca\u65f6\u66f4\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5728\u03b3\u22480.10 - 0.20\u9644\u8fd1\u51fa\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u53cd\u5c04\u5e26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u9988\u653e\u5927\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u4ee3\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u76ae\u8d28\u518d\u5165\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002"}}

However, the scarcity of labeled logs limits rapid deployment to new systems. Cross-system transfer has become an important research direction. State-of-the-art approaches perform well with a few labeled target logs, but limitations remain: small-model methods transfer general knowledge but overlook mismatches with the target system's proprietary knowledge; LLM-based methods can capture proprietary patterns but rely on a few positive examples and incur high inference cost. Existing LLM-small model collaborations route 'simple logs' to the small model and 'complex logs' to the LLM based on output uncertainty. In zero-label cross-system settings, supervised sample complexity is unavailable, and such routing does not consider knowledge separation. To address this, we propose GeneralLog, a novel LLM-small model collaborative method for zero-label cross-system log anomaly detection. GeneralLog dynamically routes unlabeled logs, letting the LLM handle 'proprietary logs' and the small model 'general logs,' enabling cross-system generalization without labeled target logs.

Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] proved that generation is achievable in surprisingly general settings. But their generator suffers from ``mode collapse,'' producing from an ever-smaller subset of the target. To address this, Kleinberg and Wei [KW25] require the generator's output to be ``dense'' in the target language. They showed that generation with density, surprisingly, remains achievable at the same generality.\n  Both results assume perfect data: no noisy insertions and no omissions. This raises a central question: how much contamination can generation tolerate? Recent works made partial progress on this question by studying (non-dense) generation with either finite amounts of noise (but no omissions) or omissions (but no noise).\n  We characterize robustness under contaminated enumerations: 1. Generation under Contamination: Language generation in the limit is achievable for all countable collections iff the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. When this fails, we characterize which collections are generable. 2. Dense Generation under Contamination: Dense generation is strictly less robust to contamination than generation. As a byproduct, we resolve an open question of Raman and Raman [ICML25] by showing that generation is possible with only membership oracle access under finitely many contaminated examples.\n  Finally, we introduce a beyond-worst-case model inspired by curriculum learning and prove that dense generation is achievable even with infinite contamination provided the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero.

However, limited by computation capacity of CPU device and traditional solvers, conventional iteration methods are inefficient in complicated case with textured surface requiring refined mesh, and could not handle simulation during multiple periods. To accelerate Picard iteration for predicting dynamics of APP, a GPU-boosted high-performance Multi-working condition joint Analysis Framework (GMAF) is designed, which adopts Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG) using Approximate Symmetric Successive Over-Relaxation preconditioner (ASSOR). GMAF abundantly utilizes GPU device via elevating computational intensity and expanding scale of massive parallel computation. Therefore, it possesses novel performance in analyzing dynamics of both smooth and textured APPs during multiple periods, as the establishment and solution to joint algebraic system for pressure field are accelerated magnificently, as well as numerical integral for force and moment due to oil flow. Compared with asynchronized convergence strategy pursuing local convergence, synchronized convergence strategy targeting global convergence is adopted in PCG solver for the joint system.

However, existing methods lack in-depth modeling when dealing with interactions that generate only auxiliary behaviors without triggering the target behavior. In fact, these weak signals contain rich latent information and can be categorized into two types: (1) positive weak signals-items that have not triggered the target behavior but exhibit frequent auxiliary interactions, reflecting users' hesitation tendencies toward these items; and (2) negative weak signals-auxiliary behaviors that result from misoperations or interaction noise, which deviate from true preferences and may cause negative transfer effects. To more effectively identify and utilize these weak signals, we propose a recommendation framework focused on weak signal learning, termed HNT. Specifically, HNT models weak signal features from two dimensions: positive and negative effects. By learning the characteristics of auxiliary behaviors that lead to target behaviors, HNT identifies similar auxiliary behaviors that did not trigger the target behavior and constructs a hesitation set of related items as weak positive samples to enhance preference modeling, thereby capturing users' latent hesitation intentions. Meanwhile, during auxiliary feature fusion, HNT incorporates latent negative transfer effect modeling to distinguish and suppress interference caused by negative representations through item similarity learning.

Deep neural kernels provide a principled framework to interpret over-parameterized neural networks by mapping hierarchical feature transformations into kernel spaces, thereby combining the expressive power of deep architectures with the analytical tractability of kernel methods. Recent advances, particularly neural tangent kernels (NTKs) derived by gradient inner products, have established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and nonparametric Bayesian inference. However, the existing NTK paradigm has been predominantly confined to the infinite-width regime, while overlooking the representational role of network depth. To address this gap, we propose a depth-induced NTK kernel based on a shortcut-related architecture, which converges to a Gaussian process as the network depth approaches infinity. We theoretically analyze the training invariance and spectrum properties of the proposed kernel, which stabilizes the kernel dynamics and mitigates degeneration.

We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $\u03b8$ and $\u03c4$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity. We propose an efficient Normalized Least Squares (NLS) estimator and prove it achieves the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ convergence rate for joint parameter recovery.

By pairing context-free grammars with constraints, users have the expressiveness of unrestricted grammars while retaining simple structure. However, producing inputs in the presence of such constraints can be challenging. In past approaches, SMT solvers have been found to be very slow at finding string solutions; evolutionary algorithms are faster and more general, but current implementations still struggle with complex constraints that would be required for domains such as compiler testing. In this paper, we present a novel approach for evolutionary language-based testing that improves performance by 3-4 orders of magnitude over the current state of the art, reducing hours of generation and constraint solving time to seconds. We accomplish this by (1) carefully transforming grammar definitions into Rust types and trait implementations, ensuring that the compiler may near-maximally optimize arbitrary operations on arbitrary grammars; and (2) using better evolutionary algorithms that improve the ability of language-based testing to solve complex constraint systems. These performance and algorithmic improvements allow our prototype, FANDANGO-RS, to solve constraints that previous strategies simply cannot handle. We demonstrate this by a case study for a C subset, in which FANDANGO-RS is able to generate 401 diverse, complex, and valid test inputs for a C compiler per minute.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53473 - 4\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u53bb\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6162\u3001\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bed\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aRust\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578bFANDANGO - RS\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u4e4b\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728C\u5b50\u96c6\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u6bcf\u5206\u949f\u80fd\u4e3aC\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u751f\u6210401\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

Our analysis captures how an algorithm's empirical beliefs, encoded through historical reward averages, create momentum that resists new evidence after a change. We show how this inertia can be exploited to construct adversarial instances that mislead classical algorithms such as Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, and UCB, causing them to suffer regret that grows linearly with T and with a substantial constant factor, regardless of how their parameters are tuned, even with a single change point.\n  We extend the analysis to algorithms that periodically restart to handle non stationarity and prove that, even then, the worst case regret remains linear in T.

We combine term frequency--inverse document frequency (TF--IDF) analysis of six national AI strategies (NASs), an inventory of 47 publicly disclosed AI initiatives (January 2017--April 2025), paired case studies, the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and the Saudi Data & Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) Academy, and a scenario matrix linking oil-revenue slack (technical capacity) to regulatory coherence (social alignment).

A straightforward and widely studied approach to this problem is the Bottom-Left Heuristic. It consists of iteratively placing each rectangle in the given order at the lowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, at the leftmost of those. Due to its simplicity and good empirical performance, this heuristic is widely used in practical applications. The most efficient implementation of this heuristic was proposed by Chazelle in 1983, requiring $O(n^2)$ time and $O(n)$ space to place $n$ rectangles. However, although Chazelle's original description was largely correct, it omitted several formal details. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a critical flaw in the original runtime analysis, which, in certain cases, results in $\u03a9(n^3)$ running time. Motivated by this finding, this paper provides a rigorous and corrected presentation of the implementation, addressing the imprecise arguments and resolving the identified flaw.

However, if the equation does not meet the user's expectations, there are few options for getting other equation suggestions without intensive work with the system. To fill this gap, we propose Residuals for Equation Discovery (RED), a post-processing method that improves a given equation in a targeted manner, based on its residuals. By parsing the initial equation to a syntax tree, we can use node-based calculation rules to compute the residual for each subequation of the initial equation. It is then possible to use this residual as new target variable in the original data set and generate a new prompt. If, with the new prompt, the equation discovery system suggests a subequation better than the old subequation on a validation set, we replace the latter by the former. RED is usable with any equation discovery system, is fast to calculate, and is easy to extend for new mathematical operations.

PCD are widely applied in advanced manufacturing processes, including additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing. To ensure the consistency of analysis and avoid false alarms, preprocessing steps such as registration and mesh reconstruction are commonly applied prior to monitoring. However, these steps are error-prone, time-consuming and may introduce artifacts, potentially affecting monitoring outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme. Feature learning methods leverage intrinsic geometric properties of the shape, captured via the Laplacian and geodesic distances. In the monitoring scheme, thresholding techniques are used to further select intrinsic features most indicative of potential out-of-control conditions.

Yet, standard macroeconomic indicators average over most of these processes, blurring the spatial and hierarchical heterogeneity driving people's choices and experiences. To address this gap, we introduce here a framework based on the Price equation to decompose aggregate growth exactly into endogenous and selection effects across nested spatial scales. We illustrate this approach with population and income data from the Chicago metropolitan area (2014-2019) and show that both growth rates and spatial selection effects are most intense at local levels, fat-tailed and spatially correlated. We also find that selection, defined as the covariance between prevailing income and relative population change, is concentrated in few spatial units and exhibits scaling behavior when grouped by county. Despite the intensity of local sorting, selection effects largely cancel in the aggregate, implying that fast heterogeneous micro-dynamics can yield deceptively stable macro-trends. By treating local spatial units (neighborhoods) as evolving subpopulations under selection, we demonstrate how methods from complex systems provide new tools to classify residential selection processes, such as abandonment and gentrification, in an urban sociological framework. This approach is general and applies to any other nested economic systems such as networks of production, occupations, or innovation enabling a new mechanistic understanding of compositional change and growth across scales of organization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ePrice\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u89e3\u603b\u4f53\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4ee5\u829d\u52a0\u54e5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u957f\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u5f3a\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u805a\u5408\u65f6\u591a\u62b5\u6d88\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5d4c\u5957\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6307\u6807\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9a71\u52a8\u4eba\u4eec\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u5c42\u6b21\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f25\u8865\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8ePrice\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5957\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u589e\u957f\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u589e\u957f\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5f3a\u70c8\uff0c\u5448\u80a5\u5c3e\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u9009\u62e9\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u6309\u53bf\u5206\u7ec4\u6709\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u5927\u591a\u62b5\u6d88\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4f4f\u5b85\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5d4c\u5957\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6784\u6210\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u589e\u957f\u3002"}}

To overcome these issues, LLMServingSim2.0 adopts trace-driven performance modeling, accompanied by an operator-level latency profiler, enabling the integration of new accelerators with a single command. It further embeds up-to-date serving techniques while exposing flexible interfaces for request routing, cache management, and scheduling policies. In a TPU case study, our profiler requires 18.5x fewer LoC and outperforms the predecessor's hardware-simulator integration, demonstrating LLMServingSim2.0's low-effort hardware extensibility.

While the variant where the paths need to be pairwise vertex-disjoint, which we call PATH PARTITION, is extensively studied, surprisingly little is known about PATH COVER. We start filling this gap by designing a linear-time algorithm for PATH COVER on trees.\n  We show that PATH COVER can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded treewidth using a dynamic programming scheme.

Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems.

These activities, such as air taxis, rely on low-altitude wireless networks, and one key enabling technology is integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, in low-altitude airspace, ISAC is vulnerable to channel-access attacks, thereby degrading performance and threatening safety. To address this, we propose a defense framework based on a Stackelberg game. Specifically, we first model the system under attack, deriving metrics for the communication and the sensing to quantify performance. Then, we formulate the interaction as a three-player game where a malicious attacker acts as the leader, while the legitimate drone and ground base station act as followers. Using a backward induction algorithm, we obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium, allowing the defenders to dynamically adjust their strategies to mitigate the attack.

The framework integrates structured debate, retrieval-augmented method memory, and ensemble-guided evolutionary search, enabling the agents to generate and assess new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base. These results show that collaborative reasoning among AI agents can yield emergent methodological innovation, suggesting a path toward scalable, transparent, and autonomous discovery in scientific computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdAgenticSciML\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8eSciML\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u5e26\u6765\u65b9\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "SciML\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u635f\u5931\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AgenticSciML\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fa9\u8bba\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u6765\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u6bd4\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad8\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e2d\u672a\u660e\u786e\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u65b9\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u900f\u660e\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, researchers and practitioners may have a hard time locating consolidated evidence on this impact, as the available information is scattered in several different publications. Our goal is to aggregate consolidated findings on quality in MDE, facilitating the work of researchers and practitioners in learning about the coverage and main findings of existing work as well as identifying relatively unexplored niches of research that need further attention. We performed a tertiary study on quality in MDE, in order to gain a better understanding of its most prominent findings and existing challenges, as reported in the literature. We identified 22 systematic literature reviews and mapping studies and the most relevant quality attributes addressed by each of those studies, in the context of MDE. Maintainability is clearly the most often studied and reported quality attribute impacted by MDE. Eighty out of 83 research questions in the selected secondary studies have a structure that is more often associated with mapping existing research than with answering more concrete research questions (e.g., comparing two alternative MDE approaches with respect to their impact on a specific quality attribute). We briefly outline the main contributions of each of the selected literature reviews. In the collected studies, we observed a broad coverage of software product quality, although frequently accompanied by notes on how much more empirical research is needed to further validate existing claims.

However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales.

However, FL suffers from significant communication overhead due to the frequent exchange of high-dimensional model updates over constrained networks. In this paper, we present FedSparQ, a lightweight compression framework that dynamically sparsifies the gradient of each client through an adaptive threshold, applies half-precision quantization to retained entries and integrates residuals from error feedback to prevent loss of information. FedSparQ requires no manual tuning of sparsity rates or quantization schedules, adapts seamlessly to both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions, and is agnostic to model architecture. Through extensive empirical evaluation on vision benchmarks under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, we show that FedSparQ substantially reduces communication overhead (reducing by 90% of bytes sent compared to FedAvg) while preserving or improving model accuracy (improving by 6% compared to FedAvg non-compressed solution or to state-of-the-art compression models) and enhancing convergence robustness (by 50%, compared to the other baselines).

Methods: We performed a quasi-experiment comparing the standard i* concrete syntax with an alternative that has an increased semantic transparency. We asked 57 novice participants to perform understanding and reviewing tasks on i* models, and measured their accuracy, speed and ease, using metrics of task success, time and effort, collected with eye-tracking and participants' feedback.\n  Results: We found no evidence of improved accuracy or speed attributable to the alternative concrete syntax.

We introduce a diagnostic that requires no additional training and uses only the forward pass to emit a binary accept or reject signal during agent execution. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention and computes two spectral statistics in early layers, namely the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. We formalize these signals, establish invariances, and provide finite sample estimators with uncertainty quantification. Under a two regime mixture assumption with a monotone likelihood ratio property, we show that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal in the Bayes sense for detecting context inconsistency. Empirically, the high frequency energy ratio exhibits robust bimodality during context verification across multiple model families, which enables gating decisions with overhead below one millisecond on our hardware and configurations.

Lossy compression of gradient data can mitigate this overhead, and error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) is particularly appealing for its fine-grained utility-compression tradeoff. However, existing EBLC methods (e.g., SZ), originally designed for smooth scientific data with strong spatial locality, rely on generic predictors such as Lorenzo and interpolation for entropy reduction to improve compression ratio. Gradient tensors, in contrast, exhibit low smoothness and weak spatial correlation, rendering these predictors ineffective and leading to poor compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose an EBLC framework tailored for FL gradient data to achieve high compression ratios while preserving model accuracy. The core of it is an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels to reduce residual entropy. The predictor is compatible with standard quantizers and entropy coders and comprises (1) a cross-round magnitude predictor based on a normalized exponential moving average, and (2) a sign predictor that leverages gradient oscillation and kernel-level sign consistency. Experiments show that this new EBLC yields up to 1.53x higher compression ratios than SZ3 with lower accuracy loss.

A key step for CTR prediction is to learn accurate user representation to capture their interests. Generally, the interest expressed by a user is time-variant, i.e., a user activates different interests at different time. However, most previous CTR prediction methods overlook the correlation between the activated interest and the occurrence time, resulting in what they actually learn is the mixture of the interests expressed by the user at all time, rather than the real-time interest at the certain prediction time. To capture the correlation between the activated interest and the occurrence time, in this paper we investigate users' interest evolution from the perspective of the whole time line and develop two regular patterns: periodic pattern and time-point pattern. Based on the two patterns, we propose a novel time-aware long- and short-term user interest modeling method to model users' dynamic interests at different time.

We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations.

How to fine-tune GFMs robustly and efficiently to enable trustworthy knowledge transfer across domains and tasks is the major challenge. In this paper, we propose GRAVER, a novel Generative gRAph VocabulariEs for Robust GFM fine-tuning framework that tackles the aforementioned instability via generative augmentations. Specifically, to identify transferable units, we analyze and extract key class-specific subgraph patterns by ego-graph disentanglement and validate their transferability both theoretically and empirically. To enable effective pre-training across diverse domains, we leverage a universal task template based on ego-graph similarity and construct graph vocabularies via graphon-based generative experts. To facilitate robust and efficient prompt fine-tuning, we grave the support samples with in-context vocabularies, where the lightweight MoE-CoE network attentively routes knowledge from source domains.

In this paper, we investigate how to leverage large language models to design a more scalable and efficient SC framework, especially in the case of growing individuals engaged with decision-making processes.

During the feed-forward process of self-attention, GLIM implicitly simulates the typical bi-level optimization process of SC, including both the feature manipulation and decision rule optimization. Without fine-tuning the LLMs, our proposed GLIM enjoys the advantage of cost-effective adaptation in dynamic strategic environments. Theoretically, we prove GLIM can support pre-trained LLMs to adapt to a broad range of strategic manipulations.

Published at ECSA 2025 Tracks and Workshops", "summary": "The global production of electric goods is at an all-time high, causing negative environmental and health impacts as well as a continuing depletion of natural resources. Considering the worsening global climate change, a transition of current industrial processes is necessary to tackle the above-mentioned factors. To address this urgent issue, socio-economic systems like the Circular Economy (CE) provide options to reallocate the use of resources and products on a global scale. Especially in terms of product lifecycle-prolonging, this system provides suitable approaches to alter the current modes of product handling by society and industry alike, based on the condition of the products. Although the importance and benefits of sustainable services enabling these options are widely known, users tend to shy away from using them. One of the reasons is the missing reliability in terms of the knowledge of the costs associated with a particular service. This uncertainty in expected pricing can, therefore, lower the willingness of potential clients. However, not only clients struggle with the boundary conditions of such services. On the part of the potential providers of services, the monetary risk is often caused by the incapability to detect the condition of a product in advance. This can result on the provider side in a severe economic loss if this possibility is not covered by the service price or through the mass of items, which could allow equalization of serval service operations. To address these weak points in current service execution, the authors propose the \\textit{Lifecycle Workbench (LCW)}-ecosystem, which features digital representations to enhance the reliability of service pricing as well as the assessment of the condition of items, assemblies, and parts in the Circular Economy domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5168\u7403\u7535\u5668\u751f\u4ea7\u521b\u65b0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u73af\u5883\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u4f46\u670d\u52a1\u4f7f\u7528\u9047\u963b\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faLCW\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u670d\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u7403\u7535\u5668\u751f\u4ea7\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5de5\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u514b\u670d\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u670d\u52a1\u4f7f\u7528\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLifecycle Workbench (LCW) - \u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u670d\u52a1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u72b6\u51b5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u4e2d\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "LCW\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9886\u57df\u670d\u52a1\u5b9a\u4ef7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u72b6\u51b5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Ideally, one would like to achieve low worst-case bounds on both update time and recourse.\n  One can achieve approximation $(1+\u03b5)\\ln n$ (greedy-based) or $(1+\u03b5)f$ (primal-dual-based) with worst-case update time $O(f\\log n)$ (ignoring $\u03b5$ dependencies). However, despite a large body of work, no algorithm with low update time (even amortized) and nontrivial worst-case recourse is known, even for unweighted instances ($C = 1$)!\n  We remedy this by providing a transformation that, given as a black-box a SC algorithm with approximation $\u03b1$ and update time $T$, returns a set cover algorithm with approximation $(2 + \u03b5)\u03b1$, update time $O(T + \u03b1C)$, and worst-case recourse $O(\u03b1C)$.

While effective, existing autoregressive models face two intrinsic limitations: (1) unidirectional constraints, where causal attention restricts each token to attend only to its predecessors, hindering global semantic modeling; and (2) error accumulation, where the fixed left-to-right generation order causes prediction errors in early tokens to propagate to the predictions of subsequent token. To address these issues, we propose LLaDA-Rec, a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates recommendation as parallel semantic ID generation. By combining bidirectional attention with the adaptive generation order, the approach models inter-item and intra-item dependencies more effectively and alleviates error accumulation. Specifically, our approach comprises three key designs: (1) a parallel tokenization scheme that produces semantic IDs for bidirectional modeling, addressing the mismatch between residual quantization and bidirectional architectures; (2) two masking mechanisms at the user-history and next-item levels to capture both inter-item sequential dependencies and intra-item semantic relationships; and (3) an adapted beam search strategy for adaptive-order discrete diffusion decoding, resolving the incompatibility of standard beam search with diffusion-based generation.

However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $\u03bc$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

Classical formulations of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) assume that the follower's best response (BR) mapping is known to the leader. However, this is not always true in practice. In those cases the leader needs to simultaneously infer this BR function while fulfilling an internal objective. We study a setting in which the leader selects a control strategy that optimizes an objective given an initial belief about the follower's best response. This belief is updated during the finite decision horizon, prompting the leader to reoptimize its control. We characterize the optimality guarantees of the SE solutions under this belief update for both open loop (OL) and feedback (FB) information structures. In particular, we show that it is possible that assuming an incorrect follower BR map obtains a lower cost over the game horizon than knowing the true BR.

In this model, the distance from a target function $f: \\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}$ that is being tested to a function $g$ is defined relative to the number of inputs $x$ for which $f(x)=1$; moreover, testing algorithms in this model have access both to a black-box oracle for $f$ and to independent uniform satisfying assignments of $f$. The motivation for this model is that it provides a natural framework for testing \\emph{sparse} Boolean functions that have few satisfying assignments, analogous to well-studied models for property testing of sparse graphs.\n  The main result of this paper is a lower bound for testing \\emph{halfspaces} (i.e., linear threshold functions) in the relative error model: we show that $\\tilde\u03a9(\\log n)$ oracle calls are required for any relative-error halfspace testing algorithm over the Boolean hypercube $\\{0,1\\}^n$. This stands in sharp contrast both with the constant-query testability (independent of $n$) of halfspaces in the standard model [MORS10], and with the positive results for relative-error testing of many other classes given in [DHLNSY25, CPPS25a, CPPS25b].

Recent advances often integrate frequency-domain modules to compensate for self-attention's low-pass nature by restoring the high-frequency signals critical for personalized recommendations.

Consequently, they overlook cross-session spectral dependencies and fail to enforce alignment between predicted and actual spectral signatures, leaving valuable frequency information under-exploited.

This study explores distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset, using additive Gaussian noise as a lightweight obfuscation technique. We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels. This indicates U-Net++'s enhanced structural fidelity and low perceptual similarity. Meanwhile, our optimized training pipeline reduces training time by over 60% for both models compared to single-GPU training, and outperforms standard DataParallel by over 40%, with only a minor accuracy drop for both models (trading some accuracy for speed). These findings highlight the effectiveness of software-level optimization in distributed learning for medical imaging. This work demonstrates the practical viability of combining architectural design, lightweight obfuscation, and advanced distributed training strategies to accelerate and enhance medical image processing pipelines in real-world clinical and research environments.

Here, we are given as input a design matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ and measurements or labels ${y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ where ${y} = {X} {w}^* + \u03be$, and $\u03be$ is the noise in the measurements. Importantly, we have the additional constraint that the unknown signal vector ${w}^*$ is sparse: it has $k$ non-zero entries where $k$ is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Our goal is to output a prediction vector $\\widehat{w}$ that has small prediction error: $\\frac{1}{N}\\cdot \\|{X} {w}^* - {X} \\widehat{w}\\|^2_2$.\n  Information-theoretically, we know what is best possible in terms of measurements: under most natural noise distributions, we can get prediction error at most $\u03b5$ with roughly $N = O(k \\log d/\u03b5)$ samples. Computationally, this currently needs $d^{\u03a9(k)}$ run-time. Alternately, with $N = O(d)$, we can get polynomial-time.

To address these challenges, we propose Tool4POI, a novel tool-augmented framework that enables LLMs to perform open-set POI recommendation through external retrieval and reasoning.

Existing datasets are either confined to 2D cases, exhibit limited geometric variations, or lack the multi-modal annotations and data structures - shortcomings we address with AutoHood3D. We validate our numerical methodology, establish quantitative baselines across five neural architectures, and demonstrate systematic surrogate errors in displacement and force predictions. These findings motivate the design of novel approaches and multiphysics loss functions that enforce fluid-solid coupling during model training. By providing fully reproducible workflows, AutoHood3D enables physics-aware ML development, accelerates generative-design iteration, and facilitates the creation of new FSI benchmarks.

Given how typical parameterized problems behave on planar graphs and geometric intersection graphs, we would expect that exact algorithms with some form of subexponential dependence on the solution size or the number of terminals exist. Contrary to this expectation, we show that, assuming the Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH), there is no $2^{o(k+t)}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time algorithm even for unit disks or unit squares, that is, there is no FPT algorithm subexponential in the size of the Steiner tree. However, subexponential dependence can appear in a different form: we show that Steiner Tree can be solved in time $n^{O(\\sqrt{t})}$ for many natural classes of objects, including: Disks of arbitrary size. Axis-parallel squares of arbitrary size. Similarly-sized fat polygons.\n  This in particular significantly improves and generalizes two recent results: (1) Steiner Tree on unit disks can be solved in time $n^{\\Oh(\\sqrt{k + t})}$ (Bhore, Carmi, Kolay, and Zehavi, Algorithmica 2023) and (2) Steiner Tree on planar graphs can be solved in time $n^{O(\\sqrt{t})}$ (Marx, Pilipczuk, and Pilipczuk, FOCS 2018). We complement our algorithms with lower bounds that demonstrate that the class of objects cannot be significantly extended, even if we allow the running time to be $n^{o(k+t)/\\log(k+t)}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Click data has been widely used as a low-cost alternative, and with recent advances in large language models (LLMs), LLM-based relevance annotation has emerged as another promising annotation. This paper investigates whether LLM annotations can replace click data for learning to rank (LTR) by conducting a comprehensive comparison across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both a public dataset, TianGong-ST, and an industrial dataset, Baidu-Click, show that click-supervised models perform better on high-frequency queries, while LLM annotation-supervised models are more effective on medium- and low-frequency queries. Further analysis shows that click-supervised models are better at capturing document-level signals such as authority or quality, while LLM annotation-supervised models are more effective at modeling semantic matching between queries and documents and at distinguishing relevant from non-relevant documents. Motivated by these observations, we explore two training strategies -- data scheduling and frequency-aware multi-objective learning -- that integrate both supervision signals. Both approaches enhance ranking performance across queries at all frequency levels, with the latter being more effective.

FiCABU combines (i) Context-Adaptive Unlearning, which begins edits from back-end layers and halts once the target forgetting is reached, with (ii) Balanced Dampening, which scales dampening strength by depth to preserve retain accuracy. These methods are realized in a full RTL design of a RISC-V edge AI processor that integrates two lightweight IPs for Fisher estimation and dampening into a GEMM-centric streaming pipeline, validated on an FPGA prototype and synthesized in 45 nm for power analysis. Across CIFAR-20 and PinsFaceRecognition with ResNet-18 and ViT, FiCABU achieves random-guess forget accuracy while matching the retraining-free Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) baseline on retain accuracy, reducing computation by up to 87.52 percent (ResNet-18) and 71.03 percent (ViT). On the INT8 hardware prototype, FiCABU further improves retain preservation and reduces energy to 6.48 percent (CIFAR-20) and 0.13 percent (PinsFaceRecognition) of the SSD baseline.

Over these 15 years, it has grown from a purely competition-focused site into a broader ecosystem with forums, notebooks, models, datasets, and more. With the release of the Kaggle Meta Code and Kaggle Meta Datasets, we now have a unique opportunity to explore these competitions, technologies, and real-world applications of Machine Learning and AI. And so in this study, we take a closer look at 15 years of data science on Kaggle - through metadata, shared code, community discussions, and the competitions themselves. We explore Kaggle's growth, its impact on the data science community, uncover hidden technological trends, analyze competition winners, how Kagglers approach problems in general, and more. We do this by analyzing millions of kernels and discussion threads to perform both longitudinal trend analysis and standard exploratory data analysis. Our findings show that Kaggle is a steadily growing platform with increasingly diverse use cases, and that Kagglers are quick to adapt to new trends and apply them to real-world challenges, while producing - on average - models with solid generalization capabilities. We also offer a snapshot of the platform as a whole, highlighting its history and technological evolution.

While conventional OAC methods rely on analog amplitude modulation, their performance is often limited by noise sensitivity and hardware constraints, motivating the use of digital modulation schemes. This paper proposes a novel digital modulation framework optimized for computation over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. The design is formulated as an additive mapping problem to determine the optimal constellation that minimizes the mean-squared error (MSE) under a transmit power constraint. We express the optimal constellation design as a system of nonlinear equations and establish the conditions guaranteeing the uniqueness of its solution. In the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal modulation parameters using the generalized Lambert function, providing analytical insight into the system's behavior. Furthermore, we discuss extensions of the framework to higher-dimensional grids corresponding to multiple channel uses, to non-Gaussian noise models, and to computation over real-valued domains via hybrid digital-analog modulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8eAWGN\u4fe1\u9053\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8c03\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u4f18\u661f\u5ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u9ad8SNR\u4e0b\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfOAC\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u62df\u5e45\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u52a0\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u661f\u5ea7\uff0c\u8868\u8fbe\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u89e3\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u5170\u4f2f\u7279\u51fd\u6570\u63a8\u5bfc\u9ad8SNR\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u9ad8SNR\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8c03\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eAWGN\u4fe1\u9053\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8SNR\u4e0b\u6709\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, this approach can introduce errors when source documents contain outdated or contradictory information. This work investigates the performance of five LLMs in generating RAG-based responses to medicine-related queries. Our contributions are three-fold: i) the creation of a benchmark dataset using consumer medicine information documents from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), where headings are repurposed as natural language questions, ii) the retrieval of PubMed abstracts using TGA headings, stratified across multiple publication years, to enable controlled temporal evaluation of outdated evidence, and iii) a comparative analysis of the frequency and impact of outdated or contradictory content on model-generated responses, assessing how LLMs integrate and reconcile temporally inconsistent information. Our findings show that contradictions between highly similar abstracts do, in fact, degrade performance, leading to inconsistencies and reduced factual accuracy in model answers. These results highlight that retrieval similarity alone is insufficient for reliable medical RAG and underscore the need for contradiction-aware filtering strategies to ensure trustworthy responses in high-stakes domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u751f\u6210\u533b\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u67e5\u8be2\u56de\u590d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6458\u8981\u95f4\u77db\u76fe\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u77db\u76fe\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u606f\u9886\u57df\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cRAG\u867d\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u4f46\u6e90\u6587\u6863\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u77db\u76fe\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u836f\u54c1\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40\u6587\u6863\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u4efd\u7684PubMed\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u77db\u76fe\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u590d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6458\u8981\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u533b\u5b66RAG\uff0c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u9700\u77db\u76fe\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u4fdd\u56de\u590d\u53ef\u4fe1\u3002"}}

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger.

Existing recommendation unlearning methods, while capable of removing target data influence, suffer from inefficient unlearning speed and degraded performance, failing to meet real-time unlearning demands. Considering the ranking-oriented nature of recommendation systems, we present unranking, the process of reducing the ranking positions of target items while ensuring the formal guarantees of recommendation unlearning. To achieve efficient unranking, we propose Learning to Fast Unrank in Collaborative Filtering Recommendation (L2UnRank), which operates through three key stages: (a) identifying the influenced scope via interaction-based p-hop propagation, (b) computing structural and semantic influences for entities within this scope, and (c) performing efficient, ranking-aware parameter updates guided by influence information. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate L2UnRank's model-agnostic nature, achieving state-of-the-art unranking effectiveness and maintaining recommendation quality comparable to retraining, while also delivering a 50x speedup over existing methods.

Our method builds upon the recently proposed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCMs) compression scheme. Specifically, DDCM compresses an image by sequentially choosing the diffusion noise vectors from reproducible random codebooks, guiding the denoiser's output to reconstruct the target image. We modify this framework with Turbo-DDCM, which efficiently combines a large number of noise vectors at each denoising step, thereby significantly reducing the number of required denoising operations. This modification is also coupled with an improved encoding protocol. Furthermore, we introduce two flexible variants of Turbo-DDCM, a priority-aware variant that prioritizes user-specified regions and a distortion-controlled variant that compresses an image based on a target PSNR rather than a target BPP.

Most of these are diffusion models with unique computational characteristics, distinct from both traditional small-scale ML models and large language models. They are highly compute-bound and use an iterative denoising process to generate images, leading to very high inference time. This creates significant challenges in designing a high-throughput system. We discovered that a large fraction of prompts can be served using faster, approximated models. However, the approximation setting must be carefully calibrated for each prompt to avoid quality degradation. Designing a high-throughput system that assigns each prompt to the appropriate model and compatible approximation setting remains a challenging problem. We present Argus, a high-throughput T2I inference system that selects the right level of approximation for each prompt to maintain quality while meeting throughput targets on a fixed-size cluster. Argus intelligently switches between different approximation strategies to satisfy both throughput and quality requirements. Overall, Argus achieves 10x fewer latency service-level objective (SLO) violations, 10% higher average quality, and 40% higher throughput compared to baselines on two real-world workload traces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faArgus\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u6821\u51c6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArgus\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u5207\u6362\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0a\uff0cArgus\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u8fdd\u89c4\u51cf\u5c1110\u500d\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad810%\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad840%\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u80fd\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, current understanding of this crucial resource remains limited. Specifically, a quantitative definition of collaborative information is missing, its manifestation within user-item interactions remains unclear, and its impact on recommendation performance is largely unknown. To bridge this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of collaborative information. We begin by clarifying collaborative information in terms of item co-occurrence patterns, identifying its main characteristics, and presenting a quantitative definition. We then estimate the distribution of collaborative information from several aspects, shedding light on how collaborative information is structured in practice. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of collaborative information on the performance of various recommendation algorithms. Finally, we highlight challenges in effectively capturing collaborative information and outlook promising directions for future research.

However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions.

To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators.

These discussions contain proposed solutions-from design changes to code implementations-as well as their evaluations. Locating solution-related content is essential for investigating reopened issues, addressing regressions, reusing solutions, and understanding code change rationale. Manually understanding long discussions to identify such content can be difficult and time-consuming.\n  This paper automates solution identification using language models as supervised classifiers. We investigate three applications-embeddings, prompting, and fine-tuning-across three classifier types: traditional ML models (MLMs), pre-trained language models (PLMs), and large language models (LLMs). Using 356 Mozilla Firefox issues, we created a dataset to train and evaluate six MLMs, four PLMs, and two LLMs across 68 configurations.\n  Results show that MLMs with LLM embeddings outperform TF-IDF features, prompting underperforms, and fine-tuned LLMs achieve the highest performance, with LLAMAft reaching 0.716 F1 score.

However, training such models from scratch is both computationally expensive and yields diminishing returns once convergence is reached. To remedy these challenges, we propose ReFiT, a new framework that integrates Reinforcement learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion-based recommender systems. In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios.

Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety.

We examine why TSFMs often struggle to generalize and highlight spectral shift (a mismatch between the dominant frequency components in downstream tasks and those represented during pretraining) as a key factor.

Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction.

Given that users' complex and intertwined periodic preferences are difficult to disentangle in the time domain, recent research is exploring frequency domain analysis to identify these hidden patterns. However, current frequency-domain-based methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) They primarily employ static filters with fixed characteristics, overlooking the personalized nature of behavioral patterns; (ii) While the global discrete Fourier transform excels at modeling long-range dependencies, it can blur non-stationary signals and short-term fluctuations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called Wavelet Enhanced Adaptive Frequency Filter for Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, it consists of two vital modules: dynamic frequency-domain filtering and wavelet feature enhancement. The former is used to dynamically adjust filtering operations based on behavioral sequences to extract personalized global information, and the latter integrates wavelet transform to reconstruct sequences, enhancing blurred non-stationary signals and short-term fluctuations.

We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels.

Unfortunately, traditional static pointer analysis techniques used to generate application call graphs suffer from imprecision. These techniques are agnostic to the application's architecture and are designed for broad applicability. To mitigate this precision problem, we propose PhaseSeed, a novel technique that improves the accuracy of pointer analysis for split-phase applications, which have distinct initialization and processing phases. PhaseSeed analyzes the initialization phase dynamically, collecting the points-to relationships established at runtime. At the end of the initialization phase, it then seeds this information to a static analysis stage that performs pointer analysis for all code that stays in scope during the processing phase, improving precision. Our observations show that, given the same runtime configuration options, the points-to relationships established during the initialization phase remain constant across multiple runs.

Previous studies have attempted to identify noisy samples through their diverged data patterns, such as higher loss values, and mitigate their influence through sample dropping or reweighting. However, we observed that noisy samples and hard samples display similar patterns, leading to hard-noisy confusion issue. Such confusion is problematic as hard samples are vital for modeling user preferences. To solve this problem, we propose LLMHNI framework, leveraging two auxiliary user-item relevance signals generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to differentiate hard and noisy samples. LLMHNI obtains user-item semantic relevance from LLM-encoded embeddings, which is used in negative sampling to select hard negatives while filtering out noisy false negatives. An objective alignment strategy is proposed to project LLM-encoded embeddings, originally for general language tasks, into a representation space optimized for user-item relevance modeling. LLMHNI also exploits LLM-inferred logical relevance within user-item interactions to identify hard and noisy samples. These LLM-inferred interactions are integrated into the interaction graph and guide denoising with cross-graph contrastive alignment. To eliminate the impact of unreliable interactions induced by LLM hallucination, we propose a graph contrastive learning strategy that aligns representations from randomly edge-dropped views to suppress unreliable edges. Empirical results demonstrate that LLMHNI significantly improves denoising and recommendation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u786c\u6837\u672c\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLLMHNI\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u53f7\u533a\u5206\u4e8c\u8005\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u786c\u6837\u672c\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u4f3c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u5904\u7406\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u786c\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLMHNI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7528\u6237 - \u9879\u76ee\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u533a\u5206\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "LLMHNI\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMHNI\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u786c\u6837\u672c\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network.

The data's adaptivity creates significant challenges for frequentist UQ, yet Bayesian UQ remains the same as if the data were independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), making it an appealing and commonly used approach. Bayesian UQ requires the (correct) specification of a prior distribution while frequentist UQ does not, but for i.i.d. data the celebrated Bernstein-von Mises theorem shows that as the sample size grows, the prior 'washes out' and Bayesian UQ becomes frequentist-valid, implying that the choice of prior need not be a major impediment to Bayesian UQ as it makes no difference asymptotically. This paper for the first time extends the Bernstein-von Mises theorem to adaptively collected data, proving asymptotic equivalence between Bayesian UQ and Wald-type frequentist UQ in this challenging setting. Our result showing this asymptotic agreement does not require the standard stability condition required by works studying validity of Wald-type frequentist UQ; in cases where stability is satisfied, our results combined with these prior studies of frequentist UQ imply frequentist validity of Bayesian UQ. Counterintuitively however, they also provide a negative result that Bayesian UQ is not asymptotically frequentist valid when stability fails, despite the fact that the prior washes out and Bayesian UQ asymptotically matches standard Wald-type frequentist UQ.

While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSSTODE\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u6d77\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5168\u7403\u548c\u533a\u57df\u6d77\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6d77\u6d0b - \u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6d41\u4f53\u4f20\u8f93\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfcODEs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u6d77\u6d0b\u70ed\u6536\u652f\u65b9\u7a0b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u3002", "result": "SSTODE\u5728\u5168\u7403\u548c\u533a\u57dfSST\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u76f4\u89c2\u5c55\u793a\u5e73\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u70ed\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u663c\u591c\u52a0\u70ed - \u51b7\u5374\u5faa\u73af\u5bf9SST\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "SSTODE\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

While transfer learning has been extensively studied in traditional classification, transfer learning in imbalanced classification such as Neyman-Pearson classification has received much less attention. This setting poses unique challenges, as both types of errors must be simultaneously controlled.

We present an end-to-end system that scales long-sequence modeling to 10k-length histories in production. First, we introduce Stacked Target-to-History Cross Attention (STCA), which replaces history self-attention with stacked cross-attention from the target to the history, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length and enabling efficient end-to-end training. Second, we propose Request Level Batching (RLB), a user-centric batching scheme that aggregates multiple targets for the same user/request to share the user-side encoding, substantially lowering sequence-related storage, communication, and compute without changing the learning objective. Third, we design a length-extrapolative training strategy -- train on shorter windows, infer on much longer ones -- so the model generalizes to 10k histories without additional training cost. Across offline and online experiments, we observe predictable, monotonic gains as we scale history length and model capacity, mirroring the scaling law behavior observed in large language models. Deployed at full traffic on Douyin, our system delivers significant improvements on key engagement metrics while meeting production latency, demonstrating a practical path to scaling end-to-end long-sequence recommendation to the 10k regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u523010k\u957f\u5ea6\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u5728\u6296\u97f3\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u63d0\u5347\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u4e0e\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u5728\u4e0d\u8d85\u5ef6\u65f6\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u6781\u957f\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165STCA\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u63d0\u51faRLB\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u957f\u5ea6\u5916\u63a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u5386\u53f2\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u6709\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u5728\u6296\u97f3\u5168\u6d41\u91cf\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u5347\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u4e0e\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6269\u5c55\u523010k\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

Existing methods focus on using accumulated data to support decision making, enhancing the sharing of secondary data while others exclude some critical stakeholders like patient caretakers and administrators thus, leaving an information gap that creates delays and miscommunication during case management. We however notice some similarities between cancer treatment and software engineering information management especially when progress history needs to be maintained (versioning).\n  We analyze the similarities and propose a model for information sharing among cancer care groups using the software engineering principles approach. We model for reducing delays and improving coordination among care groups in cancer case management.

Any-Logic simulation software was used to mimic the model realism in a virtual environment.

Existing methods typically presuppose perfect priors or can only handle specific, pre-identified error types. And their performance degrades substantially when confronted with flawed constraints of unknown location and type. This decline arises because most of them rely on inflexible and biased thresholding strategies that may conflict with the data distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives. Our proposed method is robust to both linear and nonlinear settings.

Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u56de\u58f0\u53cd\u601d\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAEPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u53cd\u601d\u9636\u6bb5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53cd\u601d\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "AEPO\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "AEPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks for LLM-based code review face three major limitations.

(2) Data quality issues: without rigorous validation, many samples are noisy-e.g., reviews on outdated or irrelevant code-reducing evaluation reliability. (3) Coarse granularity: most benchmarks operate at the file or commit level, overlooking the fine-grained, line-level reasoning essential for precise review.\n  We introduce ContextCRBench, a high-quality, context-rich benchmark for fine-grained LLM evaluation in code review. Our construction pipeline comprises: (1) Raw Data Crawling, collecting 153.7K issues and pull requests from top-tier repositories; (2) Comprehensive Context Extraction, linking issue-PR pairs for textual context and extracting the full surrounding function or class for code context; and (3) Multi-stage Data Filtering, combining rule-based and LLM-based validation to remove outdated, malformed, or low-value samples, resulting in 67,910 context-enriched entries.\n  ContextCRBench supports three evaluation scenarios aligned with the review workflow: (1) hunk-level quality assessment, (2) line-level defect localization, and (3) line-level comment generation. Evaluating eight leading LLMs (four closed-source and four open-source) reveals that textual context yields greater performance gains than code context alone, while current LLMs remain far from human-level review ability.

Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DRRL) addresses this by optimizing for worst-case performance within an uncertainty set defined by a robustness budget $\u03b5$. However, fixing $\u03b5$ results in a tradeoff between performance and robustness: small values yield high nominal performance but weak robustness, while large values can result in instability and overly conservative policies. We propose Distributionally Robust Self-Paced Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (DR-SPCRL), a method that overcomes this limitation by treating $\u03b5$ as a continuous curriculum. DR-SPCRL adaptively schedules the robustness budget according to the agent's progress, enabling a balance between nominal and robust performance.

Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faiTimER\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff08ISTS\uff09\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ISTS\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faiTimER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff0c\u7528Wasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u4f2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0ciTimER\u5728ISTS\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "iTimER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684ISTS\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Findings are mixed. Many charts fail basic discoverability or depend on hover, which blocks keyboard and screen reader use. Plain language summaries are common in CDC and Chicago, but rare in HUD and Houston. Machine readable data is strong for NYC, California, and HUD; it is weaker or unclear for Houston. Several sites promise service for the public or for customers yet do not name accessibility in their descriptions.

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

One of the key problems in this task is the lack of sufficient labeled logs, which limits the rapid deployment in new systems. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from a mature web system and a small amount of labeled logs from a new system, using transfer learning to extract and generalize general knowledge across both domains. However, these methods focus solely on the transfer of general knowledge and neglect the disparity and potential mismatch between such knowledge and the proprietary knowledge of target system, thus constraining performance. To address this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of general and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without any labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router based on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs into 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs a small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct training and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between the source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative knowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small model (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to the target system. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that FusionLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art cross-system log-based anomaly detection methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFusionLog\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5212\u5206\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8cF1\u5206\u6570\u8d8590%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u6807\u6ce8\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5212\u5206\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u5173\u8868\u793a\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e13\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u8f6e\u534f\u4f5c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5fae\u8c03\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFusionLog\u5728\u5168\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0bF1\u5206\u6570\u8d8590%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FusionLog\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u901a\u7528\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u76ee\u6807\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape.

However, many leading Graph Neural Network (GNN) models often neglect the valuable semantic information aggregated at the class level. To address this limitation, this paper introduces CGLE (Class-label Graph Link Estimator), a novel framework designed to augment GNN-based link prediction models. CGLE operates by constructing a class-conditioned link probability matrix, where each entry represents the probability of a link forming between two node classes. This matrix is derived from either available ground-truth labels or from pseudo-labels obtained through clustering. The resulting class-based prior is then concatenated with the structural link embedding from a backbone GNN, and the combined representation is processed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the final prediction. Crucially, CGLE's logic is encapsulated in an efficient preprocessing stage, leaving the computational complexity of the underlying GNN model unaffected. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a broad suite of benchmark datasets, covering both homophilous and sparse heterophilous graphs. The results show that CGLE yields substantial performance gains over strong baselines such as NCN and NCNC, with improvements in HR@100 of over 10 percentage points on homophilous datasets like Pubmed and DBLP. On sparse heterophilous graphs, CGLE delivers an MRR improvement of over 4% on the Chameleon dataset.

However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies.

We aim to address this by developing a fully open-source model, publicly releasing its weights and detailed ablation studies, and planning to share the curated training datasets. Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups. This state-of-the-art performance is driven by a novel data mix of 16.1 million query-document pairs, split between 7.7 million samples from public datasets and 8.4 million synthetically generated examples from various open-weight LLMs. One of our key contributions is a detailed ablation study analyzing core design choices, including a comparison of contrastive loss implementations, an evaluation of synthetic data generation (SDG) strategies, and the impact of model merging.

This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds.

ArchCraft introduces a structured workflow, which uses formal graphs to capture the Architectural Blueprint and symbols to define the Functional Specification, translating unstructured academic papers into verifiable, hardware-aware designs. The framework then generates RTL and testbench (TB) code decoupled via these symbols to facilitate verification and debugging, ultimately reporting the circuit's Power, Area, and Performance (PPA). Moreover, we propose the first benchmark, \\textbf{ArchSynthBench}, for synthesizing hardware from architectural descriptions, with a complete set of evaluation indicators, 50 project-level circuits, and around 600 circuit blocks. We systematically assess ArchCraft on ArchSynthBench, where the experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, surpassing direct generation methods and the VerilogCoder framework in both paper understanding and code completion.

Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines.

NMF is a difficult problem in general (NP-hard), and its solutions are typically not unique. To address these two issues, additional constraints or assumptions are often used. In particular, separability assumes that the basis vectors in the NMF are equal to some columns of the input matrix. In that case, the problem is referred to as separable NMF (SNMF) and can be solved in polynomial-time with robustness guarantees, while identifying a unique solution. However, in real-world scenarios, due to noise or variability, multiple data points may lie near the basis vectors, which SNMF does not leverage. In this work, we rely on the smooth separability assumption, which assumes that each basis vector is close to multiple data points. We explore the properties of the corresponding problem, referred to as smooth SNMF (SSNMF), and examine how it relates to SNMF and orthogonal NMF. We then propose a convex model for SSNMF and show that it provably recovers the sought-after factors, even in the presence of noise. We finally adapt an existing fast gradient method to solve this convex model for SSNMF, and show that it compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and hyperspectral datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\u53ef\u5206\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u53ef\u5206\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\uff08SSNMF\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u51f8\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u5206\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\uff08SNMF\uff09\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9760\u8fd1\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f15\u5165\u5e73\u6ed1\u53ef\u5206\u5047\u8bbe\u7814\u7a76SSNMF\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSSNMF\u7684\u51f8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u51f8\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u6240\u9700\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\u53ef\u5206\u5047\u8bbe\u7684SSNMF\u51f8\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5feb\u901f\u68af\u5ea6\u6c42\u89e3\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u589e\u5f3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u3001Skipper\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u6548\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7ed9\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u589e\u5f3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1Skipper\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u5916\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1bSkipper\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7ec4\u5408\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u4f7f\u5404\u7c7b\u89c4\u5212\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u671d\u7740\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u5411\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

The central innovation of QiVC lies in its quantum-inspired rotated ensemble (QiRE) mechanism. QiRE performs differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogously to quantum state evolution. This approach enables structured uncertainty modeling while preserving the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, resulting in more expressive, stable, and uncertainty-aware representations. To demonstrate its practical potential, the concept is instantiated in a QiVC-based convolutional network (QiVC-Net) and evaluated in the context of biosignal classification, focusing on phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings, a challenging domain characterized by high noise, inter-subject variability, and often imbalanced data. The proposed QiVC-Net integrates an architecture in which the QiVC layer does not introduce additional parameters, instead performing an ensemble rotation of the convolutional weights through a structured mechanism ensuring robustness without added highly computational burden. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, PhysioNet CinC 2016 and PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope 2022, show that QiVC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching accuracies of 97.84% and 97.89%, respectively.

The goal of this paper is to identify opportunities to offload more than one tax component together.

Most privacy analyses provide privacy bounds specifying a noise level sufficient to achieve a target privacy guarantee. Sometimes, these bounds are pessimistic and suggest adding excessive noise, which overwhelms the meaningful signal. It remains unclear if such high noise levels are truly necessary or a limitation of the proof techniques. This paper explores whether we can obtain sharp privacy characterizations that identify the smallest noise level required to achieve a target privacy level for a given mechanism. We study this problem in the context of differentially private principal component analysis, where the goal is to privatize the leading principal components (PCs) of a dataset with n samples and p features. We analyze the exponential mechanism for this problem in a model-free setting and provide sharp utility and privacy characterizations in the high-dimensional limit ($p\\rightarrow\\infty$). Our privacy result shows that, in high dimensions, detecting the presence of a target individual in the dataset using the privatized PCs is exactly as hard as distinguishing two Gaussians with slightly different means, where the mean difference depends on certain spectral properties of the dataset.

PartiBandits is essentially a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it learns a partition of the unlabeled data that shrinks the average conditional variance of $Y$. In the second stage it uses a UCB-style subroutine (\"WarmStart-UCB\") to request labels from each stratum round-by-round. Both the main algorithm's and the subroutine's convergence rates are minimax optimal in classical settings. PartiBandits bridges the UCB and disagreement-based approaches to active learning despite these two approaches being designed to tackle very different tasks.

In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \\textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling. Experiments demonstrate a 24\\% lower reconstruction error and a 99\\% reduction in feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods. This work bridges the interpretability-efficiency gap in LLM analysis, allowing transparent model inspection without compromising computational feasibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51faMoE - SAE\u4e13\u5bb6\u96be\u4ee5\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7f29\u653e\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u964d\u4f4e\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u867d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff08\u540c\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8bed\u4e49\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b50\u96c6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff09\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7f29\u653e\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u9891\u7f29\u653e\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709MoE - SAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e24%\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u51cf\u5c1199%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u900f\u660e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u3002"}}

Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks.

In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on synthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for transformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive self-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem lengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that constant-depth transformers provably learn $\\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\\mathsf{TC}^0$, unless the widely held conjecture $\\mathsf{TC}^0 \\neq \\mathsf{NC}^1$ fails. Finally, we present a broad set of experiments supporting our theoretical results, confirming the length generalization behaviors and the mechanism of attention concentration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This unified representation is directly used to generate structured linguistic descriptions of the visual scene, bridging perception and language within a shared neural substrate. Moreover, unlike the prevalent ``pretrain-then-finetune'' paradigm, SRNN adopts a ``predefine-then-finetune'' approach. On the CLEVRER benchmark, SRNN achieves competitive performance.

Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization.

To verify the effectiveness of \\method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models.

In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity.

Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS.

We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified.

In this setting, a learner repeatedly selects arms and observes reward vectors, aiming to maximize the reward for the highest-priority objective, then the next, and so on. While previous studies have primarily focused on regret minimization, this work bridges the gap between \\textit{regret minimization} and \\textit{best arm identification} under lexicographic preferences. We propose two elimination-based algorithms to address this joint objective. The first algorithm eliminates suboptimal arms sequentially, layer by layer, in accordance with the objective priorities, and achieves sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to those of the best single-objective algorithms. The second algorithm simultaneously leverages reward information from all objectives in each round, effectively exploiting cross-objective dependencies.

Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait\", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention.

To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks.

However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from na\u00efvely aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings. Our contribution represents a meaningful step towards more efficient model evaluation in real-world contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08RCT\uff09\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51faNPW\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728AI\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e72\u9884\u4f1a\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff0cRCT\u867d\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u504f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u91cf\u5316\u76f4\u63a5\u805a\u5408\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u548c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u6027\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faNPW\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cNPW\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u671d\u7740\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it.

However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMOSS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u4e24\u9879\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dFP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMOSS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u4e24\u7ea7\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u81ea\u52a8\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "result": "MOSS\u5b9e\u73b07B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548FP8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eBF16\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534734%\u3002", "conclusion": "MOSS\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u786e\u4fddFP8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose LFU caching optimization based on our analysis and obtain strong improvements from LRU. 3. We implement and experiment speculative expert pre-fetching, providing detailed trace showing its huge potential . 4.

Combining definition, lifecycle processes, hardware strategies, and calibrated measurement, this article offers actionable, evidence based guidance for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u9488\u5bf9AI\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u591a\u7ef4\u8d1f\u62c5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7eff\u8272AI\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u5de5\u5177\u5728AI\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8d1f\u62c5\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u7ef4\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7eff\u8272AI\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5c06\u4e94\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e0eLCA\u9636\u6bb5\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PDCA\u5faa\u73af\u8fdb\u884c\u6cbb\u7406\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e91\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6821\u51c6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u6db5\u76d6\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u3001\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\\mathcal{EL}_\\bot$ and $\\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\\text{DL-Lite}^\\mathcal{H}_\\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\\mathsf{TC}_0$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u52a0\u6743\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aTC\u2080\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9aDL\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5e0c\u671b\u7814\u7a76\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7cbe\u786e\u6307\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DL - Lite\u1d34\u2098\u2092\u2092\u2097\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0b\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aTC\u2080\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u52a0\u6743\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6709\u65b0\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\\%.

Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines.

To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning.

Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features.

While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series.

Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems.

Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes.

Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence.

Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMENTOR\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53d1\u5e039000\u4e2a\u98ce\u9669\u67e5\u8be2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8865\u5145\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u9632\u5fa1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u5951\u5408\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "MENTOR\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an H\u00e1jek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5408\u4f5c\u505a\u5e02\u6846\u67b6CMM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u505a\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u505a\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u4e14\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8367\u5149\u63a2\u9488\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u63d0\u51faCMM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5c42\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8ba9\u591a\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u5f15\u5165H\u00e1jek - MoE\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCMM\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u505a\u5e02\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "CMM\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u505a\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u6162\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Current physics-based models require extensive calibration and computational resources that preclude real-time implementation, while purely data-driven approaches fail to extrapolate beyond training conditions-critical for dynamic electrolyzer operation. Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85\u00b0C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations.

Framing the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, we develop a permutation- and affine-equivariant transformer that estimates both the probability density $f(x)$ and its score $\\nabla_x \\log f(x)$ directly from i.i.d. samples. Unlike traditional score-matching methods that require training a separate model for each distribution, our approach learns a single distribution-agnostic operator that generalizes across densities and sample sizes. The architecture employs cross-attention to connect observed samples with arbitrary query points, enabling generalization beyond the training data, while built-in symmetry constraints ensure equivariance to permutation and affine transformations. Analytically, we show that the attention weights can recover classical kernel density estimation (KDE), and verify it empirically, establishing a principled link between classical KDE and the transformer architecture. Empirically, the model achieves substantially lower error and better scaling than KDE and score-debiased KDE (SD-KDE), while exhibiting better runtime scaling.

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully leveraged to enhance Agent-Based Modeling and simulate human-like social behavior with unprecedented degree of believability.

The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process.

Consequently, they lack an inherent incentive to compress history into compact latent states with consistent transition rules. This often leads to learning solutions that generalize poorly. We introduce Next-Latent Prediction (NextLat), which extends standard next-token training with self-supervised predictions in the latent space. Specifically, NextLat trains a transformer to learn latent representations that are predictive of its next latent state given the next output token. Theoretically, we show that these latents provably converge to belief states, compressed information of the history necessary to predict the future. This simple auxiliary objective also injects a recurrent inductive bias into transformers, while leaving their architecture, parallel training, and inference unchanged. NextLat effectively encourages the transformer to form compact internal world models with its own belief states and transition dynamics -- a crucial property absent in standard next-token prediction transformers. Empirically, across benchmarks targeting core sequence modeling competencies -- world modeling, reasoning, planning, and language modeling -- NextLat demonstrates significant gains over standard next-token training in downstream accuracy, representation compression, and lookahead planning.

Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization.

While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention.

We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks.

We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens.

While existing bendable RISC-V systems provide compact solutions, they lack the energy efficiency required. We present a mechanically flexible RISC-V that integrates a bespoke multiply-accumulate co-processor with fixed coefficients to maximize energy efficiency and minimize latency. Our approach formulates a constrained programming problem to jointly determine co-processor constants and optimally map Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) inference operations, enabling compact, model-specific hardware by leveraging the low fabrication and non-recurring engineering costs of flexible technologies. Post-layout results demonstrate near-real-time performance across several healthcare datasets, with our circuits operating within the power budget of existing flexible batteries and occupying only 2.42 mm^2, offering a promising path toward accessible, sustainable, and conformable healthcare wearables.

In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment.

RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict.

Accepted ICDM 2025 (IEEE International Conference on Data Mining)", "summary": "Modern recommender systems face a critical challenge in complying with privacy regulations like the 'right to be forgotten': removing a user's data without disrupting recommendations for others. Traditional unlearning methods address this by partial model updates, but introduce propagation bias--where unlearning one user's data distorts recommendations for behaviorally similar users, degrading system accuracy. While retraining eliminates bias, it is computationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. To address this challenge, we propose CRAGRU, a novel framework leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for efficient, user-specific unlearning that mitigates bias while preserving recommendation quality. CRAGRU decouples unlearning into distinct retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, we employ three tailored strategies designed to precisely isolate the target user's data influence, minimizing collateral impact on unrelated users and enhancing unlearning efficiency. Subsequently, the generation stage utilizes an LLM, augmented with user profiles integrated into prompts, to reconstruct accurate and personalized recommendations without needing to retrain the entire base model. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that CRAGRU effectively unlearns targeted user data, significantly mitigating unlearning bias by preventing adverse impacts on non-target users, while maintaining recommendation performance comparable to fully trained original models.

However, most existing MTPP models rely on channel-mixing strategies that encode information from different event types into a single, fixed-size latent representation. This entanglement can obscure type-specific dynamics, leading to performance degradation and increased risk of overfitting. In this work, we introduce ITPP, a novel channel-independent architecture for MTPP modeling that decouples event type information using an encoder-decoder framework with an ODE-based backbone. Central to ITPP is a type-aware inverted self-attention mechanism, designed to explicitly model inter-channel correlations among heterogeneous event types.

It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics.

In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on tabular data, which is particularly challenging due to the presence of both numerical and categorical features. Our key idea is a novel technique to convert categorical values into floating-point representations. This approach preserves enough information to maintain clean-model accuracy compared to traditional methods like one-hot or ordinal encoding. By doing this, we create a gradient-based universal perturbation that applies to all features, including categorical ones.\n  We evaluate our method on five datasets and four popular models. Our results show up to a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box settings (including real-world applications like Vertex AI), revealing a severe vulnerability for tabular data.

Using the Qwen-2.5 model family across prompts ranging from a few hundred to 100,000 tokens, we measure time-to-first-token (TTFT), steady-state throughput, latency percentiles, long-context behavior (key-value and prompt caching), quantization support, streaming performance, batching and concurrency behavior, and deployment complexity.\n  Under our settings, MLX achieves the highest sustained generation throughput, while MLC-LLM delivers consistently lower TTFT for moderate prompt sizes and offers stronger out-of-the-box inference features. llama.cpp is highly efficient for lightweight single-stream use, Ollama emphasizes developer ergonomics but lags in throughput and TTFT, and PyTorch MPS remains limited by memory constraints on large models and long contexts.\n  All frameworks execute fully on-device with no telemetry, ensuring strong privacy guarantees. We release scripts, logs, and plots to reproduce all results. Our analysis clarifies the design trade-offs in Apple-centric LLM deployments and provides evidence-based recommendations for interactive and long-context processing.

TV DTF estimates the directional information flow between brain regions across distinct EEG frequency bands, thereby capturing temporal and causal influences that are often overlooked by static functional connectivity measures. EEG recordings from the 32 channel SAM 40 dataset were employed, focusing on mental arithmetic task trials. The dynamic EEG-based TV-DTF features were validated through ML classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Experimental results show that alpha-TV-DTF provided the strongest discriminative power, with SVM achieving 89.73% accuracy in 3-class classification and with XGBoost achieving 93.69% accuracy in 2 class classification. Relative to absolute power and phase locking based functional connectivity features, alpha TV DTF and beta TV DTF achieved higher performance across the ML models, highlighting the advantages of dynamic over static measures.

Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment.

In this work, we introduce a novel hierarchical autoregressive framework for modeling protein dynamics that leverages the intrinsic multi-scale organization of molecular motions. Unlike existing methods that focus on generating static conformational ensembles or treat dynamic sampling as an independent process, our approach characterizes protein dynamics as a Markovian process. The framework employs a two-scale architecture: a low-resolution model captures slow, collective motions driving major conformational transitions, while a high-resolution model generates detailed local fluctuations conditioned on these large-scale movements. This hierarchical design ensures that the causal dependencies inherent in protein dynamics are preserved, enabling the generation of temporally coherent and physically realistic trajectories.

A popular solution is sub-model training, where the server only distributes randomly sampled sub-models to the edge clients, and clients only update these small models. However, those random sampling of sub-models may not give satisfying convergence performance. In this paper, observing the success of SGD with shuffling, we propose a distributed shuffled sub-model training, where the full model is partitioned into several sub-models in advance, and the server shuffles those sub-models, sends each of them to clients at each round, and by the end of local updating period, clients send back the updated sub-models, and server averages them.

We first introduce an 11-layer failure stack, a structured framework for identifying vulnerabilities ranging from hardware and power foundations to adaptive learning and agentic reasoning. Building on this, the chapter demonstrates how failures rarely occur in isolation but propagate across layers, creating cascading effects with systemic consequences. To complement this diagnostic lens, we develop the concept of awareness mapping: a maturity-oriented framework that quantifies how well individuals and organizations recognize reliability risks across the AI stack. Awareness is treated not only as a diagnostic score but also as a strategic input for AI governance, guiding improvement and resilience planning.

Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between entities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for understanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversarial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computationally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases.

Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment.

Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state.

The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples.

In this paper, we propose AIRMap, a deep-learning framework for ultra-fast radio-map estimation, along with an automated pipeline for creating the largest radio-map dataset to date. AIRMap uses a single-input U-Net autoencoder that processes only a 2D elevation map of terrain and building heights. Trained and evaluated on 60,000 Boston-area samples, spanning coverage areas from 500 m to 3 km per side, AIRMap predicts path gain with under 5 dB RMSE in 4 ms per inference on an NVIDIA L40S -over 7000x faster than GPU-accelerated ray tracing based radio maps. A lightweight transfer learning calibration using just 20% of field measurements reduces the median error to approximately 10%, significantly outperforming traditional simulators, which exceed 50% error.

Prior work has established that $O(d \\log n)$ samples are sufficient for this task. However, an important factor that is often overlooked in these analyses is the dependence on the condition number of the covariance matrix of the model. Indeed, all algorithms from prior work require a number of samples that grows polynomially with this condition number. In many cases this is unsatisfactory, since the condition number could grow polynomially with $n$, rendering these prior approaches impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we provide an algorithm that recovers the underlying graph and prove that the number of samples required is independent of the condition number. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds that nearly match the upper bound up to a $d$-factor, thus providing an almost tight characterization of the true sample complexity of the problem.

Existing methods proposed to handle noisy clients assume that a sufficient number of clients with clean labels are available, which can be leveraged to learn a robust global model while dampening the impact of noisy clients. This assumption fails when a high number of heterogeneous clients contain noisy labels, making the existing approaches ineffective. In such scenarios, it is important to locally regularize the clients before communication with the global model, to ensure the global model isn't corrupted by noisy clients. While pre-trained self-supervised models can be effective for local regularization, existing centralized approaches relying on pretrained initialization are impractical in a federated setting due to the potentially large size of these models, which increases communication costs. In that line, we propose a regularization objective for client models that decouples the pre-trained and classification models by enforcing similarity between close data points within the client.

Early identification is essential to reduce irreversible vision loss, yet current diagnostic workflows rely on methods such as fundus photography and expert review, which remain costly and resource-intensive. This, combined with DR's asymptomatic nature, results in its underdiagnosis rate of approximately 25 percent. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, limited interpretability and the absence of uncertainty quantification restrict clinical reliability. Therefore, in this study, a deep ensemble learning framework integrated with uncertainty estimation is introduced to improve robustness, transparency, and scalability in DR detection. The ensemble incorporates seven CNN architectures-ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), and EfficientNet (B0, B2, B3)- whose outputs are fused through an accuracy-weighted majority voting strategy. A probability-weighted entropy metric quantifies prediction uncertainty, enabling low-confidence samples to be excluded or flagged for additional review. Training and validation on 35,000 EyePACS retinal fundus images produced an unfiltered accuracy of 93.70 percent (F1 = 0.9376). Uncertainty-filtering later was conducted to remove unconfident samples, resulting in maximum-accuracy of 99.44 percent (F1 = 0.9932).

Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions.

Both models were trained on data derived from a comprehensive review of parabolic flight literature, using published findings as anchor points to construct robust, continuous functions. To complement this quantitative analysis, we simulated subjective human experience under different gravitational loads, ranging from microgravity (0g) and partial gravity (Moon 0.17g, Mars 0.38g) to hypergravity associated with spacecraft launch and re-entry (1.8g), using a large language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet).

While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faT - SAEs\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982SAEs\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e30\u5bcc\u6982\u5ff5\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u504f\u5411\u6d45\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T - SAEs)\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u76f8\u90bb\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cT - SAEs\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "T - SAEs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline.

With the growing excitement around using AI agents to automate important scientific tasks, we explore whether current AI systems can perform multiple tasks necessary for data proofreading. We introduce ConnectomeBench, a multimodal benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) capabilities in three critical proofreading tasks: segment type identification, split error correction, and merge error detection. Using expert annotated data from two large open-source datasets - a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex and the complete Drosophila brain - we evaluate proprietary multimodal LLMs including Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, as well as open source models like InternVL-3 and NVLM. Our results demonstrate that current models achieve surprisingly high performance in segment identification (52-82% balanced accuracy vs. 20-25% chance) and binary/multiple choice split error correction (75-85% accuracy vs. 50% chance) while generally struggling on merge error identification tasks. Overall, while the best models still lag behind expert performance, they demonstrate promising capabilities that could eventually enable them to augment and potentially replace human proofreading in connectomics.

Results demonstrate that classical ensemble methods substantially outperform deep learning on small physiological datasets, with ExtraTrees achieving F1 = 0.826 on combined features and F1 = 0.623 on wrist-only features, compared to transformers achieving only F1 = 0.509-0.577.

Furthermore, ONNX optimization yields a 30.5% average storage reduction and 40.1x inference speedup, highlighting the feasibility of privacy-preserving on-device emotion recognition for real-world wearables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u8155PPG\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\uff0c\u7ecfONNX\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5c0f\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e91\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5728WESAD\u538b\u529b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ecf\u5178\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cTransformer\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u5178\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cExtraTrees\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u7ecfONNX\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u79ef\u5c0f\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f4e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002"}}

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \\textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets.

For generation, we directly learn the joint distribution of discrete images for one-step visual synthesis, enabling coordinated language-visual modeling through learnable cross-modal attention mechanisms. \\textbf{2) Dynamic Perception Pretraining}: We propose a bidirectional dynamic alignment strategy employing inverse dynamics tasks and forward dynamics tasks, effectively strengthening multimodal correlations within a unified feature space. \\textbf{3) Reinforced Supervised Fine-Tuning}: While conducting instruction-based fine-tuning in the unified generation space, we construct a reinforce loss to align the spatial logic between textual actions and generated images, enabling the model to acquire spatio-awared multimodal planning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEVLP\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5177\u8eab\u957f\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u672a\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5177\u8eab\u957f\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6267\u884c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEVLP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality.

Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency.

For efficient deployment of these algorithms, although different techniques for the compression of neural network models are proposed, neural pruning is one of the fastest and effective methods, which can provide a high compression gain with minimal cost. To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Herein, we introduce CAMP-HiVe, a cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian Vector approximation by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, combining significant and less significant weights, thus effectively streamlining the model while preserving its performance. This dynamic, adaptive framework allows for real-time adjustment of weight significance, ensuring that only the most critical parameters are retained. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant reductions in computational requirements while maintaining high performance across different neural network architectures, e.g., ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2, on standard benchmark datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art neural pruning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eHessian - vector products\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5CAMP - HiVe\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u591a\u8fd0\u884c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Hessian - vector products\u8fd1\u4f3c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e42\u8fed\u4ee3\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u63d0\u51faCAMP - HiVe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u5e76\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u7cbe\u7b80\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff08ResNet18\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08CIFAR10\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops.

To address this need, Online Continual Learning (OCL) mechanisms have been proposed, allowing models to update their knowledge incrementally as new data become available while preserving previously acquired information. However, existing OCL approaches for sensor-based HAR are computationally intensive and require extensive labeled samples to represent new changes. Recently, pre-trained model-based (PTM-based) OCL approaches have shown significant improvements in performance and efficiency for computer vision applications. These methods achieve strong generalization capabilities by pre-training complex models on large datasets, followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks for continual learning. However, applying PTM-based OCL approaches to sensor-based HAR poses significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of HAR datasets and the scarcity of labeled data in post-deployment scenarios. This paper introduces PTRN-HAR, the first successful application of PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR. Unlike prior PTM-based OCL approaches, PTRN-HAR pre-trains the feature extractor using contrastive loss with a limited amount of data. This extractor is then frozen during the streaming stage. Furthermore, it replaces the conventional dense classification layer with a relation module network. Our design not only significantly reduces the resource consumption required for model training while maintaining high performance, but also improves data efficiency by reducing the amount of labeled data needed for effective continual learning, as demonstrated through experiments on three public datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

Most current research has focused on reducing the quadratic complexity of attention to address the resulting low training and inference efficiency.

Physics-Attention projects grid points into slices for slice attention, then maps them back through deslicing. However, we observe that Physics-Attention can be reformulated as a special case of linear attention, and that the slice attention may even hurt the model performance. Based on these observations, we argue that its effectiveness primarily arises from the slice and deslice operations rather than interactions between slices.

However, current ST platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a challenge to model the interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images. Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over competing methods. Moreover, we evaluate C3-Diff on downstream tasks of cell type localization, gene expression correlation and single-cell-level gene expression prediction, promoting AI-enhanced biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications.

The growing availability of 3D geospatial data from multiple modalities has introduced new opportunities and challenges for integrating spatial knowledge at scale, particularly in high-impact domains such as urban planning and rapid disaster management. Geospatial entity resolution is the task of identifying matching spatial objects across different datasets, often collected independently under varying conditions. Existing approaches typically rely on spatial proximity, textual metadata, or external identifiers to determine correspondence. While useful, these signals are often unavailable, unreliable, or misaligned, especially in cross-source scenarios. To address these limitations, we shift the focus to the intrinsic geometry of 3D spatial objects and present 3dSAGER (3D Spatial-Aware Geospatial Entity Resolution), an end-to-end pipeline for geospatial entity resolution over 3D objects. 3dSAGER introduces a novel, spatial-reference-independent featurization mechanism that captures intricate geometric characteristics of matching pairs, enabling robust comparison even across datasets with incompatible coordinate systems where traditional spatial methods fail. As a key component of 3dSAGER, we also propose a new lightweight and interpretable blocking method, BKAFI, that leverages a trained model to efficiently generate high-recall candidate sets. We validate 3dSAGER through extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, demonstrating significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency over strong baselines. Our empirical study further dissects the contributions of each component, providing insights into their impact and the overall design choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u71263D\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa3dSAGER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u542b\u65b0\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4e0eBKAFI\u963b\u585e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u60013D\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u5e26\u6765\u673a\u9047\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6216\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3dSAGER\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u53c2\u8003\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u963b\u585e\u65b9\u6cd5BKAFI\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c3dSAGER\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "3dSAGER\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5256\u6790\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate a lightweight approach to improve T2V diffusion models using synthetic supervision. We first generate text-rich images using a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, then animate them into short videos using a text-agnostic image-to-video (I2v) model. These synthetic video-prompt pairs are used to fine-tune Wan2.1, a pre-trained T2V model, without any architectural changes.

We investigate how to construct RLVR datasets (i.e., RL prompts) and present practical training techniques that yield strong performance on competitive-programming code generation. Our pipeline begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) distilled from strong open-source models, augmented with general-purpose and reasoning-intensive data. RL then follows a two-stage process with executable, testcase-driven rewards: first, training on a large, uniformly distributed set of competitive-programming problems using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with 8 rollouts per prompt and a relatively short response-generation window (e.g., 32k during SFT and 24k in this stage) to expand entropy and mitigate repetition and truncation; second, we perform \\textbf{Pre-GRPO}: updating on a small, high-quality set of challenging problems with a large rollout budget (64 rollouts per prompt) under a hard-focus curriculum that continuously retains the most difficult instances throughout training. We implement our method on Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate on LeetCode and Codeforces weekly contests to avoid data leakage. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and is comparable to leading systems such as DeepSeek v3.1 and Doubao-1.5-Thinking.

Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed.

These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which computes molecular shingle differences to capture reaction-specific structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks.

Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($\u03b5$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\\% reduction in communication overhead.

Departing from conventional autoencoder and neural network pipelines, the proposed method leverages the MedGemma foundation model, incorporating a SigLIP-derived vision encoder pretrained on diverse medical imaging modalities. Preprocessed X-ray images are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using the MedGemma vision backbone, which are subsequently passed through a lightweight multilayer perceptron for binary classification. Experimental assessment reveals that the MedGemma-driven classifier exhibits strong performance, exceeding conventional convolutional and autoencoder-based metrics. Additionally, the model leverages MedGemma's transfer learning capabilities, enhancing generalization and optimizing feature engineering.

In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization.

TTRL leverages an elegant two-phase sampling strategy: first, multi-sampling derives a pseudo-label via majority voting, while subsequent downsampling and reward-based fine-tuning encourages the model to explore and learn diverse valid solutions, with the pseudo-label modulating the reward signal. Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates. However, TTRL's two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which can potentially improve pseudo-label accuracy in the initial exploitation phase while regulating exploration in the second.

Author manuscript accepted for the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26), January 2026", "summary": "Existing graph neural networks typically rely on heuristic choices for hidden dimensions and propagation depths, which often lead to severe information loss during propagation, known as over-squashing. To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that increasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the role of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance between information compression and representation complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faC3E\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC3E\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u628a\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cC3E\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u6e90\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u77e9\u9635\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f20\u64ad\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f5c\u7528\u66f4\u5fae\u5999\u3002", "conclusion": "C3E\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Although general capability evaluations are widespread, social impact assessments covering bias, fairness, privacy, environmental costs, and labor practices remain uneven across the AI ecosystem. To characterize this landscape, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of both first-party and third-party social impact evaluation reporting across a wide range of model developers. Our study examines 186 first-party release reports and 183 post-release evaluation sources, and complements this quantitative analysis with interviews of model developers. We find a clear division of evaluation labor: first-party reporting is sparse, often superficial, and has declined over time in key areas such as environmental impact and bias, while third-party evaluators including academic researchers, nonprofits, and independent organizations provide broader and more rigorous coverage of bias, harmful content, and performance disparities. However, this complementarity has limits. Only model developers can authoritatively report on data provenance, content moderation labor, financial costs, and training infrastructure, yet interviews reveal that these disclosures are often deprioritized unless tied to product adoption or regulatory compliance.

Specifically, FLEX cultivates scalable and inheritable evolution by constructing a structured experience library through continual reflection on successes and failures during interaction with the environment. FLEX delivers substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning, chemical retrosynthesis, and protein fitness prediction (up to 23% on AIME25, 10% on USPTO50k, and 14% on ProteinGym).

Current fusion methods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a limited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue presents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of specific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical applications. On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains. To complement this, we have also developed an open-source, unified, and automated evaluation pipeline that includes standardized implementations of state-of-the-art models and diverse fusion paradigms.

In this work, we present the first framework for personalized image editing in diffusion models, introducing Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO), a novel method that aligns image edits with user-specific preferences while leveraging collaborative signals from like-minded individuals. Our approach encodes each user as a node in a dynamic preference graph and learns embeddings via a lightweight graph neural network, enabling information sharing across users with overlapping visual tastes. We enhance a diffusion model's editing capabilities by integrating these personalized embeddings into a novel DPO objective, which jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence. Comprehensive experiments, including user studies and quantitative benchmarks, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines in generating edits that are aligned with user preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6C - DPO\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e2a\u4f53\u7528\u6237\u7ec6\u5fae\u5ba1\u7f8e\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC - DPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u504f\u597d\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5c06\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u65b0\u7684DPO\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\uff09\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f7f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u3002"}}

This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay.

At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a powerful force in education, with the potential to address major challenges, personalize learning, and innovate teaching practices. However, these advances come with significant risks: rapid AI development can undermine human agency, exacerbate inequities, and outpace our capacity to guide its use with sound policy. Human learning presupposes cognitive efforts and social interaction (dialogues). In response to this evolving landscape, an international workshop titled \"Educational Dialogue: Moving Thinking Forward\" convened 19 leading researchers from 11 countries in Cambridge (September 1-3, 2025) to examine the intersection of AI and educational dialogue. This AI-focused strand of the workshop centered on three critical questions: (1) When is AI truly useful in education, and when might it merely replace human effort at the expense of learning?

We propose Sequence-level TopK (SeqTopK), a minimal modification that shifts the expert budget from the token level to the sequence level. By selecting the top $T \\cdot K$ experts across all $T$ tokens, SeqTopK enables end-to-end learned dynamic allocation -- assigning more experts to difficult tokens and fewer to easy ones -- while preserving the same overall budget. SeqTopK requires only a few lines of code, adds less than 1% overhead, and remains fully compatible with pretrained MoE models. Experiments across math, coding, law, and writing show consistent improvements over TopK and prior parameter-free adaptive methods, with gains that become substantially larger under higher sparsity (up to 16.9%).

Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model.

However, generating these explanations for multivariate time series presents challenges due to their complex, multi-dimensional nature. Traditional Nearest Unlike Neighbor-based methods typically substitute subsequences in a queried time series with influential subsequences from an NUN, which is not always realistic in real-world scenarios due to the rigid direct substitution. Counterfactual with Residual Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods aim to address this by learning from the distribution of observed data to generate synthetic counterfactual explanations. However, these methods primarily focus on minimizing the cost from the queried time series to the counterfactual explanations and often neglect the importance of distancing the counterfactual explanation from the decision boundary. This oversight can result in explanations that no longer qualify as counterfactual if minor changes occur within the model. To generate a more robust counterfactual explanation, we introduce TriShGAN, under the CounteRGAN framework enhanced by the incorporation of triplet loss. This unsupervised learning approach uses distance metric learning to encourage the counterfactual explanations not only to remain close to the queried time series but also to capture the feature distribution of the instance with the desired outcome, thereby achieving a better balance between minimal cost and robustness. Additionally, we integrate a Shapelet Extractor that strategically selects the most discriminative parts of the high-dimensional queried time series to enhance the sparsity of counterfactual explanation and efficiency of the training process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165 TriShGAN \u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8fd8\u96c6\u6210 Shapelet Extractor \u63d0\u5347\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e Nearest Unlike Neighbor \u548c Residual Generative Adversarial Networks \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u76f4\u63a5\u66ff\u6362\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "method": "\u5728 CounteRGAN \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5f15\u5165 TriShGAN\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u96c6\u6210 Shapelet Extractor \u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "TriShGAN \u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cShapelet Extractor \u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements.

A critical yet often overlooked barrier lies in the computational and memory limitations of RAN baseband hardware, particularly in legacy 4th Generation (4G) systems, which typically lack on-chip neural accelerators. As a result, only lightweight AI models (under 1 Mb and sub-100~\u03bcs inference time) can be effectively deployed, limiting both their performance and applicability. However, achieving strong generalization across diverse network conditions often requires large-scale models with substantial resource demands. To address this trade-off, this paper investigates policy distillation in the context of a reinforcement learning-based link adaptation task. We explore two strategies: single-policy distillation, where a scenario-agnostic teacher model is compressed into one generalized student model; and multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student. Experimental evaluations in a high-fidelity, 5th Generation (5G)-compliant simulator demonstrate that both strategies produce compact student models that preserve the teachers' generalization capabilities while complying with the computational and memory limitations of existing RAN hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9RAN\u4e2dAI\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u94fe\u8def\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u4e14\u4fdd\u7559\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "RAN\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528AI\u9762\u4e34\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5f02\u6784\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f4G\u7cfb\u7edf\u786c\u4ef6\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7AI\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u94fe\u8def\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\uff08\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\uff08\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f5G\u5408\u89c4\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u90fd\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53c8\u7b26\u5408\u73b0\u6709RAN\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u662f\u89e3\u51b3RAN\u4e2dAI\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d85100\u4e07\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790VLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u5c55\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528VLMs\u548c\u63a8\u7406LLMs\u5408\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03Qwen2.5 - VL - 7B\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u5177\u8eabQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636eSFT\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebfRL\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636eSFT\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we contribute to this perspective by proposing novel optimistic online-to-batch conversions that incorporate optimism theoretically into the analysis, thereby significantly simplifying the online algorithm design while preserving the optimal convergence rates. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our conversions through the following results: (i) when combined with simple online gradient descent, our optimistic conversion achieves the optimal accelerated convergence; (ii) our conversion also applies to strongly convex objectives, and by leveraging both optimistic online-to-batch conversion and optimistic online algorithms, we achieve the optimal accelerated convergence rate for strongly convex and smooth objectives, for the first time through the lens of online-to-batch conversion; (iii) our optimistic conversion can achieve universality to smoothness -- applicable to both smooth and non-smooth objectives without requiring knowledge of the smoothness coefficient -- and remains efficient as non-universal methods by using only one gradient query in each iteration.

However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on accuracy and output quality, and they ignore an important factor: decoding token efficiency. In real systems, generating 10,000 tokens versus 100,000 tokens leads to large differences in latency, cost, and energy. In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation.

However, in deep architectures, this process often leads to diminished expressiveness. A popular solution is to use residual connections, where the input from the current (or initial) layer is added to aggregated neighbor information to preserve embeddings across layers. Following a recent line of research, we investigate an adaptive residual scheme in which different nodes have varying residual strengths. We prove that this approach prevents oversmoothing; particularly, we show that the Dirichlet energy of the embeddings remains bounded away from zero. This is the first theoretical guarantee not only for the adaptive setting, but also for static residual connections (where residual strengths are shared across nodes) with activation functions. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that this adaptive approach outperforms standard and state-of-the-art message passing mechanisms, especially on heterophilic graphs. To improve the time complexity of our approach, we introduce a variant in which residual strengths are not learned but instead set heuristically, a choice that performs as well as the learnable version.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6848\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9632\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u80fd\u91cf\u6709\u754c\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d8\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7248\u672c\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d8\u4f53\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics.

A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5f31\u60e9\u7f5a\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08WP - NODE\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u77ed\u671f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5f31\u516c\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5178\u5f3a\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u8865\u5145\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08NODE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u5f31\u516c\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u5f3a\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684WP - NODE\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "WP - NODE\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Analysis identified three themes: person-centered contextualization responsive to momentary needs, explicit boundaries around scope and offline referral, and dialogic scaffolding for reflection and autonomy. We mapped these themes to persuasive design features for task suggestions, social facilitation, and system trustworthiness, and created corresponding dialogue extracts to guide LLM fine-tuning.

Existing data synthesis methods often exacerbate this problem by creating data with symmetric utility, allowing any party to extract its value. This paper introduces the Encapsulation-Forging (EnFo) framework, a novel approach to generate rival synthetic data with asymmetric utility. EnFo operates in two stages: it first encapsulates predictive knowledge from the original data into a designated ``key'' model, and then forges a synthetic dataset by optimizing the data to intentionally overfit this key model. This process transforms non-rival data into a rival product, ensuring its value is accessible only to the intended model, thereby preventing unauthorized use and preserving the data owner's competitive edge. Our framework demonstrates remarkable sample efficiency, matching the original data's performance with a fraction of its size, while providing robust privacy protection and resistance to misuse.

Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm. However, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of road networks raise severe challenges to the neighborhood smoothing mechanism of self-supervised GNNs. To address these issues, we propose a $\\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\\textbf{S}$patial-$\\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST. On one hand, DST designs a mix-hop transition matrix for graph convolution to incorporate dynamic relations of roads from trajectories. Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations.

Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities.

Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting.

Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9\\% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark.

Although churn prediction and demand forecasting have been widely studied in B2B contexts, the use of machine learning to guide asset allocation remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a framework focused on predicting which beverage clients are most likely to deliver strong returns in volume after receiving a cooler. Using a private dataset from a well-known Central American brewing and beverage company of 3,119 B2B traditional trade channel clients that received a cooler from 2022-01 to 2024-07, and tracking 12 months of sales transactions before and after cooler installation, three growth thresholds were defined: 10%, 30% and 50% growth in sales volume year over year. The analysis compares results of machine learning models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost combined with SHAP for interpretable feature analysis in order to have insights into improving business operations related to cooler allocation; the results show that the best model has AUC scores of 0.857, 0.877, and 0.898 across the thresholds on the validation set.

To bridge this gap, we present the first large-scale study of 17 third-party chatbot plugins used by over 10,000 public websites, uncovering previously unknown prompt injection risks in practice. First, 8 of these plugins (used by 8,000 websites) fail to enforce the integrity of the conversation history transmitted in network requests between the website visitor and the chatbot. This oversight amplifies the impact of direct prompt injection attacks by allowing adversaries to forge conversation histories (including fake system messages), boosting their ability to elicit unintended behavior (e.g., code generation) by 3 to 8x. Second, 15 plugins offer tools, such as web-scraping, to enrich the chatbot's context with website-specific content. However, these tools do not distinguish the website's trusted content (e.g., product descriptions) from untrusted, third-party content (e.g., customer reviews), introducing a risk of indirect prompt injection. Notably, we found that ~13% of e-commerce websites have already exposed their chatbots to third-party content. We systematically evaluate both vulnerabilities through controlled experiments grounded in real-world observations, focusing on factors such as system prompt design and the underlying LLM. Our findings show that many plugins adopt insecure practices that undermine the built-in LLM safeguards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf917\u4e2a\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d2\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u63d2\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u505a\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u5e94\u7528\u5982\u5ba2\u670d\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u72b6\u51b5\u53ca\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf917\u4e2a\u88ab\u8d8510000\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u7f51\u7ad9\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d2\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "result": "8\u4e2a\u63d2\u4ef6\u672a\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\u653e\u5927\uff1b15\u4e2a\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f15\u5165\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7ea613%\u7535\u5546\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5df2\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bb8\u591a\u63d2\u4ef6\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u505a\u6cd5\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u7f6e\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion \"Teacher\" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled \"Student\" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods.

While cognitive tests and clinical data are routinely collected, they lack the predictive power of PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis, which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for every patient. To address this cost-accuracy dilemma, we design a two-stage machine learning framework that selectively obtains advanced, costly features based on their predicted \"value of information\". We apply our framework to predict AD progression for MCI patients using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework reduces the need for advanced testing by 20% while achieving a test AUROC of 0.929, comparable to the model that uses both basic and advanced features (AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010). We also provide an example interpretability analysis showing how one may explain the triage decision. Our work presents an interpretable, data-driven framework that optimizes AD diagnostic pathways and balances accuracy with cost, representing a step towards making early, reliable AD prediction more accessible in real-world practice.

At each layer, a causal block performs a soft split into causal and non-causal branches, fuses causal evidence across modalities, and progressively removes batch-coupled context to focus on label-relevant structure, thereby limiting shortcut signals and stabilizing layerwise refinement. Across four molecular benchmarks, CLaP consistently improves MAE, MSE, and $R^2$ over competitive baselines.

ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis.

Since sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI) arise from the mis-tuning of control gains under specific grid configurations, effective mitigation strategies require adaptive re-tuning of these gains. Such adaptiveness can be achieved by employing a closed-loop, learning-based framework that considers the grid conditions responsible for such sub-synchronous oscillations. This paper addresses this need by adopting methodologies inspired by Markov decision process (MDP) based reinforcement learning (RL), with a particular emphasis on simpler deep policy gradient methods with additional SSCI-specific signal processing modules such as down-sampling, bandpass filtering, and oscillation energy dependent reward computations.

Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\\times$ and $18\\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Cross - Layer Fusion Adapter\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528CLIP\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u65e9\u671fAD\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684AD\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b14\u8ff9\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Cross - Layer Fusion Adapter\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u690d\u5165\u591a\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u80fd\u533a\u5206AD\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e66\u5199\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u51fa\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u65e9\u671fAD\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7b14\u753b\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Code available at https://github.com/ajavid34/guided-info-diffusion", "summary": "Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining.

In this work, we show that the majority of new capabilities in reasoning models can be elicited by small, single-rank changes to base model parameters, with many of these changes being interpretable. Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors. Finally, we train a sparse autoencoder on the entire activation state of this LoRA and identify fine-grained and monosemantic features. Our findings highlight that reasoning performance can arise largely from minimal changes to base model parameters, and explore what these changes affect.

Yet the exponential growth of the search space of expression renders the task computationally challenging. A promising yet underexplored direction for reducing the effective search space and accelerating training lies in symbolic equivalence: many expressions, although syntactically different, define the same function -- for example, $\\log(x_1^2x_2^3)$, $\\log(x_1^2)+\\log(x_2^3)$, and $2\\log(x_1)+3\\log(x_2)$. Existing algorithms treat such variants as distinct outputs, leading to redundant exploration and slow learning. We introduce EGG-SR, a unified framework that integrates equality graphs (e-graphs) into diverse symbolic regression algorithms, including Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and large language models (LLMs). EGG-SR compactly represents equivalent expressions through the proposed EGG module, enabling more efficient learning by: (1) pruning redundant subtree exploration in EGG-MCTS, (2) aggregating rewards across equivalence classes in EGG-DRL, and (3) enriching feedback prompts in EGG-LLM. Under mild assumptions, we show that embedding e-graphs tightens the regret bound of MCTS and reduces the variance of the DRL gradient estimator. Empirically, EGG-SR consistently enhances multiple baselines across challenging benchmarks, discovering equations with lower normalized mean squared error than state-of-the-art methods.

Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning.

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7f16\u8f91\u4f1a\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5fae\u8c03\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u7f16\u8f91\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u53bb\u9664\u6076\u610f\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u76ca\u7f16\u8f91\u4e24\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u91cf\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c232\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u7f16\u8f91\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u4f1a\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b58\u6d3b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cAlphaEdit\u7f16\u8f91\u6bd4MEMIT\u7f16\u8f91\u8870\u51cf\u66f4\u591a\uff1b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u8f7b\u5fae\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u975e\u7f16\u8f91\u5c42\u6bd4\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u635f\u5bb3\u66f4\u591a\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6574\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u8003\u8651\u5b8c\u6574\u5e94\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Token-shift analyses indicate that DTA concentrates gains on logical-structural discourse markers rather than merely amplifying domain nouns, indicating improved reasoning scaffolding. Under edge-like inference settings, DTA improves efficiency by reducing reliance on multi-sample voting and disabling expensive reasoning heuristics, cutting energy per output token by ~42% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode enabled) and end-to-end latency by ~60% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode disabled).

A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \\emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \\emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $\u03b2$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift.

To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance.

To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling.

Parameter sharing, a form of structured compression, effectively reduces redundancy, but existing approaches remain heuristic-restricted to adjacent layers and lacking a systematic analysis for cross-layer sharing. However, extending sharing across multiple layers leads to an exponentially expanding configuration space, making exhaustive search computationally infeasible and forming a critical bottleneck for parameter sharing. We recast parameter sharing from a group-theoretic perspective as introducing structural symmetries in the model's parameter space. A sharing configuration can be described by a coloring function $\u03b1:L\\rightarrow C$ (L: layer indices and C: sharing classes), which determines inter-layer sharing groups while preserving structural symmetry. To determine the coloring function, we propose a second-order geometric criterion based on Taylor expansion and the Hessian spectrum. By projecting perturbations onto the Hessian's low-curvature eigensubspace, the criterion provides an analytic rule for selecting sharing groups that minimize performance impact, yielding a principled and scalable configuration procedure.

We contribute a working Chrome/Edge prototype implementing five representative pattern frameworks--Context-Aware Post Rewriter, Post Integrity Meter, Granular Feed Curator, Micro-Withdrawal Agent, and Recovery Mode--alongside a unifying mathematical formulation balancing user utility, autonomy costs, and risk thresholds. Evaluation spans technical accuracy, usability, and behavioral outcomes. The result is a suite of humane controls that help users rewrite before harm, read with integrity cues, tune feeds with intention, pause compulsive loops, and seek shelter during harassment, all while preserving agency through explanations and override options. This prototype offers a practical path to retrofit today's feeds with safety, agency, and well-being, inviting rigorous cross-cultural user evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHuman - Layer AI\uff08HL - AI\uff09\uff0c\u6709Chrome/Edge\u539f\u578b\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u9020\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5e73\u53f0\u4ee5\u5438\u5f15\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e3a\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e26\u6765\u538b\u529b\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5931\u63a7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHL - AI\uff0c\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u754c\u9762\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e94\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6280\u672f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u5957\u4eba\u6027\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u907f\u514d\u4f24\u5bb3\u3001\u8bda\u4fe1\u9605\u8bfb\u3001\u8c03\u6574\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3001\u6682\u505c\u5f3a\u8feb\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u8eb2\u907f\u9a9a\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u539f\u578b\u4e3a\u6539\u9020\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u5e78\u798f\u611f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. On textual tasks, MIP-Editor achieves up to 80.65% forgetting and preserves 77.9% of general performance.

Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \\approx 0.45\\text{--}0.55$).

Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting.

By perturbing the input given to \"victim\" LLMs in three closed-book and fact-based QA settings, we undermine the correctness of the responses and assess the uncertainty of their generation process.

These include Poisson kernels, gradient kernels, signs and magnitudes of weights. DeepRWCap employs a two-stage neural architecture that decomposes structured outputs into face-wise distributions and spatial kernels on cube faces.

The design incorporates grid-based positional encodings and structural design choices informed by cube symmetries to reduce learning redundancy and improve generalization. Trained on 100,000 procedurally generated dielectric configurations, DeepRWCap achieves a mean relative error of $1.24\\pm0.53$\\% when benchmarked against the commercial Raphael solver on the self-capacitance estimation of 10 industrial designs spanning 12 to 55 nm nodes.

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations.

Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1.

First, M2M-DC ranks residual (or inverted-residual) blocks by a label-aware mutual information (MI) signal and removes the least informative units (structured prune-after-training). It then alternates short KD phases with stage-coherent, residual-safe channel slicing: (i) stage \"planes\" (co-slicing conv2 out-channels with the downsample path and next-stage inputs), and (ii) an optional mid-channel trim (conv1 out / bn1 / conv2 in). This targets complementary redundancy, whole computational motifs and within-stage width while preserving residual shape invariants. On CIFAR-100, M2M-DC yields a clean accuracy-compute frontier. For ResNet-18, we obtain 85.46% Top-1 with 3.09M parameters and 0.0139 GMacs (72% params, 63% GMacs vs. teacher; mean final 85.29% over three seeds). For ResNet-34, we reach 85.02% Top-1 with 5.46M params and 0.0195 GMacs (74% / 74% vs. teacher; mean final 84.62%). Extending to inverted-residuals, MobileNetV2 achieves a mean final 68.54% Top-1 at 1.71M params (27%) and 0.0186 conv GMacs (24%), improving over the teacher's 66.03% by +2.5 points across three seeds.

In the UAE, concentrated authority, credible sanctions, pro-innovation narratives, and flexible reinvestment rules scale pilots into hundreds of services and sizable recycled savings. In Kuwait, dispersed veto points, exhortative sanctions, cautious discourse, and lapsed AI budgets confine initiatives to pilot mode despite equivalent fiscal resources.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) presents a promising solution, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning by updating only a small number of adaptation weights per layer. Traditional PEFT methods typically rely on a single expert, where the adaptation weight is a low-rank matrix. However, for complex tasks, the data's inherent diversity poses a significant challenge for such models, as a single adaptation weight cannot adequately capture the features of all samples. To address this limitation, we explore how to integrate multiple small adaptation experts into a compact structure to defeat a large adapter. Specifically, we propose Tucker Adaptation (TuckA), a method with four key properties: (i) We use Tucker decomposition to create a compact 3D tensor where each slice naturally serves as an expert. The low-rank nature of this decomposition ensures that the number of parameters scales efficiently as more experts are added. (ii) We introduce a hierarchical strategy that organizes these experts into groups at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both local and global data patterns. (iii) We develop an efficient batch-level routing mechanism, which reduces the router's parameter size by a factor of $L$ compared to routing at every adapted layer (where $L$ is the number of adapted layers) (iv) We propose data-aware initialization to achieve loss-free expert load balancing based on theoretical analysis.

We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement \"code 57.95 refers to urinary infection\") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., \"what is code 57.95\") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7eaf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u7f29\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0cRL\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u904d\u5386\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u8ba4\u4e3aRL\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76RL\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4RL\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u548cSFT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7eaf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfcSFT\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u5185\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "RL\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7eaf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0eRL\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46RL\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56de\u5fc6\u6b63\u786e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1bSFT\u548cRL\u6a21\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u8868\u793a\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6e90\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u904d\u5386\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\u3002"}}

This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: a Kalman Smoothing Post-processor that provably operates as a statistically optimal estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. The synergy between these two components allows COGNOS to robustly separate the true anomaly signal from random fluctuations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGNOS is highly effective, delivering an average F-score uplift of 57.9% when applied to 12 diverse backbone models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets.

However, they often struggle under challenging conditions, where noise disrupts similarity computation and leads to incorrect correspondences. Moreover, without dedicated designs, it remains difficult to effectively select informative and correlated representations across modalities, thereby limiting the robustness and accuracy of registration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-modal registration framework composed of two key modules: the Iterative Agents Selection (IAS) module and the Reliable Agents Interaction (RAI) module.

Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI.

Recent works improve this by introducing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, with the pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) used as teachers and the target SNNs as students. This is commonly accomplished through a straightforward element-wise alignment of intermediate features and prediction logits from ANNs and SNNs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences between their architectures. Specifically, ANN's outputs exhibit a continuous distribution, whereas SNN's outputs are characterized by sparsity and discreteness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two innovative KD strategies. Firstly, we propose the Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD), which aligns the spike activation map of the student SNN with the class-aware activation map of the teacher ANN. Rather than performing KD directly on the raw %and distinct features of ANN and SNN, our SAMD directs the student to learn from saliency activation maps that exhibit greater semantic and distribution consistency. Additionally, we propose a Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD), which utilizes Gaussian noise to smooth the sparse logits of student SNN, facilitating the alignment with continuous logits from teacher ANN. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively.

This study focuses on the relatively underexplored problem of generating counterfactual explanations for time series forecasting. We propose a method for extracting CEs in time series forecasting using exogenous variables, which are frequently encountered in fields such as business and marketing.

To meet this need, data is collected from multiple domains, such as Wikipedia and GitHub. These domains are heterogeneous in both data quality and the diversity of information they provide. This raises the question of how much we should rely on each domain. Several methods have attempted to address this issue by assigning sampling weights to each data domain using heuristics or approximations. As a first step toward a deeper understanding of the role of data mixing, this work revisits the problem by studying two kinds of weights: sampling weights, which control how much each domain contributes in a batch, and loss weights, which scale the loss from each domain during training. Through a rigorous study of linear regression, we show that these two weights play complementary roles. First, they can reduce the variance of gradient estimates in iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Second, they can improve generalization performance by reducing the generalization gap. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for these claims. We further study the joint dynamics of sampling weights and loss weights, examining how they can be combined to capture both contributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65f6\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e8c\u8005\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5404\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\uff0c\u9700\u660e\u786e\u5404\u9886\u57df\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u8005\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5934\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u606f\u5386\u53f2\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56e0\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u8fc7\u53bb\u4ee4\u724c\u5747\u5300\u5206\u914d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5934\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6bcf\u5934\u8bb0\u5fc6\u957f\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684UniZero\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6bd4UniZero\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5206\u6570\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad877%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002"}}

These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers promise in such settings, it remains challenging in tabular domains due to the lack of effective data augmentations. We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases. During training, the OSDT encoder (robust to noise and effective at modeling localized, high-frequency structure) guides the neural encoder toward representations more aligned with tabular data. At inference, only the neural encoder is used, preserving flexibility and SSL compatibility. Spectral analysis highlights the distinct inductive biases of each encoder. Our method achieves consistent gains in low-label classification and regression across diverse tabular datasets, outperforming deep and tree-based supervised baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0eOSDT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u56e0\u5bf9\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u654f\u611f\u7b49\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8868\u683c\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u5c11\u6709\u6548\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0eOSDT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5404\u7531\u968f\u673a\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5b9a\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4f4e\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u53d6\u5f97\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6807\u7b7e\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Conventional approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference (VI) face significant scalability and efficiency limitations. This paper introduces a novel, unifying framework for fast Bayesian updates by leveraging harmonic analysis. We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution. This formulation allows us to exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity -- a substantial improvement over the O(N^2) cost of naive methods.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge inheritance approach named OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer), which consolidates the knowledge of the teacher model into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain. When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation.

This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation.

The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision.

This design enables collaborative benefits by fully leveraging both client-side and shared server-side models.

Existing deep learning methods, from early regression models to recent contrastive learning approaches, primarily rely on structural data while overlooking protein sequences, which are more accessible and can enhance generalizability. However, directly integrating protein sequences poses challenges due to the redundancy and noise in large-scale protein-ligand datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{S$^2$Drug}, a two-stage framework that explicitly incorporates protein \\textbf{S}equence information and 3D \\textbf{S}tructure context in protein-ligand contrastive representation learning. In the first stage, we perform protein sequence pretraining on ChemBL using an ESM2-based backbone, combined with a tailored data sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and noise on both protein and ligand sides. In the second stage, we fine-tune on PDBBind by fusing sequence and structure information through a residue-level gating module, while introducing an auxiliary binding site prediction task. This auxiliary task guides the model to accurately localize binding residues within the protein sequence and capture their 3D spatial arrangement, thereby refining protein-ligand matching.

Existing methods address this problem through depth completion in the image domain, but they overlook the physical characteristics of raw depth images. It has been observed that the presence of invalid depth areas alters the frequency distribution pattern. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) to harmonize the advantages of both spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. Specifically, we consider the distinct properties of amplitude and phase spectra and devise a dedicated spectral fusion module. Meanwhile, the local and global correlations between spatial-domain and frequency-domain features are calculated in a unified embedding space. The gradual mutual representation and refinement encourage the network to fully explore complementary physical characteristics and priors for more accurate depth completion.

However, existing GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions, which is rarely valid in practice. In real-world scenarios, unseen but normal samples may emerge during deployment, leading to a normality shift that degrades the performance of GAD models trained on the original data. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that the degradation arises from (1) semantic confusion, where unseen normal samples are misinterpreted as anomalies due to their novel patterns, and (2) aggregation contamination, where the representations of seen normal nodes are distorted by unseen normals through message aggregation. While retraining or fine-tuning GAD models could be a potential solution to the above challenges, the high cost of model retraining and the difficulty of obtaining labeled data often render this approach impractical in real-world applications. To bridge the gap, we proposed a lightweight and plug-and-play Test-time adaptation framework for correcting Unseen Normal pattErns (TUNE) in GAD. To address semantic confusion, a graph aligner is employed to align the shifted data to the original one at the graph attribute level. Moreover, we utilize the minimization of representation-level shift as a supervision signal to train the aligner, which leverages the estimated aggregation contamination as a key indicator of normality shift. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that TUNE significantly enhances the generalizability of pre-trained GAD models to both synthetic and real unseen normal patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08GAD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684TUNE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GAD\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u540c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u4f1a\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u96be\u83b7\u53d6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTUNE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\u5728\u56fe\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u522b\u5c06\u8f6c\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8868\u793a\u7ea7\u8f6c\u79fb\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u805a\u5408\u6c61\u67d3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTUNE\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GAD\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u672a\u89c1\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TUNE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3GAD\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations.

This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match.

Recent research has increasingly focused on developing such simulated agents to capture a range of learning styles, cognitive development pathways, and social behaviours. Among contemporary simulation techniques, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational research has emerged as a particularly versatile and scalable paradigm. LLMs afford a high degree of linguistic realism and behavioural adaptability, enabling agents to approximate cognitive processes and engage in contextually appropriate pedagogical dialogues. This paper presents a thematic review of empirical and methodological studies utilising LLMs to simulate student behaviour across educational environments. We synthesise current evidence on the capacity of LLM-based agents to emulate learner archetypes, respond to instructional inputs, and interact within multi-agent classroom scenarios. Furthermore, we examine the implications of such systems for curriculum development, instructional evaluation, and teacher training. While LLMs surpass rule-based systems in natural language generation and situational flexibility, ongoing concerns persist regarding algorithmic bias, evaluation reliability, and alignment with educational objectives.

With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter.

Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms.

However, their synergy remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of systematic benchmarks evaluating their integration in clinical risk prediction. In real-world healthcare, identifying features with causal influence on outcomes is crucial for actionable and trustworthy predictions. While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike existing LLM-clinical benchmarks that often focus on a limited set of outcomes, REACT-LLM evaluates 7 clinical outcomes across 2 real-world datasets, comparing 15 prominent LLMs, 6 traditional ML models, and 3 causal discovery (CD) algorithms. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed traditional ML models. Integrating causal features derived from CD algorithms into LLMs offers limited performance gains, primarily due to the strict assumptions of many CD methods, which are often violated in complex clinical data.

However, existing methodologies primarily rely on musical context or natural language as the main modality of interacting with the generative process, which may not be ideal for expert users who seek precise fader-like control over specific musical attributes. In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity.

In this paper, we argue that the predominant approach of simply removing existing biases from models is not enough. Using a paradigm from the psychology literature, we demonstrate that LLMs can spontaneously develop novel social biases about artificial demographic groups even when no inherent differences exist. These biases result in highly stratified task allocations, which are less fair than assignments by human participants and are exacerbated by newer and larger models. In social science, emergent biases like these have been shown to result from exploration-exploitation trade-offs, where the decision-maker explores too little, allowing early observations to strongly influence impressions about entire demographic groups. To alleviate this effect, we examine a series of interventions targeting model inputs, problem structure, and explicit steering. We find that explicitly incentivizing exploration most robustly reduces stratification, highlighting the need for better multifaceted objectives to mitigate bias. These results reveal that LLMs are not merely passive mirrors of human social biases, but can actively create new ones from experience, raising urgent questions about how these systems will shape societies over time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u6fc0\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u65e0\u504f\u6027\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u7eaf\u53bb\u9664\u73b0\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8fd8\u8003\u5bdf\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u6fc0\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

Traditional methods typically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., \"yes/no\") that specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in practical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty due to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities, and the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using simplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the expressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to better capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient fuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original data, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced representations. Based on this foundation, we present fuzzy-label-enhanced algorithms for both single-label and multi-label learning, using the classical K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and multi-label KNN algorithms as illustrative examples.

However, early filming equipment limitations have degraded videos of last-century performances by renowned artists (e.g., low frame rates and resolution), hindering archival efforts. Although space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) has advanced significantly, applying it directly to opera videos remains challenging. The scarcity of datasets impedes the recovery of high frequency details, and existing STVSR methods lack global modeling capabilities, compromising visual quality when handling opera's characteristic large motions. To address these challenges, we pioneer a large scale Chinese Opera Video Clip (COVC) dataset and propose the Mamba-based multiscale fusion network for space-time Opera Video Super-Resolution (MambaOVSR). Specifically, MambaOVSR involves three novel components: the Global Fusion Module (GFM) for motion modeling through a multiscale alternating scanning mechanism, and the Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM) for alignment across different sequence lengths. Additionally, our MambaVR block resolves feature artifacts and positional information loss during alignment. Experimental results on the COVC dataset show that MambaOVSR significantly outperforms the SOTA STVSR method by an average of 1.86 dB in terms of PSNR.

However, this expansion has also exposed IoT networks to increasingly sophisticated security threats, including adversarial attacks targeting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) to deliberately evade detection, induce misclassification, and systematically undermine the reliability and integrity of security defenses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel adversarial detection model that enhances the robustness of IoT IDS against adversarial attacks through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based fingerprinting. Using SHAP's DeepExplainer, we extract attribution fingerprints from network traffic features, enabling the IDS to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarially perturbed inputs. By capturing subtle attribution patterns, the model becomes more resilient to evasion attempts and adversarial manipulations.

Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \\textit{\\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \\emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \\textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training.

To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-DProxy, a novel multi-modal dynamic proxy learning framework that leverages cross-modal alignment through learnable textual proxies. Multi-DProxy introduces 1) gated cross-modal fusion that synthesizes discriminative joint representations by adaptively modeling feature interactions. 2) dual-constraint proxy optimization where user interest constraints enforce semantic consistency with domain concepts while concept constraints employ hard example mining to enhance cluster discrimination. 3) dynamic candidate management that refines textual proxies through iterative clustering feedback.

While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines. Further analysis reveals that ICL performance in AD detection is highly sensitive to the alignment of label semantics and task-specific context, underscoring the importance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning under low-resource conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa EK - ICL \u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u53d9\u8ff0\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ece\u53d9\u8ff0\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa EK - ICL \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a AD \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e EK - ICL \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "AD \u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

However, existing RSSI-based positioning methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to environmental complexity and challenges in processing multi-source information. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-graph heterogeneous GNN framework (MG-HGNN) to enhance spatial awareness and improve positioning performance. In this framework, two graph construction branches perform node and edge embedding, respectively, to generate informative graphs. Subsequently, a heterogeneous graph neural network is employed for graph representation learning, enabling accurate positioning. The MG-HGNN framework introduces the following key innovations: 1) multi-type task-directed graph construction that combines label estimation and feature encoding for richer graph information; 2) a heterogeneous GNN structure that enhances the performance of conventional GNN models. Evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc public datasets demonstrate that MG-HGNN not only achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, but also provides a novel perspective for enhancing GNN-based localization methods. Ablation studies further confirm the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMG - HGNN\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8eRSSI\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eRSSI\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u96be\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMG - HGNN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u652f\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u5d4c\u5165\u751f\u6210\u56fe\uff0c\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5f02\u8d28GNN\u7ed3\u6784\u4e24\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728UJIIndoorLoc\u548cUTSIndoorLoc\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6846\u67b6\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MG - HGNN\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This paper present an overview of the CHIP 2025 Shared Task 2 competition, which aimed to develop state-of-the-art approaches for automatically recommending appro-priate discharge medications using real-world Chinese EHR data. For this task, we constructed CDrugRed, a high-quality dataset consisting of 5,894 de-identified hospitalization records from 3,190 patients in China. This task is challenging due to multi-label nature of medication recommendation, het-erogeneous clinical text, and patient-specific variability in treatment plans. A total of 526 teams registered, with 167 and 95 teams submitting valid results to the Phase A and Phase B leaderboards, respectively. The top-performing team achieved the highest overall performance on the final test set, with a Jaccard score of 0.5102, F1 score of 0.6267, demonstrating the potential of advanced large language model (LLM)-based ensemble systems.

Building on this perspective, we develop a thermodynamic framework to describe the stationary distributions of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with weight decay for scale-invariant neural networks, a setting that both reflects practical architectures with normalization layers and permits theoretical analysis. We establish analogies between training hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, weight decay) and thermodynamic variables such as temperature, pressure, and volume. Starting with a simplified isotropic noise model, we uncover a close correspondence between SGD dynamics and ideal gas behavior, validated through theory and simulation.

Existing approaches typically navigate to proximity-based regions without considering affordances, resulting in frequent manipulation failures. We propose Affordance-Guided Coarse-to-Fine Exploration, a zero-shot framework for base placement that integrates semantic understanding from vision-language models (VLMs) with geometric feasibility through an iterative optimization process. Our method constructs cross-modal representations, namely Affordance RGB and Obstacle Map+, to align semantics with spatial context. This enables reasoning that extends beyond the egocentric limitations of RGB perception. To ensure interaction is guided by task-relevant affordances, we leverage coarse semantic priors from VLMs to guide the search toward task-relevant regions and refine placements with geometric constraints, thereby reducing the risk of convergence to local optima. Evaluated on five diverse open-vocabulary mobile manipulation tasks, our system achieves an 85% success rate, significantly outperforming classical geometric planners and VLM-based methods.

While these expressive models do not yet match the peak performance of state-of-the-art Transformers, their potential has been largely untapped due to prohibitively slow training and low hardware utilization. Existing parallelization methods force a fundamental conflict governed by the chunksize hyperparameter: large chunks boost speed but degrade performance, necessitating a fixed, suboptimal compromise. To solve this challenge, we introduce TNT, a novel training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance through a two-stage process. Stage one is an efficiency-focused pre-training phase utilizing a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details. Crucially, by periodically resetting local memory states, we break sequential dependencies to enable massive context parallelization. Stage two is a brief fine-tuning phase where only the local memory modules are adapted to a smaller, high-resolution chunksize, maximizing accuracy with minimal overhead. Evaluated on Titans and TTT models, TNT achieves a substantial acceleration in training speed-up to 17 times faster than the most accurate baseline configuration - while simultaneously improving model accuracy.

Prior work explores confidence estimation for self-evaluating LLM-scorer systems, with confidence scorers estimating the likelihood of errors in LLM responses. However, most methods focus on single-step outputs and overlook the challenges of multi-step reasoning. In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Our findings demonstrate that self-evaluating LLM systems provide meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning, improving their trustworthiness and providing a practical framework for failure detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u6280\u672f\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9010\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6b65\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u6280\u672f\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u8bc4\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u76f4\u89c2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u6b65\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u4e0a\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\uff0cAUC - ROC\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe15%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While recent work highlights the role of exploration and entropy stability in improving pass@K, empirical evidence points to a paradox: RLVR and ORM/PRM typically reinforce existing tree-like reasoning paths rather than expanding the reasoning scope, raising the question of why exploration helps at all if no new patterns emerge.\n  To reconcile this paradox, we adopt the perspective of Kim et al. (2025), viewing easy (e.g., simplifying a fraction) versus hard (e.g., discovering a symmetry) reasoning steps as low- versus high-probability Markov transitions, and formalize post-training dynamics through Multi-task Tree-structured Markov Chains (TMC). In this tractable model, pretraining corresponds to tree expansion, while post-training corresponds to chain-of-thought reweighting. We show that several phenomena recently observed in empirical studies arise naturally in this setting: (1) RLVR induces a squeezing effect, reducing reasoning entropy and forgetting some correct paths; (2) population rewards of ORM/PRM encourage consistency rather than accuracy, thereby favoring common patterns; and (3) certain rare, high-uncertainty reasoning paths by the base model are responsible for solving hard problem instances.\n  Together, these explain why exploration -- even when confined to the base model's reasoning scope -- remains essential: it preserves access to rare but crucial reasoning traces needed for difficult cases, which are squeezed out by RLVR or unfavored by inference scaling. Building on this, we further show that exploration strategies such as rejecting easy instances and KL regularization help preserve rare reasoning traces.

Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym.

A promising solution is to use cascaded inference, where small, cheap models handle easy queries, and only the hardest examples are escalated to more powerful models. However, existing cascade methods typically rely on supervised training with labeled data, offer no theoretical generalization guarantees, and provide limited control over test-time computational cost. We introduce C3PO (Cost Controlled Cascaded Prediction Optimization), a self-supervised framework for optimizing LLM cascades under probabilistic cost constraints. By focusing on minimizing regret with respect to the most powerful model (MPM), C3PO avoids the need for labeled data by constructing a cascade using only unlabeled model outputs. It leverages conformal prediction to bound the probability that inference cost exceeds a user-specified budget. We provide theoretical guarantees on both cost control and generalization error, and show that our optimization procedure is effective even with small calibration sets. Empirically, C3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, BigBench-Hard and AIME, outperforming strong LLM cascading baselines in both accuracy and cost-efficiency.

The promising Microscaling (MX) standard enables narrow bit-widths for inference and large dynamic ranges for training. However, existing MX multiply-accumulate (MAC) designs face a critical trade-off: integer accumulation requires expensive conversions from narrow floating-point products, while FP32 accumulation suffers from quantization losses and costly normalization. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid precision-scalable reduction tree for MX MACs that combines the benefits of both approaches, enabling efficient mixed-precision accumulation with controlled accuracy relaxation.

However, evaluations on broad downstream tasks reveal a consistent suboptimality of the routers in existing MoE LLMs, which results in a severe performance gap (e.g., 10-20% in accuracy) to the optimal routing. In this paper, we show that aligning the manifold of routing weights with that of task embedding can effectively reduce the gap and improve MoE LLMs' generalization performance. Our method, \"Routing Manifold Alignment (RoMA)\", introduces an additional manifold regularization term in the post-training objective and only requires lightweight finetuning of routers (with other parameters frozen). Specifically, the regularization encourages the routing weights of each sample to be close to those of its successful neighbors (whose routing weights lead to correct answers) in a task embedding space. Consequently, samples targeting similar tasks will share similar expert choices across layers. Building such bindings between tasks and experts over different samples is essential to achieve better generalization. Moreover, RoMA demonstrates the advantage of unifying the task understanding (by embedding models) with solution generation (by MoE LLMs). In experiments, we finetune routers in OLMoE, DeepSeekMoE, and Qwen3-MoE using RoMA.

Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization.

This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively.

This paper introduces GazeVLM, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multi-task gaze understanding in images, addressing person detection, gaze target detection, and gaze object identification. While other transformer-based methods exist for gaze analysis, GazeVLM represents, to our knowledge, the first application of a VLM to these combined tasks, allowing for selective execution of each task. Through the integration of visual (RGB and depth) and textual modalities, our ablation study on visual input combinations revealed that a fusion of RGB images with HHA-encoded depth maps, guided by text prompts, yields superior performance. We also introduce an object-level gaze detection metric for gaze object identification ($AP_{ob}$).

Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive and accessible method for examining cerebral activity and identifying disease-associated patterns. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework, named Edge-gated, axis-mixed Pooling Attention Network (ExPANet), for differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from healthy controls (HC). EEG recordings undergo preprocessing to eliminate artifacts and are segmented into short periods of activity. We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights.

Due to the substantial computational cost and data requirements of training from scratch, many developers choose to fine-tune or modify existing open-source models. While most adhere to open-source licenses, some falsely claim original training despite clear derivation from public models. This raises pressing concerns about intellectual property protection and highlights the need for reliable methods to verify model provenance. In this paper, we propose GhostSpec, a lightweight yet effective method for verifying LLM lineage without access to training data or modification of model behavior. Our approach constructs compact and robust fingerprints by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to invariant products of internal attention weight matrices, effectively capturing the structural identity of a model. Unlike watermarking or output-based methods, GhostSpec is fully data-free, non-invasive, and computationally efficient. It demonstrates strong robustness to sequential fine-tuning, pruning, block expansion, and even adversarial transformations. Extensive experiments show that GhostSpec can reliably trace the lineage of transformed models with minimal overhead.

To address these issues, a Multi-View Clustering method via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network (MCFCN) is proposed. The network learns the consensus graph of multi-view data in an end-to-end manner and learns effective consensus representations through a view feature fusion model and a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA). It designs Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL). With the guidance of consensus, it optimizes view-specific graphs, preserves cross-view topological consistency, promotes the construction of intra-class edges, and realizes effective consensus representation learning with the help of GCN to improve clustering performance.

However, existing benchmarks mainly address explicit hate toward protected groups and often overlook implicit or indirect hate, such as demeaning comparisons, calls for exclusion or violence, and subtle discriminatory language that still causes harm. While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation.

When training Scarf-DETR, we design a pseudo modality dropout strategy to fully utilize the multi-modality information, making the detector compatible and robust to both working modes of single and double modalities. Moreover, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for the modality-incomplete IVOD task aimed at thoroughly assessing situations where the absent modality is either dominant or secondary.

Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) represent two prominent approaches for capturing place-based perceptions that can support urban planning decisions, yet their comparability remains underexplored. This study investigates the alignment between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences gathered via a city-wide PPGIS survey in Helsinki, Finland. Using participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation, we trained a machine learning model to predict perceived attractiveness based on visual features. We compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified locations marked as attractive or unattractive, calculating agreement using two sets of strict and moderate criteria. Our findings reveal only partial alignment between the two datasets. While agreement (with a moderate threshold) reached 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, agreement (with a strict threshold) dropped to 27% and 29%, respectively. By analysing a range of contextual variables, including noise, traffic, population presence, and land use, we found that non-visual cues significantly contributed to mismatches. The model failed to account for experiential dimensions such as activity levels and environmental stressors that shape perceptions but are not visible in images. These results suggest that while SVI offers a scalable and visual proxy for urban perception, it cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. We argue that both methods are valuable but serve different purposes; therefore, a more integrated approach is needed to holistically capture how people perceive urban environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u82ac\u5170\u8d6b\u5c14\u8f9b\u57fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff08SVI\uff09\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08PPGIS\uff09\u8c03\u67e5\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u5c45\u6c11\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9700\u7efc\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5de5\u5177\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\uff0cSVI\u548cPPGIS\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u4e24\u8005\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684SVI\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u611f\u77e5\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u4e0ePPGIS\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u5730\u70b9\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u548c\u5bbd\u677e\u6807\u51c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u80cc\u666f\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5bbd\u677e\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u65e0\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u5730\u70b9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u522b\u8fbe67%\u548c77%\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u964d\u81f327%\u548c29%\uff0c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "SVI\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3PPGIS\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5404\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u9700\u7efc\u5408\u8fd0\u7528\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002"}}

This perspectives paper evaluates emerging solutions to the Alpine energy-climate data gap, analyzing datasets from global reanalyses (ERA5, 31 km) to kilometre-scale Digital Twins (Climate DT, Extremes DT, 4.4 km), regional reanalyses (ARA, 2.5 km), and next-generation AI weather prediction models (AIFS, 31 km). The multi-resolution assessment reveals that no single dataset excels universally: coarse reanalyses provide essential climatologies but miss valley-scale processes, while Digital Twins resolve Alpine dynamics yet remain computationally demanding. Effective energy planning therefore requires strategic dataset combinations validated against energy-relevant indices such as population-weighted extremes, wind-gust return periods, and Alpine-adjusted storm thresholds. A key frontier is sub-hourly (10-15 min) temporal resolution to match grid-operation needs. Six evidence-based recommendations outline pathways for bridging spatial and temporal scales.

However, by relying on a final softmax classifier, these methods suffer from two fundamental distortions: additive logit shifts that arbitrarily bias importance scores, and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features. We propose a simple, architecture-agnostic dual-branch sigmoid head that decouples localization from classification. Given any pretrained model, we clone its classification head into a parallel branch ending in per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax retains recognition accuracy, while class evidence maps are generated from the sigmoid branch -- preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants and incurs negligible overhead.

SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks.

On the downside, they are prone to cause overtrust issues where users rely on their responses even when they are incorrect. What aspects of the conversational interaction paradigm drive people to adopt it, and how it creates personalized experiences that lead to overtrust, is not clear. To understand the factors influencing the adoption of conversational interfaces, we conducted a survey with 173 participants. We examined user perceptions regarding trust, human-likeness (anthropomorphism), and design preferences between ChatGPT and Google. To better understand the overtrust phenomenon, we asked users about their willingness to trade off factuality for constructs like ease of use or human-likeness. Our analysis identified two distinct user groups: those who use both ChatGPT and Google daily (DUB), and those who primarily rely on Google (DUG). The DUB group exhibited higher trust in ChatGPT, perceiving it as more human-like, and expressed greater willingness to trade factual accuracy for enhanced personalization and conversational flow. Conversely, the DUG group showed lower trust toward ChatGPT but still appreciated aspects like ad-free experiences and responsive interactions. Demographic analysis further revealed nuanced patterns, with middle-aged adults using ChatGPT less frequently yet trusting it more, suggesting potential vulnerability to misinformation.

Recovering similar room impulse response (RIR) directly from reverberant speech offers more accessible and flexible AEM solution. However, this capability also introduces vulnerabilities of arbitrary ``relocation\" if misused by malicious user, such as facilitating advanced voice spoofing attacks or undermining the authenticity of recorded evidence. To address this issue, we propose EchoMark, the first deep learning-based AEM framework that generates perceptually similar RIRs with embedded watermark. Our design tackle the challenges posed by variable RIR characteristics, such as different durations and energy decays, by operating in the latent domain. By jointly optimizing the model with a perceptual loss for RIR reconstruction and a loss for watermark detection, EchoMark achieves both high-quality environment transfer and reliable watermark recovery. Experiments on diverse datasets validate that EchoMark achieves room acoustic parameter matching performance comparable to FiNS, the state-of-the-art RIR estimator.

In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

Despite excelling on natural images, VLMs often struggle with stylized line art, onomatopoeia, and densely packed multi-panel layouts. To address this gap, we introduce AI4VA-FG, the first fine-grained and comprehensive benchmark for VLM-based comic understanding. It spans tasks from foundational recognition and detection to high-level character reasoning and narrative construction, supported by dense annotations for characters, poses, and depth. Beyond that, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5, and open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL, revealing substantial performance deficits across core tasks of our benchmarks and underscoring that comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge. To enhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate post-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions (SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and reinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through zoom-in operations. We observe that when applied to the Qwen2.5-VL model, RL and RARL yield significant gains in low-level entity recognition and high-level storyline ordering, paving the way for more accurate and efficient VLM applications in the comics domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165AI4VA - FG\u6f2b\u753b\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347VLM\u5728\u6f2b\u753b\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6f2b\u753b\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u53d9\u4e8b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u6f2b\u753b\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AI4VA - FG\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7814\u7a76SFT - S\u3001SFT - R\u3001RL\u7b49\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1bRL\u548cRARL\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eQwen2.5 - VL\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u522b\u6545\u4e8b\u7ebf\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f2b\u753b\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u662f\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0cRARL\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aVLM\u5728\u6f2b\u753b\u9886\u57df\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Detecting and mitigating hallucinations is challenging when ground-truth references are unavailable and model internals are inaccessible. This paper proposes a novel self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate captions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using only the captions themselves without requiring external references or model access. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a low-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual magnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the most hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a 6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by sparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of hallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism.

However, empirical results are mixed and often unreliable, particularly for typologically distant or low-resource languages (LRLs) compared to English. Moreover, word realignment tools often rely on high-quality parallel data, which can be scarce or noisy for many LRLs. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs. This indicates that effective realignment does not require exhaustive language coverage and can reduce data collection overhead, while remaining both efficient and robust when guided by informed language selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u8bed\u8a00\u5b50\u96c6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u5426\u5229\u7528\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6216\u9009\u62e9\u5b50\u96c6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u53ca\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b50\u96c6\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u3002"}}

This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200. We focus on extending Flores-200 benchmark to these languages, and further align the translated texts with topic labels based on SIB-200 classification dataset.

To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation.

Digitised audio samples are converted into spike trains using leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, encrypted via a modulo-based mapping scheme, and embedded into the least significant bits of RGBA image channels using a dithering mechanism to minimise perceptual distortion. Implemented in Python using NEST and realised on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA, SteganoSNN attains real-time operation with an embedding capacity of 8 bits per pixel. Experimental evaluations on the DIV2K 2017 dataset demonstrate image fidelity between 40.4 dB and 41.35 dB in PSNR and SSIM values consistently above 0.97, surpassing SteganoGAN in computational efficiency and robustness.

However, their reliability remains a challenge, especially in long-horizon tasks, since they often produce overconfident yet wrong outputs. Conformal Prediction (CP) has been leveraged to address this issue by wrapping LLM outputs into prediction sets that contain the correct action with a user-defined confidence. When the prediction set is a singleton, the planner executes that action; otherwise, it requests help from a user. This has led to LLM-based planners that can ensure plan correctness with a user-defined probability. However, as LLMs are trained in an uncertainty-agnostic manner, without awareness of prediction sets, they tend to produce unnecessarily large sets, particularly at higher confidence levels, resulting in frequent human interventions limiting autonomous deployment. To address this, we introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), the first CP-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that explicitly reduces prediction-set size and, in turn, the need for user interventions. We evaluate our approach on multiple language-instructed robot planning problems and show consistent improvements over uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic finetuning baselines in terms of prediction-set size, and help rates.

While recent large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong reasoning over complex audios, most operate on monaural inputs and lack the ability to capture spatial cues such as direction, elevation, and distance. We introduce SPUR, a lightweight, plug-in approach that equips LALMs with spatial perception through minimal architectural changes. SPUR consists of: (i) a First-Order Ambisonics (FOA) encoder that maps (W, X, Y, Z) channels to rotation-aware, listener-centric spatial features, integrated into target LALMs via a multimodal adapter; and (ii) SPUR-Set, a spatial QA dataset combining open-source FOA recordings with controlled simulations, emphasizing relative direction, elevation, distance, and overlap for supervised spatial reasoning.

To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions.

However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms.

The subtle distinguishing patterns, handling new species and the inherent open-set nature make the problem even harder. To address these complexities, foundation models trained on labeled, large-scale and multi-species animal Re-ID datasets have recently been introduced to enable zero-shot Re-ID. However, our benchmarking reveals significant gaps in their zero-shot Re-ID performance for both known and unknown species. While this highlights the need for collecting labeled data in new domains, exhaustive annotation for Re-ID is laborious and requires domain expertise. Our analyses show that existing unsupervised (USL) and AL Re-ID methods underperform for animal Re-ID. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to uncover and target structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space for mining pairs of samples that are both informative and broadly representative. Oracle feedback on these pairs, in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, facilitates a simple annotation interface, which naturally integrates with existing USL methods through our proposed constrained clustering refinement algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that, by utilizing only 0.033% of all annotations, our approach consistently outperforms existing foundational, USL and AL baselines. Specifically, we report an average improvement of 10.49%, 11.19% and 3.99% (mAP) on 13 wildlife datasets over foundational, USL and AL methods, respectively, while attaining state-of-the-art performance on each dataset.

To facilitate this task, we first present the Multimodal Multi-disease Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (M3DS) dataset, containing diverse multimodal multi-disease medical images paired with their corresponding segmentation masks and diagnosis chain-of-thought, created via an automated diagnosis chain-of-thought generation pipeline.

In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecdDelta\u81ea\u7136\u66f2\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u7528\u5168\u9690\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u5668DisMech\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Delta\u81ea\u7136\u66f2\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u5728\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u573a\u666f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u884c500\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u62df\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\u522b\u8fbe6\u500d\u548c40\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose an approximate method for legality checks. We propose a novel DL model for predicting the legality of transformations. The model takes the code representation and a list of transformations as input and predicts whether applying those transformations to the code is legal. We implement and evaluate the proposed model, demonstrating its effectiveness. Our evaluation shows an F1 score of 0.91 on a test set of randomly generated programs. To further evaluate the model in a practical scenario, we used the model to replace the legality check used during the training of an RL agent designed for automatic code optimization. We demonstrate that such a replacement enables the agent to train on twice as many steps, resulting in faster training and reducing resource usage by approximately 80\\% for CPU and 35\\% for RAM.

Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN)\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5019\u9009\u89e3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTSAN\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u8f6c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u952e\u503c\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u6743\u8861\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u5408\u6210\u65b0\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u7840SFT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4ec5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u6b21\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0cTSAN\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7Llama - 3.1 - 70B - Instruct\u7b49\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TSAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5019\u9009\u89e3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In a five-fold cross-validated evaluation on a public diffusion MRI database, our 3D LoRA fine-tuning strategy achieved state-of-the-art results, with one model variant reaching 71.9% accuracy and another attaining an AUC of 0.716. Both variants use only 1.64 million trainable parameters (over 113x fewer than a fully fine-tuned foundation model).

Quantifying these differences is critical to understanding if the quality of the legal information obtained by users of LLM-based chatbots varies depending on their location. However, obtaining meaningful comparative metrics is challenging because legal institutions in different places are not themselves easily comparable. In this work we propose a methodology to obtain place-to-place metrics based on the comparative law concept of functionalism. We construct a dataset of factual scenarios drawn from Reddit posts by users seeking legal advice for family, housing, employment, crime and traffic issues. We use these to elicit a summary of a law from the LLM relevant to each scenario in Los Angeles, London and Sydney. These summaries, typically of a legislative provision, are manually evaluated for hallucinations. We show that the rate of hallucination of legal information by leading closed-source LLMs is significantly associated with place. This suggests that the quality of legal solutions provided by these models is not evenly distributed across geography.

These approaches often over-rely on single, unreliable dynamic features, and are typically built on CNNs with limited receptive fields or Transformers with quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a new effective and scalable video mirror detection method, called MirrorMamba. Our approach leverages multiple cues to adapt to diverse conditions, incorporating perceived depth, correspondence and optical. We also introduce an innovative Mamba-based Multidirection Correspondence Extractor, which benefits from the global receptive field and linear complexity of the emerging Mamba spatial state model to effectively capture correspondence properties. Additionally, we design a Mamba-based layer-wise boundary enforcement decoder to resolve the unclear boundary caused by the blurred depth map.

Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy.

Their effectiveness highly depends on the specific nature of the task, especially the required domain knowledge. Existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts, typically operate at the task level; they are too coarse to effectively solve the heterogeneous problems involving multiple subjects. This work proposes a novel framework that performs fine-grained analysis at subject level equipped with a designated multi-agent collaboration strategy for addressing heterogeneous problem reasoning. Specifically, given an input query, we first employ a Graph Neural Network to identify the relevant subjects and infer their interdependencies to generate an \\textit{Subject-based Directed Acyclic Graph} (S-DAG), where nodes represent subjects and edges encode information flow. Then we profile the LLM models by assigning each model a subject-specific expertise score, and select the top-performing one for matching corresponding subject of the S-DAG. Such subject-model matching enables graph-structured multi-agent collaboration where information flows from the starting model to the ending model over S-DAG. We curate and release multi-subject subsets of standard benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, MedMCQA) to better reflect complex, real-world reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing task-level model selection and multi-agent collaboration baselines in accuracy and efficiency.

We identify this previously unexplained phenomenon as amplitude suppression, which we diagnose through analyzing training histories and loss landscapes. Three interacting factors emerge: S-wave onsets exhibit high temporal uncertainty relative to high-amplitude boundaries; CNN's bias toward sharp amplitude changes anchors predictions to these boundaries rather than subtle onsets; and point-wise Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss lacks lateral corrective forces, providing only vertical gradients that suppress amplitude while temporal gaps persist. This geometric trap points to a shape-then-align solution where stable geometric templates must precede temporal alignment. We implement this through a conditional GAN framework by augmenting conventional BCE training with a discriminator that enforces shape constraints.

However, a central challenge is the goal setting problem: robots must propose feasible and diverse goals that are achievable in their current environment. Existing methods like RIG (Visual Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Goals) use variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate goals in a learned latent space but have the limitation of producing physically implausible goals that hinder learning efficiency. We propose Physics-Informed RIG (PI-RIG), which integrates physical constraints directly into the VAE training process through a novel Enhanced Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder (Enhanced p3-VAE), enabling the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals. Our key innovation is the explicit separation of the latent space into physics variables governing object dynamics and environmental factors capturing visual appearance, while enforcing physical consistency through differential equation constraints and conservation laws. This enables the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals that respect fundamental physical principles such as object permanence, collision constraints, and dynamic feasibility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this physics-informed goal generation significantly improves the quality of proposed goals, leading to more effective exploration and better skill acquisition in visual robotic manipulation tasks including reaching, pushing, and pick-and-place scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPI - RIG\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPI - RIG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Enhanced p3 - VAE\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u6210\u5230VAE\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u6210\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63d0\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "conclusion": "PI - RIG\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Therefore, Spectral Deconvolution imaging (SDI) methods based on PSF engineering have been proposed to achieve high-fidelity compact CSI design recently. However, the composite convolution-integration operations of SDI render the normal-equation coefficient matrix scene-dependent, which hampers the efficient exploitation of imaging priors and poses challenges for accurate reconstruction. To tackle the inherent data-dependent operators in SDI, we introduce a Hierarchical Spatial-Spectral Aggregation Unfolding Framework (HSFAUF). By decomposing subproblems and projecting them into the frequency domain, HSFAUF transforms nonlinear processes into linear mappings, thereby enabling efficient solutions. Furthermore, to integrate spatial-spectral priors during iterative refinement, we propose a Spatial-Frequency Aggregation Transformer (SFAT), which explicitly aggregates information across spatial and frequency domains.

We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\\textit{capability curse}\" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment.

Applications like human action anticipation that require fusing multifarious sensor data are hindered by both feature and modality collapse. However, existing methods attempt to counter feature collapse and modality collapse separately. This is because there is no unifying framework that efficiently addresses feature and modality collapse in conjunction. In this paper, we posit the utility of effective rank as an informative measure that can be utilized to quantify and counter both the representation collapses. We propose \\textit{Rank-enhancing Token Fuser}, a theoretically grounded fusion framework that selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another modality. We show that our method increases the effective rank of the fused representation. To address modality collapse, we evaluate modality combinations that mutually increase each others' effective rank. We show that depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse. We validate our method on action anticipation, where we present \\texttt{R3D}, a depth-informed fusion framework.

Current shallow alignment methods that rely on direct refusal of malicious queries fail to provide robust protection, particularly against adversarial jailbreaks. While deliberative safety reasoning alignment offers deeper alignment for defending against sophisticated attacks, effectively implanting such reasoning capability in SLMs with limited capabilities remains an open challenge. Moreover, safety reasoning incurs significant computational overhead as models apply reasoning to nearly all queries, making it impractical for resource-constrained edge deployment scenarios that demand rapid responses. We propose EASE, a novel framework that enables practical and Efficient safety Alignment for Small languagE models. Our approach first identifies the optimal safety reasoning teacher that can effectively distill safety reasoning capabilities to SLMs. We then align models to selectively activate safety reasoning for dangerous adversarial jailbreak queries while providing direct responses to straightforward malicious queries and general helpful tasks. This selective mechanism enables small models to maintain robust safety guarantees against sophisticated attacks while preserving computational efficiency for benign interactions.

However, despite the analytical capabilities of platforms such as the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), their application remains largely confined to domain experts. Developing realistic simulation scenarios requires expertise in network construction, origin-destination modeling, and parameter configuration for policy experimentation, creating substantial barriers for non-expert users such as policymakers, urban planners, and city officials. Moreover, the requests expressed by these users are often incomplete and abstract-typically articulated as high-level objectives, which are not well aligned with the imperative, sequential workflows employed in existing language-model-based simulation frameworks. To address these challenges, this study proposes AgentSUMO, an agentic framework for interactive simulation scenario generation via large language models. AgentSUMO departs from imperative, command-driven execution by introducing an adaptive reasoning layer that interprets user intents, assesses task complexity, infers missing parameters, and formulates executable simulation plans. The framework is structured around two complementary components, the Interactive Planning Protocol, which governs reasoning and user interaction, and the Model Context Protocol, which manages standardized communication and orchestration among simulation tools. Through this design, AgentSUMO converts abstract policy objectives into executable simulation scenarios. Experiments on urban networks in Seoul and Manhattan demonstrate that the agentic workflow achieves substantial improvements in traffic flow metrics while maintaining accessibility for non-expert users, successfully bridging the gap between policy goals and executable simulation workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa AgentSUMO \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4eff\u771f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u5e94\u7528\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa AgentSUMO \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9996\u5c14\u548c\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u57ce\u5e02\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u4e5f\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentSUMO \u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that TiS-TSL exceeds other image-based state-of-the-arts by improving TEPE and EPE by at least 2.11% and 4.54%, respectively..", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTiS - TSL\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u521b\u5916\u79d1\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6559\u5e08 - \u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u521b\u5916\u79d1\u624b\u672f\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u4ec5\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u95ea\u70c1\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTiS - TSL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542b\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0cI2V\u9636\u6bb5\u8f6c\u79fb\u56fe\u50cf\u77e5\u8bc6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0cV2V\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba1\u7b97\u53cc\u5411\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTiS - TSL\u7684TEPE\u548cEPE\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u9ad82.11%\u548c4.54%\u3002", "conclusion": "TiS - TSL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce \\textbf{DA4ICL}, a demo-centric anchoring framework that jointly expands context width via \\emph{\\textbf{Diverse and Contrastive Retrieval}} (DCR) and deepens each demo's signal via \\emph{\\textbf{Projected Vector Anchoring}} (PVA) at every Transformer layer. Across three AD benchmarks, DA4ICL achieves large, stable gains over both ICL and TV baselines, charting a new paradigm for fine-grained, OOD and low-resource LLM adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDA4ICL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aAD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u65f6\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u8be5\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u5883\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u8bed\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDA4ICL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68c0\u7d22\u6269\u5c55\u8bed\u5883\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u5f71\u5411\u91cf\u951a\u5b9a\u6df1\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aAD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDA4ICL\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eICL\u548cTV\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "DA4ICL\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In a further main result of this work, which we refer to as \\emph{Adam symmetry theorem}, we illustrate the optimality of the established convergence rates by proving for a special class of simple quadratic strongly convex SOPs that Adam converges as the number of gradient steps increases to infinity to the solution of the SOP (the unique minimizer of the strongly convex objective function) if and \\emph{only} if the random variables in the SOP (the data in the SOP) are \\emph{symmetrically distributed}.

Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task.

To address this, we developed ET2dNet, a deep learning-based EPI-TIRF cross-modality network that achieves TIRF-comparable background subtraction and axial super-resolution from a single wide-field image without requiring hardware modifications. The model employs a physics-informed hybrid architecture, synergizing supervised learning with registered EPI-TIRF image pairs and self-supervised physical modeling via convolution with the point spread function. This framework ensures exceptional generalization across microscope objectives, enabling few-shot adaptation to new imaging setups. Rigorous validation on cellular and tissue samples confirms ET2dNet's superiority in background suppression and axial resolution enhancement, while maintaining compatibility with deconvolution techniques for lateral resolution improvement.

ET3dNet effectively removes out-of-focus background signals even when the input image stack lacks the source of background.

The architecture incorporates a cycle-length smoothing filter and confidence threshold to stabilize decisions. Results show that while several models achieved near-perfect offline accuracies (up to 99.9%), only the MLP sustained robust coverage (98-99%) under streaming, whereas ensembles preserved perfect anomaly precision but abstained frequently (10-49% coverage).

Its applications are vast; for instance, in imaging it can be used for learning data-adaptive regularizers and optimizing forward operators in variational regularization. These problems are large in many ways: a lot of data is usually available to train a large number of parameters, calling for stochastic gradient-based algorithms. However, exact gradients with respect to parameters (so-called hypergradients) are not available, and their precision is usually linearly related to computational cost. Hence, algorithms must solve the problem efficiently without unnecessary precision. The design of such methods is still not fully understood, especially regarding how accuracy requirements and step size schedules affect theoretical guarantees and practical performance. Existing approaches introduce stochasticity at both the upper level (e.g., in sampling or mini-batch estimates) and the lower level (e.g., in solving the inner problem) to improve generalization, but they typically fix the number of lower-level iterations, which conflicts with asymptotic convergence assumptions. In this work, we advance the theory of inexact stochastic bilevel optimization. We prove convergence and establish rates under decaying accuracy and step size schedules, showing that with optimal configurations convergence occurs at an $\\mathcal{O}(k^{-1/4})$ rate in expectation. Experiments on image denoising and inpainting with convex ridge regularizers and input-convex networks confirm our analysis: decreasing step sizes improve stability, accuracy scheduling is more critical than step size strategy, and adaptive preconditioning (e.g., Adam) further boosts performance. These results bridge theory and practice, providing convergence guarantees and practical guidance for large-scale imaging problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Specifically, the Hard Network is dedicated to handling \"Hard Source\" with higher transfer difficulty by aligning marginal distribution differences between source and target domains. Conversely, the Easy Network focuses on \"Easy Source\" with low transfer difficulty, utilizing a prototype classifier to model intra-class clustering structures while generating reliable pseudo-labels for the target domain through a prototype-guided label propagation algorithm. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, SEED and SEED-IV, demonstrate that HEDN achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-subject EEG emotion recognition, with average accuracies of 93.58\\% on SEED and 79.82\\% on SEED-IV, respectively.

However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process.

This algorithm provides solutions to Mean Field Game (MFG) or Mean Field Control (MFC) problems depending on the ratio between two learning rates: one for the value function and the other for the mean field term. In the MFC case, to rigorously identify the limit, we introduce a discretization of the state and action spaces, following the approach used in the finite-space case in [Angiuli et al., 2023b].

In this study, we introduce PlantTraitNet, a multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predictsfour key plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content) from citizen science photos using weak supervision. By aggregating individual trait predictions across space, we generate global maps of trait distributions. We validate these maps against independent vegetation survey data (sPlotOpen) and benchmark them against leading global trait products. Our results show that PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing trait maps across all evaluated traits, demonstrating that citizen science imagery, when integrated with computer vision and geospatial AI, enables not only scalable but also more accurate global trait mapping.

Under review", "summary": "The substantial memory bandwidth and computational demand of large language models (LLMs) present critical challenges for efficient inference. To tackle this, the literature has explored heterogeneous systems that combine neural processing units (NPUs) with DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) for LLM acceleration. However, existing high-precision (e.g., FP16) PIM compute units incur significant area and power overhead in DRAM technology, limiting the effective computation throughput. In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator co-design for P3-LLM, featuring lightweight compute units to support our hybrid numerical formats. The enhanced PIM compute units significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints. Third, we optimize the low-precision dataflow of different LLM modules by applying operator fusion to minimize the overhead of runtime dequantization. Our evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy in terms of both KV-cache-only quantization and weight-activation quantization. Combining the proposed quantization scheme with PIM architecture co-design, P3-LLM yields an average of $4.9\\times$, $2.0\\times$, and $3.4\\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art LLM accelerators HBM-PIM, Ecco, and Pimba, respectively.

However, most approaches rely on external annotations or heuristic-based segmentation to supervise model explanations, which can be noisy, imprecise and difficult to scale. In this work, we provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that low-quality supervision signals can degrade model performance rather than improve it. In response, we propose ALIGN, a novel framework that jointly trains a classifier and a masker in an iterative manner. The masker learns to produce soft, task-relevant masks that highlight informative regions, while the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment between its saliency maps and the learned masks. By leveraging high-quality masks as guidance, ALIGN improves both interpretability and generalizability, showing its superiority across various settings. Experiments on the two domain generalization benchmarks, VLCS and Terra Incognita, show that ALIGN consistently outperforms six strong baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.

A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon con- text, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain- agnostic way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22/\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d89\u53ca\u5b9e\u4f53\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5f53\u5b9e\u4f53\u6839\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89d2\u8272\u884c\u52a8\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22/\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u6807\u6ce8\u7b49\u6807\u51c6NER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u89d2\u8272\u4f5c\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u96c6\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u8868\u8bcd\u548c\u77ed\u8bed\u6784\u5efa\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ee5\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u4e2d\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u4e2d\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \\textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks.

One of the key issues pertains to limited real-world annotated data to facilitate generalizable models. The common practice to tackle this issue is to simulate new data. Although synthetic datasets offer scalability and perfect labels, their designer-crafted scenes fail to capture real-world complexity and sensor noise, resulting in a synthetic-to-real domain gap. Moreover, no benchmark provides synchronized real and simulated point clouds for segmentation-oriented domain shift analysis. We introduce TrueCity, the first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point clouds representing the same city. TrueCity proposes segmentation classes aligned with international 3D city modeling standards, enabling consistent evaluation of synthetic-to-real gap. Our extensive experiments on common baselines quantify domain shift and highlight strategies for exploiting synthetic data to enhance real-world 3D scene understanding.

However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.\n  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.\n  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language.

Accurate lesion detection remains challenging due to the need to identify multiple lesions of varying sizes. In this study, we investigate the effect of adding anatomy prior information to deep learning-based lesion detection models. In particular, we add organ segmentation masks from the TotalSegmentator tool as auxiliary inputs to provide anatomical context to nnDetection, which is the state-of-the-art for lesion detection, and Swin Transformer. The latter is trained in two stages that combine self-supervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. The method is tested in the AutoPET and Karolinska lymphoma datasets. The results indicate that the inclusion of anatomical priors substantially improves the detection performance within the nnDetection framework, while it has almost no impact on the performance of the vision transformer.

To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Rational Attention (SRA), a framework that explicitly aligns model attention with human rationales, improving both interpretability and fairness in hate speech classification. SRA integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers, optimizing a joint objective that combines standard classification loss with an alignment loss term that minimizes the discrepancy between attention weights and human-annotated rationales. We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics.

However, a significant limitation of current methods is their reliance on a pre-defined set of in-distribution (ID) ground-truth label names (positives). These fixed label names can be unavailable, unreliable at scale, or become less relevant due to in-distribution shifts after deployment. Towards truly unsupervised OOD detection, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining, bypassing the need for positives. In this paper, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining under a general concept mining paradigm. Within this framework, we propose ClusterMine, a novel positive label mining method. ClusterMine is the first method to achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without access to positive labels. It extracts positive concepts from a large text corpus by combining visual-only sample consistency (via clustering) and zero-shot image-text consistency. Our experimental study reveals that ClusterMine is scalable across a plethora of CLIP models and achieves state-of-the-art robustness to covariate in-distribution shifts.

Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques are leading solutions to improve computation fidelity with relatively low qubit-overhead, while full-scale quantum error correction remains a distant goal.

Focusing on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a widely adopted QEM technique, here we devise the surrogate-enabled ZNE (S-ZNE), which leverages classical learning surrogates to perform ZNE entirely on the classical side. Unlike conventional ZNE, whose measurement cost scales linearly with the number of circuits, S-ZNE requires only constant measurement overhead for an entire family of quantum circuits, offering superior scalability. Theoretical analysis indicates that S-ZNE achieves accuracy comparable to conventional ZNE in many practical scenarios, and numerical experiments on up to 100-qubit ground-state energy and quantum metrology tasks confirm its effectiveness.

However, malicious exploitation like voice-cloning fraud poses severe security risks. Existing defense techniques struggle to address the production large language model (LLM)-based speech synthesis. While previous studies have considered the protection for fine-tuning synthesizers, they assume manually annotated transcripts. Given the labor intensity of manual annotation, end-to-end (E2E) systems leveraging automatic speech recognition (ASR) to generate transcripts are becoming increasingly prevalent, e.g., voice cloning via commercial APIs. Therefore, this E2E speech synthesis also requires new security mechanisms. To tackle these challenges, we propose E2E-VGuard, a proactive defense framework for two emerging threats: (1) production LLM-based speech synthesis, and (2) the novel attack arising from ASR-driven E2E scenarios. Specifically, we employ the encoder ensemble with a feature extractor to protect timbre, while ASR-targeted adversarial examples disrupt pronunciation. Moreover, we incorporate the psychoacoustic model to ensure perturbative imperceptibility. For a comprehensive evaluation, we test 16 open-source synthesizers and 3 commercial APIs across Chinese and English datasets, confirming E2E-VGuard's effectiveness in timbre and pronunciation protection.

Vision-based gesture recognition suffers from high computational cost, sensitivity to lighting conditions, and privacy leakage concerns. Acoustic sensing provides an attractive alternative: by emitting inaudible high-frequency signals and capturing their reflections, channel impulse response (CIR) encodes how gestures perturb the acoustic field in a low-cost and user-transparent manner. However, existing CIR-based gesture recognition methods often rely on extensive training of models on large labeled datasets, making them unsuitable for few-shot VR scenarios. In this work, we propose the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for CIR-based gesture recognition in VR/AR systems. Despite LLMs' strengths, it is non-trivial to achieve few-shot and zero-shot learning of CIR gestures due to their inconspicuous features. To tackle this challenge, we collect differential CIR rather than original CIR data. Moreover, we construct a real-world dataset collected from 10 participants performing 15 gestures across three categories (digits, letters, and shapes), with 10 repetitions each. We then conduct extensive experiments on this dataset using an LLM-adopted classifier.

However, current research tends to focus narrowly on single-object prompts with limited contextual diversity. In reality, each object or attribute within a prompt can contribute to bias. For example, the prompt \"an assistant wearing a pink hat\" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink hat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations. Therefore, we introduce a bias adherence score that quantifies how specific object-attribute bindings activate bias. To delve deeper, we develop a training-free context-bias control framework to explore how token decoupling can facilitate the debiasing of semantic bindings. This framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Our analysis of bias scores across various attribute-object bindings and token decorrelation highlights a fundamental challenge: reducing bias without disrupting essential semantic relationships.

Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes.

Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data.

Factors such as tire characteristics, road surface conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and vehicle load make it infeasible to model real-world dynamics accurately, which hinders direct transfer of RL agents trained in simulation. In this paper, we present a framework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial and temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system. An RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to output continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a trajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle trajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At deployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal alignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for deviations between virtual and real trajectories. We validate our approach on a real vehicle and demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy enables robust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to reality, successfully decoupling high-level trajectory generation from low-level vehicle control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4ece\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u9ad8\u5c42\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u53ca\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u8026\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7528 Stanley \u63a7\u5236\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u6a2a\u5411\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u6301\u7eb5\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4ece\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u8026\u9ad8\u5c42\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4ece\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002"}}

This paper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this accuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and stealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign task-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an extremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than 1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully adapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the first demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation.

As collecting representative examples of all possible anomalies is infeasible, we tackle structural anomaly detection using a self-supervised autoencoder that learns to repair corrupted inputs. To this end, we introduce a corruption model that injects artificial disruptions into training images to mimic structural defects. While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in two key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\\ noise, we apply structured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of segmentation and inpainting.

In this paper, we reflect the main research achievements of MIR along the three EDICS related to music analysis, processing and generation. We then review a set of successful practices that fuel the rapid development of MIR research. One practice is the annual research benchmark, the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange, where participants compete on a set of research tasks. Another practice is the pursuit of reproducible and open research. The active engagement with industry research and products is another key factor for achieving large societal impacts and motivating younger generations of students to join the field.

In contrast, static data distributions often lead to vanishing learning signals when problems are either too easy or too hard for the policy. To implement RLVE, we create RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments carefully developed through manual environment engineering. Using RLVE-Gym, we show that environment scaling, i.e., expanding the collection of training environments, consistently improves generalizable reasoning capabilities. RLVE with joint training across all 400 environments in RLVE-Gym yields a 3.37% absolute average improvement across six reasoning benchmarks, starting from one of the strongest 1.5B reasoning LMs. By comparison, continuing this LM's original RL training yields only a 0.49% average absolute gain despite using over 3x more compute.

Effective LLM assistance hinges on selecting informative context -- the minimal set of cells whose code, data, or outputs suffice to answer a prompt.

They thus fail to curate appropriate contexts for LLM tasks, causing frustration and tedious prompt engineering.

In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7531\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7531\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5bf9\u5148\u8fdb\u5f00\u6e90\u53ca\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u524a\u5f31\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce the Walsh-Hadamard Neural Operator (WHNO), which leverages Walsh-Hadamard transforms-a spectral basis of rectangular wave functions naturally suited for piecewise constant fields-combined with learnable spectral weights that transform low-sequency Walsh coefficients to capture global dependencies efficiently. We validate WHNO on three problems: steady-state Darcy flow (preliminary validation), heat conduction with discontinuous thermal conductivity, and the 2D Burgers equation with discontinuous initial conditions. In controlled comparisons with Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) under identical conditions, WHNO demonstrates superior accuracy with better preservation of sharp solution features at material interfaces. Critically, we discover that weighted ensemble combinations of WHNO and FNO achieve substantial improvements over either model alone: for both heat conduction and Burgers equation, optimal ensembles reduce mean squared error by 35-40 percent and maximum error by up to 25 percent compared to individual models.

Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared applications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to the specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic infrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by providing large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level generative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to limited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples.

More specifically, we consider multiple ground base stations (GBSs) and each GBS has three different sectors/cells in the terrestrial networks, and multiple cells are turned off due to NES or incidents, e.g., disasters, hardware failures, or outages. To address this, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) framework to enable UAV-assisted communication by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, transmission power, and user-UAV association under a sleeping ground base station (GBS) strategy. This framework aims to ensure the resilience of active users in the network and the long-term operability of UAVs. Specifically, it maximizes service coverage for users during power outages or NES zones, while minimizing the energy consumption of UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG policy consistently achieves high coverage ratio across different testing episodes, outperforming other baselines. Moreover, the MADDPG framework attains the lowest total energy consumption, with a reduction of approximately 24\\% compared to the conventional all GBS ON configuration, while maintaining a comparable user service rate.

In our experiments, on mathematics, we observe that converting pretrained models to recurrent ones results in better performance at a given compute budget than simply post-training the original non-recurrent language model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f7f\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8bfe\u7a0b\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u539f\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In the last decade, a large body of work has emerged on local robustness, i.e., checking if the decision of a neural network remains unchanged when the input is slightly perturbed. However, many of these approaches require specialized encoding and often ignore the confidence of a neural network on its output. In this paper, our goal is to build a generalized framework to specify and verify variants of robustness in neural network verification. We propose a specification framework using a simple grammar, which is flexible enough to capture most existing variants. This allows us to introduce new variants of robustness that take into account the confidence of the neural network in its outputs. Next, we develop a novel and powerful unified technique to verify all such variants in a homogeneous way, viz., by adding a few additional layers to the neural network. This enables us to use any state-of-the-art neural network verification tool, without having to tinker with the encoding within, while incurring an approximation error that we show is bounded. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation over a large suite of 8870 benchmarks having 138M parameters in a largest network, and show that we are able to capture a wide set of robustness variants and outperform direct encoding approaches by a significant margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6307\u5b9a\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u89c4\u8303\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u7279\u6b8a\u7f16\u7801\u4e14\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u6307\u5b9a\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u5c42\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u76f4\u64ad\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053StreamDiffusionV2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027FPS\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76f4\u64ad\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u76f4\u64ad\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u64ad\u4e25\u683cSLOs\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d41\u591aGPU\u670d\u52a1\u95ee\u9898\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210SLO\u611f\u77e5\u6279\u5904\u7406\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u548c\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0b\u6c89\u4ee4\u724c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6eda\u52a8KV\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7ba1\u9053\u7f16\u6392\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aH100 GPU\u4e0a\uff0c14B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5e27\u6e32\u67d3\u57280.5s\u5185\uff0c\u8fbe\u523058.28 FPS\uff1b1.3B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523064.52 FPS\u3002", "conclusion": "StreamDiffusionV2\u8ba9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76f4\u64ad\u4ece\u4e2a\u4eba\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u5230\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5e73\u53f0\u90fd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards.

SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o.

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) aims to adapt a source-pretrained object detector to a target domain without access to source data. However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision.

Yet the calculation of $n$-RDMs is often computationally inefficient for strongly-correlated states, particularly when the system sizes are large. In this work, we propose to use neural network (NN) architectures to accelerate the calculation of, and even predict, the $n$-RDMs for large-size systems. The underlying intuition is that $n$-RDMs are often smooth functions over the Brillouin zone (BZ) (certainly true for gapped states) and are thus interpolable, allowing NNs trained on small-size $n$-RDMs to predict large-size ones. Building on this intuition, we devise two NNs: (i) a self-attention NN that maps random RDMs to physical ones, and (ii) a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) that directly maps momentum-space coordinates to RDM values. We test the NNs in three 2D models: the pair-pair correlation functions of the Richardson model of superconductivity, the translationally-invariant 1-RDM in a four-band model with short-range repulsion, and the translation-breaking 1-RDM in the half-filled Hubbard model. We find that a SIREN trained on a $6\\times 6$ momentum mesh can predict the $18\\times 18$ pair-pair correlation function with a relative accuracy of $0.839$. The NNs trained on $6\\times 6 \\sim 8\\times 8$ meshes can provide high-quality initial guesses for $50\\times 50$ translation-invariant Hartree-Fock (HF) and $30\\times 30$ fully translation-breaking-allowed HF, reducing the number of iterations required for convergence by up to $91.63\\%$ and $92.78\\%$, respectively, compared to random initializations.

The SAOP achieves high accuracy and success rates across 240 voice commands, while LLM-based agents improve robustness against speech recognition errors and diverse or ambiguous free-form commands, demonstrating strong potential to support minimally invasive da Vinci robotic surgery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u97f3\u5bfc\u5411\u7684SAOP\u5e73\u53f0\u7528\u4e8e\u8fbe\u82ac\u5947\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165MOEM\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e73\u53f0\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u652f\u6301\u624b\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fbe\u82ac\u5947\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4e2d\u65ad\u624b\u672f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u7684SAOP\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7531\u7f16\u6392\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u6210\uff1b\u5f15\u5165MOEM\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "SAOP\u5728240\u4e2a\u8bed\u97f3\u547d\u4ee4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SAOP\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u652f\u6301\u8fbe\u82ac\u5947\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u3002"}}

Yet, how to effectively use these models for closed-loop symbolic planning remains largely unexplored. Because they operate as black boxes, LLMs and VLMs can produce unpredictable or costly errors, making their use in high-level robotic planning especially challenging. In this work, we investigate how to use VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners for robotic applications from a control-theoretic perspective. Concretely, we study how the control horizon and warm-starting impact the performance of VLM symbolic planners. We design and conduct controlled experiments to gain insights that are broadly applicable to utilizing VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners, and we discuss recommendations that can help improve the performance of VLM symbolic planners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u5229\u7528VLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u95ed\u73af\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63a7\u5236\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u5bf9\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u548cVLMs\u7528\u4e8e\u95ed\u73af\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5c06VLMs\u7528\u4f5c\u95ed\u73af\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8VLM\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Recent video generation models can synthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and images, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for robotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to robots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld substantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.
