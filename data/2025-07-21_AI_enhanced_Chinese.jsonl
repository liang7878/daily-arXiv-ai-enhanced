While reinforcement learning (RL) offers\na promising direction, existing approaches are inefficient as they fail to\ncapture the structured, hierarchical nature of the problem. We argue that\nHierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), a paradigm that has been successful\nin other domains, provides a conceptually ideal yet previously unexplored\nframework for this task. However, a naive HRL implementation with a `hard\nhierarchy' is prone to suboptimal, irreversible decisions. To address this, we\nintroduce CogniQ-H, the first framework to implement a soft hierarchical\nparadigm for robust, end-to-end automated data preparation. CogniQ-H formulates\naction selection as a Bayesian inference problem. A high-level strategic prior,\ngenerated by a Large Language Model (LLM), guides exploration\nprobabilistically.

The traditional\napproach to checkpointing requires a pause in training to copy model states to\na separate location, allowing the state to be restored in the event of failure.\nThis approach fundamentally has a tradeoff between the frequency of checkpoints\nand the cost of a failure. We avoid this tradeoff; our key insight is that in\ndata-parallel training, all information necessary to create a checkpoint\nalready exists in the network as gradients. Our core contribution is a new\nmulticast abstraction that simultaneously delivers gradients to a separate\nCPU-based shadow cluster. The shadow maintains a checkpoint by applying those\ngradients to a copy of the model. Our evaluation shows that Checkmate performs\nper-iteration checkpointing with training throughput comparable to an ideal\nno-checkpoint baseline.

However,\nexisting Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their\ninability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In\nthis work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph\nretrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over\ntemporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal\nambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units\n(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal\nanchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture\ntemporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event\ngraph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting\nefficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent\ngeneration, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that\nretrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time\nChain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This\nunified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event\nsequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG\nsystems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of\nthree typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more\nfaithful and temporal-aware generation.

Naive centralized algorithms\nrun BFS/DFS from each source in $O(m \\cdot n^{\\sigma})$ time or compute $G$'s\ntransitive closure in $\\hat O(n^{\\omega})$ time, where $\\omega \\le\n2.371552\\ldots$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. Thus, the best known\nbound is $\\hat O(n^{\\min \\{ 2 + \\sigma, \\omega\\}})$. Leveraging shortcut\nconstructions by Kogan and Parter [SODA 2022, ICALP 2022], we develop a\ncentralized algorithm with running time $\\hat O(n^{1 + \\frac{2}{3}\n\\omega(\\sigma)})$, where $\\omega(\\sigma)$ is the rectangular matrix\nmultiplication exponent.

We significantly\nimprove, extend, and generalize Cohen's result. First, our parallel algorithm\nfor graphs with small recursive separators has lower work complexity than\nCohen's in boraod paramater ranges.

Despite their instructional relevance, these samples are\noften governed informally, with minimal review and unclear ownership, which\nincreases their exposure to socio-technical degradation. In this context, the\nco-occurrence and longitudinal interplay of code smells (e.g., large classes,\npoor modularity) and community smells (e.g., lone contributors, fragmented\ncommunication) become particularly critical. While each type of smell has been\nstudied in isolation, little is known about how community-level dysfunctions\nanticipate or exacerbate technical anomalies in code samples over time. This\nstudy investigates how code and community smells emerge, co-occur, and evolve\nwithin code samples maintained in OSSECOs. A Multivocal Literature Review\nprotocol was applied, encompassing 30 peer-reviewed papers and 17\npractitioner-oriented sources (2013-2024). Thematic synthesis was conducted to\nidentify recurring socio-technical patterns related to smell dynamics. Nine\npatterns were identified, showing that community smells often precede or\nreinforce technical degradation in code samples. Symptoms such as \"radio\nsilence\" and centralized ownership were frequently associated with persistent\nstructural anomalies. Additionally, limited onboarding, the absence of\ncontinuous refactoring, and informal collaboration emerged as recurring\nconditions for smell accumulation. Conclusion: In OSSECOs, particularly within\ncode samples, community-level dysfunctions not only correlate with but often\nsignal maintainability decay.

Our work provides three core contributions to\nachieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse\nIntersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for\npluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives\nthrough a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who\nprovided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,\ncapturing nuanced safety perceptions.

Behavioral science studies suggest\nthat screen-based news reading contains three successive steps: scanning, title\nreading, and then clicking. Adhering to these steps, we find that intra-news\nentity interest dominates the scanning stage, while the inter-news entity\ninterest guides title reading and influences click decisions. Unfortunately,\ncurrent methods overlook the unique utility of entities in news recommendation.\nTo this end, we propose a novel method called IP2 to probe entity-guided\nreading interest at both intra- and inter-news levels. At the intra-news level,\na Transformer-based entity encoder is devised to aggregate mentioned entities\nin the news title into one signature entity. Then, a signature entity-title\ncontrastive pre-training is adopted to initialize entities with proper meanings\nusing the news story context, which in the meantime facilitates us to probe for\nintra-news entity interest. As for the inter-news level, a dual tower user\nencoder is presented to capture inter-news reading interest from both the title\nmeaning and entity sides. In addition to highlighting the contribution of\ninter-news entity guidance, a cross-tower attention link is adopted to\ncalibrate title reading interest using inter-news entity interest, thus further\naligning with real-world behavior.

The evolutionary process successfully balanced between\nquality of of the final solutions and neural architecture search effectiveness.\nOverall, our findings suggest that the proposed MorphoNAS method is able to\ngrow complex specific neural architectures, using simple developmental rules,\nwhich suggests a feasible biological route to adaptive and efficient neural\narchitecture search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMorphoNAS\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u89c4\u5219\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u89c4\u5219\u4ece\u7d27\u51d1\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u53d1\u80b2\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u591a\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MorphoNAS\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u539f\u7406\u3001\u53cd\u5e94 - \u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u56e0\u8c03\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u53d1\u751f\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5730\u751f\u957f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7f16\u7801\u5f62\u6001\u53d1\u751f\u7d20\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7ec6\u80de\u53d1\u80b2\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u751f\u6210\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6210\u529f\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\uff1b\u5728CartPole\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MorphoNAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u53d1\u80b2\u89c4\u5219\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5b9a\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Feature requests,\ntypically expressed in natural language, often suffer from ambiguity or\nincomplete information due to communication gaps or the requester's limited\ntechnical expertise. These issues can lead to misinterpretation, faulty\nimplementation, and reduced software quality. While seeking clarification from\nrequesters is a common strategy to mitigate these risks, little is known about\nhow developers engage in this clarification process in practice-how they\nformulate clarifying questions, seek technical or contextual details, align on\ngoals and use cases, or decide to close requests without attempting\nclarification. This study investigates how feature requests are prone to NL\ndefects (i.e. ambiguous or incomplete) and the conversational dynamics of\nclarification in open-source software (OSS) development, aiming to understand\nhow developers handle ambiguous or incomplete feature requests. Our findings\nsuggest that feature requests published on the OSS platforms do possess\nambiguity and incompleteness, and in some cases, both. We also find that\nexplicit clarification for the resolution of these defects is uncommon;\ndevelopers usually focus on aligning with project goals rather than resolving\nunclear text. When clarification occurs, it emphasizes understanding user\nintent/goal and feasibility, rather than technical details.

The second contribution is a structured research agenda that,\nstarting from the identified issues, introduces important directions for future\nwork related to multistakeholder design, context awareness, data collection,\ntrustworthiness, novel interactions, and real-world evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba8\u8bbaPOI\u63a8\u8350\u95ee\u9898\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "POI\u63a8\u8350\u867d\u6709\u4f17\u591a\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u8ba8\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9POI\u63a8\u8350\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u627e\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u51faPOI\u63a8\u8350\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5047\u8bbe\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u3001\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u504f\u5dee\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u591a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u65b0\u9896\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This paper attempts to address this problem by exploring two\ncomplementary aspects.\n  First, it proposes a framework for comparing existing test methods in terms\nof their intrinsic effectiveness and validity. It shows that many methods do\nnot meet both of these requirements. Either because they are based on criteria\nthat do not allow for rapid, inexpensive, and comprehensive detection of\nfailures, or because the degree of validity of the properties tested cannot be\naccurately estimated. In particular, it is shown that most critical test\nmethods do not take into account the nominal operational capabilities of\nautopilots and generate scenarios that are impossible for the tested vehicles\nto handle, resulting in unjustified rejections.\n  Secondly, the paper shows that test effectiveness and validity are highly\ndependent on how autopilots are designed: how they choose between different\ncontrol policies to perform maneuvers, as well as on the reproducibility of the\nresults. In fact, most test methods take for granted two principles underlying\ntraditional methods, but do not generally apply to ADS. We maintain that the\nabsence of rationality and determinacy significantly impairs the effectiveness\nand validity of test methods, and provide test results on eight open\nautopilots, in which most do not satisfy these properties, thereby illustrating\nthis fact.\n  We conclude that under the current state of the art, it is impossible to\nobtain strong enough guarantees for essential autopilot properties and\nrecommend that autopilots be developed with a view to both rationality and\ndeterminacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u96be\u83b7\u8db3\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5f00\u53d1\u517c\u987e\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u516b\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bb8\u591a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u672a\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u540d\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u5f00\u6e90\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6280\u672f\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,\ngenerating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named\nQuery Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the\ncentral task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the\nrise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method\nto increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is\nstill a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and\ntrustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have\nno control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already\nincluded in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that\nevaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a\nnatural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL\ngeneration, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with \"anonymized\" knowledge\ninjection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of\nthe training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will\nhelp to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly\nbe achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.\nLLM memorization).

The\nnetwork is designed to map from the local wall geometry to the Riesz\nrepresentors for the corresponding local flow averages. With such a\nparameterisation, the network only depends on the local wall geometry and as\nsuch can be trained independent of boundary conditions.

We consider two natural sparsity objectives: minimizing the maximum\nout-degree and minimizing the total size.\n  We first show a strong negative result: the slow-preprocessing version of\nDiskANN (analyzed in [IX23] for low-doubling metrics) can yield solutions whose\nsparsity is $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(n)$ times larger than optimal, even on\nEuclidean instances. We then show a tight approximation-preserving equivalence\nbetween the Sparsest Navigable Graph problem and the classic Set Cover problem,\nobtaining an $O(n^3)$-time $(\\ln n + 1)$-approximation algorithm, as well as\nestablishing NP-hardness of achieving an $o(\\ln n)$-approximation. Building on\nthis equivalence, we develop faster $O(\\ln n)$-approximation algorithms.

We analyze its performance in a\nshared-memory parallel setting: for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$, it runs in\ntime $\\widetilde{O}\\left(L_{\\max}+n\\right)$, where $n$ is the number of\nvertices and $L_{\\max}$ is the maximum stream length. It supports\n$O\\left(1\\right)$ per-edge processing time using $\\widetilde{O}\\left(k\\cdot\nn\\right)$ space. We further generalize the design to hierarchical\narchitectures, in which $k$ processors are partitioned into $r$ groups, each\nwith its own shared local memory. The total intergroup communication is\n$\\widetilde{O}\\left(r \\cdot n\\right)$ bits, while all other performance\nguarantees are preserved.\n  We evaluate the algorithm on a shared-memory system using graphs with\ntrillions of edges. It achieves substantial speedups as $k$ increases and\nproduces matchings with weights significantly exceeding the theoretical\nguarantee. On our largest test graph, it reduces runtime by nearly two orders\nof magnitude and memory usage by five orders of magnitude compared to an\noffline algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5355\u904d\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u5927\u6743\u91cd\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u8282\u7701\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6d41\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u5927\u6743\u91cd\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5355\u904d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u6743\u91cd\u8d85\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u5927\u6743\u91cd\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While existing Temporal Graph Neural\nNetworks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex\narchitectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer\nfrom scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.\nIn this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates\nshort-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns.

Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge.

Recent\nstudies have shown that ICL can surpass the original meaning learned in\npretraining stage through internalizing the structure the data-generating\nprocess (DGP) of the prompt into the hidden representations. However, the\nmechanisms by which LLMs achieve this ability is left open. In this paper, we\npresent the first rigorous explanation of such phenomena by introducing a\nunified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge\nboth over context and across layers. This double convergence process leads to\nan implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove\nanalytically and verify empirically.

However, their unpredictability,\ncombined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous\nevaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems\ndid well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not\nin brevity.\n  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to\nadapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting\ntheir deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3e\u529ePLABA\u8d5b\u9053\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u8f6c\u901a\u4fd7\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u81ea\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u8f6c\u901a\u4fd7\u8bed\u8a00\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3e\u529e\u8d5b\u9053\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u57282023\u548c2024\u5e74\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e3e\u529ePLABA\u8d5b\u9053\uff0c\u8bbe\u4e24\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a11\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u53d1\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\uff0c\u4e24\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u5747\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "12\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb612\u652f\u961f\u4f0d\u53c2\u8d5b\uff0c\u4efb\u52a11\u9876\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u5224\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u4efb\u52a12\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u96be\u8bcd\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u66ff\u6362\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u66ff\u6362\u65f6\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "PLABA\u8d5b\u9053\u663e\u793a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4e5f\u51f8\u663e\u5176\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u81ea\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Running a Transformer\nautoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and,\nmore recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback\nloops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in\nsubsequent steps. While this \"thinking aloud\" mirrors human reasoning,\nbiological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as\nlanguage. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without\nresorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an\nencoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed\npoint. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes\nthe input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix\ninternally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This\nadaptivity yields up to 20\\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without\nincreasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test\ntime offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget.\nSelf-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative\nreasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSELF - Transformer\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7801\u5668Transformer\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u5355\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u2018\u5927\u58f0\u601d\u8003\u2019\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u7269\u5927\u8111\u8fed\u4ee3\u65e0\u9700\u5c06\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56token\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u7801\u5668Transformer\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SELF - Transformer\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u5c06\u81ea\u8eab\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u5230\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u98ce\u683c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe20%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SELF - Transformer\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7eaf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos\nfrom three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation\nspace that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse\ndynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from\ngenerated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can\neffectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that\nwith only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only\n1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and\nbackgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art\nmethods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,\ncoupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable\nrobotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVIDAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5177\u8eab\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVIDAR\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728750K\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u52a8\u4f5c\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u752820\u5206\u949f\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\uff08\u5178\u578b\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u76841%\uff09\uff0cVIDAR\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4e0a\u6709\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u63a9\u7801\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6837\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002"}}

We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies\nand find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step\nbefore the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's\noriginal performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on\nscene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning\naccuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune\nmodels using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and\nevaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates\nsuperior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,\nwe find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade\nperformance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from \"closer to\" to \"farther\nfrom\"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable\nperformance under such shifts.

However, its impact on generalization under\nsubstantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely\nunexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different\nadversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and\nadversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model\narchitectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an\ninherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach\nis evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This\nbenchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training\nand test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a\ncommon real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial\ntraining strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the\nclassification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks\ndesigned to maximize embedding dissimilarity. These attack types are also used\nfor robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses\nthe stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks.\nResults show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space\nattacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative\nand simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models.

However, the generation of training\ndatasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a\ncomputational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare\nevents or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation\nmodels that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular\ndatabases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data\nnecessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach\nrequires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can\nstill be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events\nand for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning.\nIn on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely\nautomated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the\nmodel is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with\nclassical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying\nthis form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to\nassess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even\nthough most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In\nthis paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach\nbased on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow\nthat automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified\naccuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them\nat an increased rate relative to their occurrence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u521b\u5efa\u5408\u9002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u5408\u9002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bbe\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5982\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\u7b49\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u542b\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We propose IConMark, a novel\nin-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable\nconcepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable\nwatermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or\nperturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic\nattributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to\nadversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image\naugmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of\nwatermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,\ndemonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining\nimage quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking\ntechniques to further enhance and complement its robustness.

We address this gap\nthrough a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a\nmulti-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.\nArchitectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and\nRF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level\nensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW\nensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming\nindividual models across all key metrics.

While existing SC harmonization methods -\nsuch as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate\nthese biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or\noverlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a\nsite-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across\ndiverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a\nsimulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this\nframework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected\nautoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a\ntop-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight\nprediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior\npreservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as\nreflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively.

Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,\nrevealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,\npersisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within\nthis idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other\nsources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid\nadaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to\ninvestigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual\nlearning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating\nconcurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to\nmodulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native\nmultitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam\nintroduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.\nInspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently\nenhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we\npropose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that\napproximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of\nknowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We\nevaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of\nthe MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that\nuncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.\nFinally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic\nfunctions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing\nstability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u5927\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5f31\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u673a\u7406\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u6096\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7f13\u89e3\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u534f\u8c03\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u84dd\u6591\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u53bb\u7532\u80be\u4e0a\u817a\u7d20\u7206\u53d1\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53cc\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u548cCIFAR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u57df\u589e\u91cf\u548c\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5f31\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u76ca\u8c03\u5236\u590d\u5236\u4e86\u76ae\u8d28\u56de\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u53bb\u7532\u80be\u4e0a\u817a\u7d20\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u7406\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning\nand in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful\ndesign choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for\nstructured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented\nDiffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the\neditability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through\ntwo core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion\n(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines\nstandard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy\ninput from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative\nand compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and\nstructure-aware editing.

Our\nframework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal\ntrainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.\nExtensive experiments on CUB-200, \\emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that\nDiffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on\npreviously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDiffusion - FSCIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51bb\u7ed3\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u6269\u6563\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u9632\u6b62\u751f\u6210\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u9aa8\u5e72\u3001\u6700\u5c11\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u6279\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728CUB - 200\u3001miniImageNet\u548cCIFAR - 100\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDiffusion - FSCIL\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Diffusion - FSCIL\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u3002"}}

While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal\nconnectivity and biophysics, a significant gap remains in how these elements\ncombine to produce flexible, learned behaviors. Here, we propose that a\nframework based on State-Space Models (SSMs), an emerging class of deep\nlearning architectures, can bridge this gap. We argue that the differential\nequations governing elements in an SSM are conceptually consistent with the\nbiophysical dynamics of neurons, while the combined dynamics in the model lead\nto emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this\nframework by training an S5 model--a specific SSM variant employing a diagonal\nstate transition matrix--on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement\nlearning (RL). We demonstrate that the model spontaneously develops neural\nrepresentations that strikingly mimic biological 'time cells'. We reveal that\nthese cells emerge from a simple generative principle: learned rotational\ndynamics of hidden state vectors in the complex plane. This single mechanism\nunifies the emergence of time cells, ramping activity, and\noscillations/traveling waves observed in numerous experiments. Furthermore, we\nshow that this rotational dynamics generalizes beyond interval discriminative\ntasks to abstract event-counting tasks that were considered foundational for\nperforming complex cognitive tasks.

Unlike conventional methods\nthat rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more\nrobust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.\nComprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our\napproach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and\n3D scene completion accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCF - SSC\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76eeSSC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u548c\u89c6\u91ce\u5916\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76eeSSC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u906e\u6321\u548c\u89c6\u91ce\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCF - SSC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f2a\u672a\u6765\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u6269\u5927\u611f\u77e5\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5efa\u7acb3D\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fc7\u53bb\u3001\u73b0\u5728\u548c\u672a\u6765\u5e27\u76843D\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u91c7\u75283D\u611f\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728SemanticKITTI\u548cSSCBench - KITTI - 360\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u906e\u6321\u63a8\u7406\u548c3D\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

To enhance the\ndiscriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image\ndescriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and\nedge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an\nimage. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is\nused to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid\nsearch. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,\nincluding Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers\ncompetitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.\nOur results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a\ncompact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive\nand limited interpretable deep learning models.

Our approach\nemploys evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding\nthe extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression\nmechanism that maintains spatial diversity.

While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage\ncurrently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to\ntrain them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea\nof No\\`e et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating\nparallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper\npresents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to\ntrain QBMs in a supervised setting.

Possessing awareness of event memorability for a\nuser could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially\nfor such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and\nmeeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since\nemotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The\nemotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally\nbeen considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced\nas highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This\nrelationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for\nmemorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on\nthird-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person\nexperience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study,\nwe empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions\n(Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational\ninteractions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of\nboth emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings,\napproximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as\nonline meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship\nbetween affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished\nfrom what might be expected under random chance.
