### [1] [When Truthful Representations Flip Under Deceptive Instructions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22149)
*Xianxuan Long,Yao Fu,Runchao Li,Mu Sheng,Haotian Yu,Xiaotian Han,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型在欺骗性与真实/中性指令下内部表征变化，发现可通过线性探针预测输出，欺骗指令导致显著表征偏移，识别出敏感特征和不同表征子空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型易按恶意指令生成欺骗性回复，需了解欺骗指令相比真实指令如何改变模型内部表征。

Method: 分析Llama - 3.1 - 8B - Instruct和Gemma - 2 - 9B - Instruct在事实验证任务中的内部表征，用线性探针预测输出，用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）研究表征变化。

Result: 模型指令的真假输出可基于内部表征通过线性探针预测；欺骗指令相比真实/中性指令导致显著表征偏移，集中在中早期层，复杂数据集也可检测；识别出对欺骗指令高度敏感的SAE特征，证实不同的真假表征子空间。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了欺骗的特征和层级别特征，为检测和缓解大语言模型的欺骗行为提供新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions
to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive
instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful
ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we
investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful
to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing
the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct
on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False
output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the
internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show
that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts
compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated
in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also
identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and
use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive
representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and
feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM
detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures
of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed
dishonesty in LLMs.

### [2] [Explainability Through Systematicity: The Hard Systematicity Challenge for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22197)
*Matthieu Queloz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨AI的系统性概念，提出概念框架区分其四种含义，化解系统性与联结主义的矛盾，识别五种系统化理由并引出‘硬系统性挑战’，提出动态理解系统化需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨可解释性只是塑造我们对AI期望的更广泛理想的一个方面，核心是AI在多大程度上展现系统性。

Method: 提出概念框架区分‘思维系统性’的四种含义，识别五种系统化的理由并应用于AI。

Result: 化解了系统性与联结主义的矛盾，引出‘硬系统性挑战’。

Conclusion: 对思想系统化的需求需要由系统化的理由来调节，从而产生对AI模型系统性需求的动态理解。

Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal
that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).
Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not
merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable
constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is
consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer
conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the
"systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network
architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed
"the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking
about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the
phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between
systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity
that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,
authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To
determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of
systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization
and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such
rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity
challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be
regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic
understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic
we need AI models to be and when.

### [3] [CoEx -- Co-evolving World-model and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22281)
*Minsoo Kim,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有LLM智能体规划依赖静态世界模型易出错，提出分层架构CoEx，实验表明其在规划和探索方面优于现有范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体设计未能有效将新观察融入世界模型动态更新，依赖静态模型易与真实世界状态不一致，导致规划错误。

Method: 引入分层架构CoEx，利用分层状态抽象使LLM规划与动态更新的世界模型共同进化，通过LLM推理编排子目标组成的动态计划，学习机制将子目标经验融入神经符号信念状态形式的持久世界模型。

Result: 在包括ALFWorld、PDDL和Jericho等丰富环境和复杂任务的多种场景中进行评估，实验显示CoEx在规划和探索方面优于现有智能体范式。

Conclusion: CoEx这种分层架构能有效解决现有LLM智能体规划依赖静态世界模型的问题，提升规划和探索能力。

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal
world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail
to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world
model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively
prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to
the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical
agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM
planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans
and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic
plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously
incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the
form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and
code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent
scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld,
PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent
paradigms in planning and exploration.

### [4] [An Explainable Emotion Alignment Framework for LLM-Empowered Agent in Metaverse Service Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22326)

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and
service systems, designed to address service-related challenges concerning
digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the
rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in
Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars
representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs)
providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse
service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in
bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly
regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge
association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable
emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service
Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop
of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more
relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in
the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

### [5] [Nearest-Better Network for Visualizing and Analyzing Combinatorial Optimization Problems: A Unified Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22440)
*Yiya Diao,Changhe Li,Sanyou Zeng,Xinye Cai,Wenjian Luo,Shengxiang Yang,Carlos A. Coello Coello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对NBN计算耗时问题给出高效计算方法，并将其应用于OneMax和TSP问题，有新发现并指出TSP算法局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NBN计算耗时且扩展到组合优化问题有挑战，需解决计算问题并用于分析算法行为。

Method: 给出NBN本质为算法最大概率转移网络的理论推导，提出对数线性时间复杂度的高效NBN计算方法。

Result: 发现OneMax适应度景观有中性、崎岖性和模态特征；TSP问题主要挑战是崎岖性、模态和欺骗性；EAX和LKH两种TSP算法分别在应对模态和欺骗性挑战时有局限。

Conclusion: 高效NBN算法可用于分析优化问题景观特征和算法局限性。

Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled
data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape
features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the
extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging
but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides
a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network
essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for
algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with
logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By
applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the
first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,
and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,
modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and
LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and
deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there
are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single
population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple
attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins
simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to
algorithm's stagnation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前大语言模型驱动的AI代理有局限和安全风险，提出Magentic - UI用于人机交互研究，经多维度评估，显示其促进人机协作的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理在多数领域未达人类水平且存在安全风险，需结合人类监督控制与AI效率提升生产力。

Method: 引入开源Web界面Magentic - UI，基于多代理架构，支持多种操作，通过MCP扩展工具，提供六种交互机制，并从四个维度评估。

Result: 评估发现Magentic - UI有潜力推动安全高效的人机协作。

Conclusion: Magentic - UI为开发和研究人机交互提供有效途径，能促进安全高效的人机协作。

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of
autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet,
they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and
ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security
risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We
argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward,
combining human oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity
from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface
for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible
multi-agent architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution,
and file manipulation, and can be extended with diverse tools via Model Context
Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking,
multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI
across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks,
simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies
with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight
Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent
collaboration.

### [7] [LLM-Crowdsourced: A Benchmark-Free Paradigm for Mutual Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22359)
*Qianhong Guo,Wei Xie,Xiaofang Cai,Enze Wang,Shuoyoucheng Ma,Kai Chen,Xiaofeng Wang,Baosheng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型评估方法有问题，提出LLM - Crowdsourced评估范式，实验验证其优势并发现新现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型评估方法存在数据污染、黑盒操作和主观偏好等问题，难以全面评估模型真实能力。

Method: 提出基准无关的评估范式LLM - Crowdsourced，利用大语言模型生成问题、独立回答和相互评估，集成动态、透明、客观和专业四个评估标准。

Result: 在数学和编程领域对八个主流大语言模型的实验验证了该方法在区分模型性能上的优势，还发现了一些传统方法难以检测的新现象。

Conclusion: LLM - Crowdsourced评估范式有效，能弥补现有评估方法的不足。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task.
Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination,
black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult
to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,
LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,
and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:
dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation
methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs
across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in
distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel
findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but
not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional
question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit
''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones
with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high
consistency (robustness).

### [8] [Beyond Accuracy: How AI Metacognitive Sensitivity improves AI-assisted Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22365)
*ZhaoBin Li,Mark Steyvers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文强调AI元认知敏感性在混合决策中的作用，分析其与预测准确性的联合影响，实验证实其能提升人类决策表现，强调应兼顾评估二者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人类依赖AI决策场景中，明确AI预测准确性和置信估计可靠性对决策质量的影响，探究元认知敏感性的作用。

Method: 提出理论框架分析AI预测准确性和元认知敏感性的联合影响，进行行为实验验证。

Result: 发现低预测准确性但高元认知敏感性的AI可提升人类决策整体准确性，实验证实更高元认知敏感性改善人类决策表现。

Conclusion: 评估AI辅助时应兼顾准确性和元认知敏感性，优化二者以获更好决策结果。

Abstract: In settings where human decision-making relies on AI input, both the
predictive accuracy of the AI system and the reliability of its confidence
estimates influence decision quality. We highlight the role of AI metacognitive
sensitivity -- its ability to assign confidence scores that accurately
distinguish correct from incorrect predictions -- and introduce a theoretical
framework for assessing the joint impact of AI's predictive accuracy and
metacognitive sensitivity in hybrid decision-making settings. Our analysis
identifies conditions under which an AI with lower predictive accuracy but
higher metacognitive sensitivity can enhance the overall accuracy of human
decision making. Finally, a behavioral experiment confirms that greater AI
metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance. Together, these
findings underscore the importance of evaluating AI assistance not only by
accuracy but also by metacognitive sensitivity, and of optimizing both to
achieve superior decision outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程化AGI需要以物种无关形式捕捉智能本质，且该形式要可评估、具通用性。

Method: 提出基于样本保真度的通用标准，将其形式化为ε - 类别智能。

Result: 给出了形式化框架，概述了实证协议。

Conclusion: 讨论了该标准在评估、安全和泛化方面的影响。

Abstract: To engineer AGI, we should first capture the essence of intelligence in a
species-agnostic form that can be evaluated, while being sufficiently general
to encompass diverse paradigms of intelligent behavior, including reinforcement
learning, generative models, classification, analogical reasoning, and
goal-directed decision-making. We propose a general criterion based on sample
fidelity: intelligence is the ability, given sample(s) from a category, to
generate sample(s) from the same category. We formalise this intuition as
{\epsilon}-category intelligence: it is {\epsilon}-intelligent with respect to
a category if no chosen admissible distinguisher can separate generated from
original samples beyond tolerance {\epsilon}. We present the formal framework,
outline empirical protocols, and discuss implications for evaluation, safety,
and generalization.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the legal compliance challenges of autonomous vehicles
in a transnational context. We choose the perspective of designers and try to
provide supporting legal reasoning in the design process. Based on
argumentation theory, we introduce a logic to represent the basic properties of
argument-based practical (normative) reasoning, combined with partial order
sets of natural numbers to express priority. Finally, through case analysis of
legal texts, we show how the reasoning system we provide can help designers to
adapt their design solutions more flexibly in the cross-border application of
autonomous vehicles and to more easily understand the legal implications of
their decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疫情后医疗需求激增和护士短缺，当前AI分诊系统存在不足，需创新解决方案。

Method: 采用RecipientAgent、InquirerAgent和DepartmentAgent三个专业智能体，通过结构化询问机制和特定科室指导规则；构建中文医疗分诊数据集，用大语言模型进行数据插补。

Result: 多智能体系统在四轮患者交互后，一级科室分类准确率达89.2%，二级科室分类准确率达73.9%，能适应不同医院配置。

Conclusion: 工作提供可扩展框架，能适应医疗机构组织异质性，确保临床决策合理。

Abstract: The post-pandemic surge in healthcare demand, coupled with critical nursing
shortages, has placed unprecedented pressure on emergency department triage
systems, necessitating innovative AI-driven solutions. We present a multi-agent
interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three
fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: insufficient medical
specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications,
heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and
inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions.
Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent,
and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms
and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient
symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation,
we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical
website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and
62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large
language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records
in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent
system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9%
accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient
interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable
efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high
triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying
AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational
heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound
decision-making.

Motivation: 现有人类设计的多智能体框架局限于预定义场景，当前自动设计方法存在缺乏工具集成、依赖外部训练数据和通信结构僵化等问题。

Result: 生成的多智能体系统优于其他自动设计方法，能达到与针对特定任务优化的人工设计系统相当的性能。

Conclusion: MetaAgent框架在多智能体系统自动设计方面表现良好，具有一定优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve a wide
range of practical tasks within multi-agent systems. However, existing
human-designed multi-agent frameworks are typically limited to a small set of
pre-defined scenarios, while current automated design methods suffer from
several limitations, such as the lack of tool integration, dependence on
external training data, and rigid communication structures. In this paper, we
propose MetaAgent, a finite state machine based framework that can
automatically generate a multi-agent system. Given a task description,
MetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an
optimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite
state machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To
evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and
practical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system
surpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance
with the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those
specific tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文评估用大语言模型（LLMs）从知识图谱（KGs）检索信息的策略，聚焦制造业，发现提供合适KG架构上下文能提升LLMs生成查询的性能，有望促进复杂数据仓库的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KGs在制造业数据管理中有用，但非专家使用需复杂SPARQL查询，LLMs虽有潜力将自然语言转为SPARQL，但需解决告知特定领域KG上下文以提高查询准确性的问题。

Method: 评估用LLMs作为中介从KGs检索信息的多种策略，比较向LLMs提供KG相关上下文的不同方法，分析将现实问题转为SPARQL查询的能力。

Result: 仅提供KG架构的适当上下文时，LLMs生成正确完整查询的性能显著提高，上下文感知提示技术可让LLMs关注本体相关部分并减少幻觉风险。

Conclusion: 所提出的技术有助于LLMs使复杂数据仓库的访问更普及，促进制造业的明智决策。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the
manufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data
sources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing
the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires
formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to
automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus
bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated
architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about
the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in
manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we
evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate
information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,
particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core
Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding
relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in
transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that
LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and
complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such
context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of
the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the
proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data
repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.

Conclusion: asp - fzn性能很有前景，在普通ASP上有竞争力，在部分CASP基准测试中表现更好。

Abstract: We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP),
which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating
CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports
several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our
solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common
global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with
state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions.
Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and
compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that
supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very
promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms
clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

Motivation: 提升合作环境中多智能体的协作能力。

Method: 提出TAAC算法，采用集中训练/集中执行方案，结合多头注意力机制，引入惩罚损失函数。

Result: 在模拟足球环境中与其他基准算法对比，TAAC在多种指标上表现出优越性能和更强协作行为。

Conclusion: TAAC算法能有效提升多智能体协作能力，管理联合动作空间。

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement
learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative
environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme
incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic.
This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to
explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth
of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We
further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet
complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer
environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent
paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent
Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and
enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal
differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial
distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession
swaps).

Motivation: 现代SAT求解器架构复杂，自动配置框架依赖手动约束搜索空间，性能提升有限，需新优化方法。

Method: 提出开发模块化求解器的系统指南，引入无监督自动提示优化方法，设计预搜索策略和EA进化算法。

Result: AutoModSAT比基线求解器性能提升50%，比SOTA求解器优越30%，比参数调优的SOTA求解器平均提速20%。

Conclusion: 本工作弥合了AI启发式发现与关键系统优化的差距，为下一代复杂求解器开发提供方法进步和实证结果。

Abstract: Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computational complexity
with broad industrial applications, and it remains challenging to optimize
modern SAT solvers in real-world settings due to their intricate architectures.
While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on
manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This
work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT
solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is
developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve
superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are
proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,
emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)
Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization
method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient
search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary
algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that
AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and
achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,
AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned
alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in
handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven
heuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides
both methodological advancements and empirically validated results for
next-generation complex solver development.

TL;DR: 本文介绍用于可压缩流模拟的高阶数值框架，提出宏单元HDG方法提升效率，扩展方法增强鲁棒性，经测试有良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准混合间断伽辽金（HDG）方法在大规模场景中的低效率问题，增强在欠分辨率或湍流状态下的鲁棒性。

Method: 开发宏单元HDG方法，通过在宏单元内嵌入连续伽辽金结构减少自由度；用熵变量和通量差分方法扩展以构建熵稳定和动能守恒变体。

Result: 在基准问题上验证了最优精度、改进的鲁棒性，比标准HDG方法提速达一个数量级。

Conclusion: 这些进展是可压缩流直接数值模拟高阶方法的重大进步。

Abstract: This paper introduces a high order numerical framework for efficient and
robust simulation of compressible flows. To address the inefficiencies of
standard hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods in large scale
settings, we develop a macro element HDG method that reduces global and local
degrees of freedom by embedding continuous Galerkin structure within
macro-elements. This formulation supports matrix free implementations and
enables highly parallel local solves, leading to substantial performance gains
and excellent scalability on modern architectures. To enhance robustness in
under resolved or turbulent regimes, we extend the method using entropy
variables and a flux differencing approach to construct entropy stable and
kinetic energy preserving variants. These formulations satisfy a discrete
entropy inequality and improve stability without compromising high order
accuracy. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on benchmark
problems including the inviscid isentropic vortex and the Taylor Green vortex
in both inviscid and turbulent regimes. Numerical results confirm optimal
accuracy, improved robustness, and up to an order of magnitude speedup over
standard HDG methods. These developments mark a significant advancement in high
order methods for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of compressible flows.

Abstract: For centuries, financial institutions have responded to liquidity challenges
by forming closed, centralized clearing clubs with strict rules and membership
that allow them to collaborate on using the least money to discharge the most
debt. As closed clubs, much of the general public has been excluded from
participation. But the vast majority of private sector actors consists of micro
or small firms that are vulnerable to late payments and generally ineligible
for bank loans. This low liquidity environment often results in gridlock and
leads to insolvency, and it disproportionately impacts small enterprises and
communities.
  On the other hand, blockchain communities have developed open, decentralized
settlement systems, along with a proliferation of store of value assets and new
lending protocols, allowing anyone to permissionlessly transact and access
credit. However, these protocols remain used primarily for speculative
purposes, and so far have fallen short of the large-scale positive impact on
the real economy prophesied by their promoters.
  We address these challenges by introducing Cycles, an open, decentralized
clearing, settlement, and issuance protocol. Cycles is designed to enable firms
to overcome payment inefficiencies, to reduce their working capital costs, and
to leverage diverse assets and liquidity sources, including cryptocurrencies,
stablecoins, and lending protocols, in service of clearing more debt with less
money. Cycles solves real world liquidity challenges through a
privacy-preserving multilateral settlement platform based on a graph
optimization algorithm. The design is based on a core insight: liquidity
resides within cycles in the payment network's structure and can be accessed
via settlement flows optimized to reduce debt.

Result: PIHKAN以更低的模型复杂度实现更高精度；拓展了PIHNNs适用的方程类型；解决了之前仅适用于单连通几何的局限。

Conclusion: 改进和拓展了PIHNNs在二维问题中的应用。

Abstract: Physics-informed holomorphic neural networks (PIHNNs) have recently emerged
as efficient surrogate models for solving differential problems. By embedding
the underlying problem structure into the network, PIHNNs require training only
to satisfy boundary conditions, often resulting in significantly improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs). In this work, we improve and extend the application of
PIHNNs to two-dimensional problems. First, we introduce a novel holomorphic
network architecture based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation (PIHKAN),
which achieves higher accuracy with reduced model complexity. Second, we
develop mathematical extensions that broaden the applicability of PIHNNs to a
wider class of elliptic partial differential equations, including the Helmholtz
equation. Finally, we propose a new method based on Laurent series theory that
enables the application of holomorphic networks to multiply-connected plane
domains, thereby removing the previous limitation to simply-connected
geometries.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for performance-driven
structural design that combines bottom-up design generation with learned
strategies to efficiently search large combinatorial design spaces. Motivated
by the limitations of conventional top-down approaches such as optimization,
the framework instead models structures as compositions of predefined elements,
aligning form finding with practical constraints like constructability and
component reuse. With the formulation of the design task as a sequential
decision-making problem and a human learning inspired training algorithm, the
method adapts reinforcement learning for structural design. The framework is
demonstrated by designing steel braced truss frame cantilever structures, where
trained policies consistently generate distinct, high-performing designs that
display structural performance and material efficiency with the use of
structural strategies that align with known engineering principles. Further
analysis shows that the agent efficiently narrows its search to promising
regions of the design space, revealing transferable structural knowledge.

Abstract: Computational modelling offers a cost-effective and time-efficient
alternative to experimental studies in biomedical engineering. In cardiac
electro-mechanics, finite element method (FEM)-based simulations provide
valuable insights into diseased tissue behaviour and the development of
assistive systems such as di-electric elastomer actuators. However, the use of
automatically generated tetrahedral meshes, commonly applied due to geometric
complexity, often leads to numerical issues including overly stiff responses
and volume locking, particularly in incompressible materials. Smoothed finite
element methods (S-FEMs) offer a promising alternative by softening the
stiffness matrix through gradient smoothing over defined smoothing domains.
This work extends S-FEM formulations to electro-mechanically coupled problems
and compares their performance against standard linear FEM. We implement and
evaluate four approaches in the Abaqus environment via custom user elements:
standard linear FEM, face-based S-FEM (FS-FEM), node-based S-FEM (NS-FEM), and
the hybrid face/node-based S-FEM (FSNS-FEM). Two benchmark problems are
studied: the electrically induced contraction of a compressible dielectric
elastomer and an incompressible, orthotropic myocardial tissue sample.
Reference solutions are obtained using a mesh consisting of higher-order
elements. Our results demonstrate that FSNS-FEM provides the best balance
between accuracy and computational efficiency, closely matching reference data.
NS-FEM produces softer results, which leads to an overestimation of the true
deformation. FS-FEM and standard FEM consistently exhibit overly stiff
behaviour, with pronounced volume locking in the myocardial case. These
findings support the potential of S-FEMs, in particular FSNS-FEM, for accurate
simulation of coupled electro-mechanical behaviour in complex biomedical
applications.

Conclusion: 提出的新框架能自动准确确定牙冠边缘线，且提供了训练和测试数据集。

Abstract: Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or
missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are
carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a
preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually
define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a
non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework
to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A
dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to
train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was
modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth
into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary
faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to
train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their
results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and
optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation
results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to
represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the
centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that
an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest
number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance
threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground
truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the
preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth
margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide
the train and test datasets for the community.

Conclusion: 提出并分析了四种图查询结果的紧凑表示方法，为解决相关问题提供思路。

Abstract: We study path-based graph queries that, in addition to navigation through
edges, also perform navigation through time. This allows asking questions about
the dynamics of networks, like traffic movement, cause-effect relationships, or
the spread of a disease. In this setting, a graph consists of triples annotated
with validity intervals, and a query produces pairs of nodes where each pair is
associated with a binary relation over time. For instance, such a pair could be
two airports, and the temporal relation could map potential departure times to
possible arrival times. An open question is how to represent such a relation in
a compact form and maintain this property during query evaluation. We
investigate four compact representations of answers to a such queries, which
are based on alternative ways to encode sets of intervals. We discuss their
respective advantages and drawbacks, in terms of conciseness, uniqueness, and
computational cost. Notably, the most refined encoding guarantees that query
answers over dense time can be finitely represented.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱缺乏强制模式，存在数据质量问题，现有工作未全面覆盖数据质量维度，因此研究SHACL用于评估知识图谱数据质量。

Method: 为Zaveri等人提出的69个数据质量指标定义SHACL形状，实现自动实例化这些形状并从验证结果计算数据质量指标的原型。

Result: 实现了原型并在https://github.com/caroocortes/SHACL - DQA - prototype/tree/main提供资源。

Conclusion: SHACL可用于评估知识图谱的数据质量，且提供了可重复的研究资源。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have been widely adopted in both enterprises, such as the
Google Knowledge Graph, and open platforms like Wikidata to represent domain
knowledge and support analysis with artificial intelligence. They model
real-world information as nodes and edges. To embrace flexibility, knowledge
graphs often lack enforced schemas (i.e., ontologies), leading to potential
data quality issues, such as semantically overlapping nodes. Therefore,
ensuring their quality is essential, as issues in the data can affect
applications relying on them. To assess the quality of knowledge graphs,
existing works either propose high-level frameworks comprising various data
quality dimensions without concrete implementations, define tools that measure
data quality with ad-hoc SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)
queries, or promote the usage of constraint languages, such as the Shapes
Constraint Language (SHACL), to assess and improve the quality of the graph.
Although the latter approaches claim to address data quality assessment, none
of them comprehensively tries to cover all data quality dimensions. In this
paper, we explore this gap by investigating the extent to which SHACL can be
used to assess data quality in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we defined SHACL
shapes for 69 data quality metrics proposed by Zaveri et al. [1] and
implemented a prototype that automatically instantiates these shapes and
computes the corresponding data quality measures from their validation results.

Conclusion: QuranResearch.Org系统可服务于伊斯兰数据库系统，具备可伸缩性、可用性、可复现性和可扩展性。

Abstract: With the widespread of software systems and applications that serve the
Islamic knowledge domain, several concerns arise. Authenticity and accuracy of
the databases that back up these systems are questionable. With the excitement
that some software developers and amateur researchers may have, false
statements and incorrect claims may be made around numerical signs or miracles
in the Quran. Reproducibility of these claims may not be addressed by the
people making such claims. Moreover, with the increase in the number of users,
scalability and availability of these systems become a concern. In addition to
all these concerns, extensibility is also another major issue. Properly
designed systems can be extensible, reusable and built on top of one another,
instead of each system being built from scratch every time a new framework is
developed. In this paper, we introduce the QuranResearch.Org system and its
vision for scalability, availability, reproducibility and extensibility to
serve Islamic database systems.

Conclusion: 所提出的系统方法能有效评估知识图谱修复质量，特定提示策略可提升修复系统性能。

Abstract: We present a systematic approach for evaluating the quality of knowledge
graph repairs with respect to constraint violations defined in shapes
constraint language (SHACL). Current evaluation methods rely on \emph{ad hoc}
datasets, which limits the rigorous analysis of repair systems in more general
settings. Our method addresses this gap by systematically generating violations
using a novel mechanism, termed violation-inducing operations (VIOs). We use
the proposed evaluation framework to assess a range of repair systems which we
build using large language models. We analyze the performance of these systems
across different prompting strategies. Results indicate that concise prompts
containing both the relevant violated SHACL constraints and key contextual
information from the knowledge graph yield the best performance.

Result: 在7个数据集评估，查询质量至少与静态构建索引相当，在内存场景百万级数据集有7 - 1200x吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: CleANN是首个在全动态下保持质量并实现高效的并发ANNS索引。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) has become a quintessential
algorithmic problem for various other foundational data tasks for AI workloads.
Graph-based ANNS indexes have superb empirical trade-offs in indexing cost,
query efficiency, and query approximation quality. Most existing graph-based
indexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the
data after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,
deletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in
applications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently
supports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based
indexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query
quality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to
maintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve
these problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main
components: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to
combat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood
consolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory
cleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the
work spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse
datasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at
least as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding
data. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of
queries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x
throughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, CleANN is the first concurrent ANNS index to achieve such efficiency
while maintaining quality under full dynamism.

Method: 提出AURA算法，合成H因子（历史稳定效率）和V因子（未来改进边际收益），通过自适应权重控制双因子模型。

Conclusion: 有原则的、注重稳定性的设计对现实世界大规模系统持续高性能至关重要。

Abstract: The co-location of multiple database instances on resource constrained edge
nodes creates significant cache contention, where traditional schemes are
inefficient and unstable under dynamic workloads. To address this, we present
SAM, an autonomic cache manager powered by our novel AURA algorithm. AURA makes
stability a first-class design principle by resolving the
exploitation-exploration dilemma: it achieves this by synthesizing two
orthogonal factors, which we introduce as: the H-factor, representing a
database's proven, historically stable efficiency (exploitation), and the
V-factor, representing its empirically estimated marginal gain for future
improvements (exploration). This dual-factor model, governed by an adaptive
weight, enables SAM to achieve sustained high performance through strategic
stability and robustness in volatile conditions.
  Extensive experiments against 14 diverse baselines demonstrate SAM's
superiority. It achieves top-tier throughput while being uniquely resilient to
complex workload shifts and cache pollution attacks. Furthermore, its decision
latency is highly scalable, remaining nearly constant as the system grows to
120 databases. Crucially, SAM achieves superior decision stability --
maintaining consistent optimization directions despite noise, avoiding
performance oscillations while ensuring predictable Quality of Service. These
results prove that a principled, stability-aware design is essential for
sustained high performance in real-world, large-scale systems.

### [30] [Minimizing CGYRO HPC Communication Costs in Ensembles with XGYRO by Sharing the Collisional Constant Tensor Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22245)
*Igor Sfiligoi,Emily A. Belli,Jeff Candy*

TL;DR: 开发新工具XGYRO执行CGYRO模拟集合，通过共享碰撞常数张量结构节省内存和降低通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 第一性原理聚变等离子体模拟计算和内存需求大，单个CGYRO模拟通信开销高，而聚变研究多由模拟集合组成，需优化。

Method: 开发XGYRO工具，将CGYRO模拟集合作为一个整体处理，改变全局缓冲区分配逻辑。

Result: 通过共享碰撞常数张量结构，大幅节省每个模拟的内存，降低通信开销。

Conclusion: XGYRO工具能有效优化CGYRO模拟集合的内存使用和通信开销。

Abstract: First-principles fusion plasma simulations are both compute and memory
intensive, and CGYRO is no exception. The use of many HPC nodes to fit the
problem in the available memory thus results in significant communication
overhead, which is hard to avoid for any single simulation. That said, most
fusion studies are composed of ensembles of simulations, so we developed a new
tool, named XGYRO, that executes a whole ensemble of CGYRO simulations as a
single HPC job. By treating the ensemble as a unit, XGYRO can alter the global
buffer distribution logic and apply optimizations that are not feasible on any
single simulation, but only on the ensemble as a whole. The main saving comes
from the sharing of the collisional constant tensor structure, since its values
are typically identical between parameter-sweep simulations. This data
structure dominates the memory consumption of CGYRO simulations, so
distributing it among the whole ensemble results in drastic memory savings for
each simulation, which in turn results in overall lower communication overhead.

have been tested across various scientific applications, including conduction
cloudmask, earthquake prediction, simulation-AI/ML interactions, and the
development of computational fluid dynamics surrogates.

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are emerging as key components of 6G
networks, with many already deployed to support large-scale Earth observation
and sensing related tasks. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising
paradigm for enabling distributed intelligence in these resource-constrained
and dynamic environments. However, achieving reliable convergence, while
minimizing both processing time and energy consumption, remains a substantial
challenge, particularly in heterogeneous and partially unlabeled satellite
networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel semi-supervised
federated learning framework tailored for LEO satellite networks with
hierarchical clustering aggregation. To further reduce communication overhead,
we integrate sparsification and adaptive weight quantization techniques. In
addition, we divide the FL clustering into two stages: satellite cluster
aggregation stage and Ground Stations (GSs) aggregation stage. The supervised
learning at GSs guides selected Parameter Server (PS) satellites, which in turn
support fully unlabeled satellites during the federated training process.
Extensive experiments conducted on a satellite network testbed demonstrate that
our proposal can significantly reduce processing time (up to 3x) and energy
consumption (up to 4x) compared to other comparative methods while maintaining
model accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce ``communication regions'' into the widely used Caliper HPC

something not previously possible in Caliper. We explore the utility of
communication regions with three representative modeling and simulation
applications, AMG2023, Kripke, and Laghos, all part of the comprehensive
Benchpark suite that includes Caliper annotations. Enhanced Caliper reveals
detailed communication behaviors. Using Caliper and Thicket in tandem, we
create new visualizations of MPI communication patterns, including halo
exchanges. Our findings reveal communication bottlenecks and detailed
behaviors, indicating significant utility of the special-regions addition to
Caliper. The comparative scaling behavior of both CPU and GPU oriented systems
are shown; we are able to look at different regions within a given application,

Abstract: Edge Storage Systems have emerged as a critical enabler of low latency data
access in modern cloud networks by bringing storage and computation closer to
end users. However, the limited storage capacity of edge servers poses
significant challenges in handling high volume and latency sensitive data
access requests, particularly under dynamic workloads. In this work, we propose
a profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are
collaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike
traditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy,
allowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded
blocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and
public regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points
based on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data
locality and ownership. We design a data placement and replacement policy that
determines how and where to store or evict coded data blocks to maximize data
access within deadlines. While the private region serves requests from local
APs, the public region handles cooperative storage requests from neighboring
servers. Our proposed Dynamic Space Partitioning and Elastic caching strategy
is evaluated on both synthetic and real world traces from Netflix and Spotify.
Experimental results show that our method improves overall system profitability
by approximately 5 to 8% compared to state of the art approaches under varied
workload conditions.

Result: 得到一般图近似比为2+2W/w，树的近似比为1+W/w。

Conclusion: 成功给出树和一般图上加权令牌交换问题的首个近似算法及紧障碍结果。

Abstract: We study the weighted token swapping problem, in which we are given a graph
on $n$ vertices, $n$ weighted tokens, an initial assignment of one token to
each vertex, and a final assignment of one token to each vertex. The goal is to
find a minimum-cost sequence of swaps of adjacent tokens to reach the final
assignment from the initial assignment, where the cost is the sum over all
swaps of the sum of the weights of the two swapped tokens. Unweighted token
swapping has been extensively studied: it is NP-hard to approximate to a factor
better than $14/13$, and there is a polynomial-time 4-approximation, along with
a tight "barrier" result showing that the class of locally optimal algorithms
cannot achieve a ratio better than 4. For trees, the problem remains NP-hard to
solve exactly, and there is a polynomial-time 2-approximation, along with a
tight barrier result showing that the class of $\ell$-straying algorithms
cannot achieve a ratio better than 2. Weighted token swapping with $\{0,1\}$
weights is much harder to approximation: it is NP-hard to approximate even to a
factor of $(1-\varepsilon) \cdot \ln n$ for any constant $\varepsilon>0$.
Restricting to positive weights, no approximation algorithms are known, and the
only known lower bounds are those inherited directly from the unweighted
version. We provide the first approximation algorithms for weighted token
swapping on both trees and general graphs, along with tight barrier results.
Letting $w$ and $W$ be the minimum and maximum token weights, our approximation
ratio is $2+2W/w$ for general graphs and $1+W/w$ for trees.

Method: 提出两种正交的宽松并发FIFO队列设计，一种源自MultiQueue，另一种基于环形缓冲区，并在多种微基准测试和大图的广度优先搜索应用中评估。

Result: 两种设计均优于现有宽松和严格FIFO队列，实现更高吞吐量和更好可扩展性。

Conclusion: 所提出的两种宽松并发FIFO队列设计有效，能提升队列性能。

Abstract: FIFO queues are a fundamental data structure used in a wide range of
applications. Concurrent FIFO queues allow multiple execution threads to access
the queue simultaneously. Maintaining strict FIFO semantics in concurrent
queues leads to low throughput due to high contention at the head and tail of
the queue. By relaxing the FIFO semantics to allow some reordering of elements,
it becomes possible to achieve much higher scalability. This work presents two
orthogonal designs for relaxed concurrent FIFO queues, one derived from the
MultiQueue and the other based on ring buffers. We evaluate both designs
extensively on various micro-benchmarks and a breadth-first search application
on large graphs. Both designs outperform state-of-the-art relaxed and strict
FIFO queues, achieving higher throughput and better scalability.

Abstract: The Colonel Blotto game, formulated by Emile Borel, involves players
allocating limited resources to multiple battlefields simultaneously, with the
winner being the one who allocates more resources to each battlefield.
Computation of the Nash equilibrium, including of two person, zero sum, mixed
strategy Colonel Blotto games have encountered issues of scalability and
complexity owing to their PPAD completeness. This paper proposes an algorithm
that computes the same value as the Nash equilibrium but cannot be
characterized by the Fixed point Theorems of Tarski, Kakutani and Brouwer. The
reduced complexity of the proposed algorithm is based on dispensing with the
need for computing both players Nash strategies in Colonel Blotto games. The
same algorithm can, therefore, be extended to all two person, zero sum games to
compute the value of the Nash equilibrium. The theoretical superiority of the
proposed algorithm over both LP solvers and another method that computes the
same value of the game as its Nash equilibrium by a random assignment of
probabilities to the active strategy set of the defending player, is also
proposed.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling buyer intent is a foundational challenge in
optimizing search query reformulation within the dynamic landscape of
e-commerce search systems. This work introduces a robust data pipeline designed
to mine and analyze large-scale buyer query logs, with a focus on extracting
fine-grained intent signals from both explicit interactions and implicit
behavioral cues. Leveraging advanced sequence mining techniques and supervised
learning models, the pipeline systematically captures patterns indicative of
latent purchase intent, enabling the construction of a high-fidelity,
intent-rich dataset. The proposed framework facilitates the development of
adaptive query rewrite strategies by grounding reformulations in inferred user
intent rather than surface-level lexical signals. This alignment between query
rewriting and underlying user objectives enhances both retrieval relevance and
downstream engagement metrics. Empirical evaluations across multiple product
verticals demonstrate measurable gains in precision-oriented relevance metrics,
underscoring the efficacy of intent-aware reformulation. Our findings highlight
the value of intent-centric modeling in bridging the gap between sparse user
inputs and complex product discovery goals, and establish a scalable foundation
for future research in user-aligned neural retrieval and ranking systems.

Conclusion: GRID框架具有实用价值，开源平台有助于生成式推荐研究的基准测试和推进。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) has gained increasing attention for its
promising performance compared to traditional models. A key factor contributing
to the success of GR is the semantic ID (SID), which converts continuous
semantic representations (e.g., from large language models) into discrete ID
sequences. This enables GR models with SIDs to both incorporate semantic
information and learn collaborative filtering signals, while retaining the
benefits of discrete decoding. However, varied modeling techniques,
hyper-parameters, and experimental setups in existing literature make direct
comparisons between GR proposals challenging. Furthermore, the absence of an
open-source, unified framework hinders systematic benchmarking and extension,
slowing model iteration. To address this challenge, our work introduces and
open-sources a framework for Generative Recommendation with semantic ID, namely
GRID, specifically designed for modularity to facilitate easy component
swapping and accelerate idea iteration. Using GRID, we systematically
experiment with and ablate different components of GR models with SIDs on
public benchmarks. Our comprehensive experiments with GRID reveal that many
overlooked architectural components in GR models with SIDs substantially impact
performance. This offers both novel insights and validates the utility of an
open-source platform for robust benchmarking and GR research advancement. GRID
is open-sourced at https://github.com/snap-research/GRID.

Conclusion: MMSC框架能有效解决现有方法面临的问题，在商品推荐任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce a novel self-supervised multi-modal relational item
representation learning framework designed to infer substitutable and
complementary items. Existing approaches primarily focus on modeling item-item
associations deduced from user behaviors using graph neural networks (GNNs) or
leveraging item content information. However, these methods often overlook
critical challenges, such as noisy user behavior data and data sparsity due to
the long-tailed distribution of these behaviors. In this paper, we propose
MMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning
framework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three
main components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that
leverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a
self-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and
learns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation
aggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic
and task levels. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to generate augmented training
data, further enhancing the denoising process during training. We conduct
extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, showing that MMSC
outperforms existing baselines by 26.1% for substitutable recommendation and
39.2% for complementary recommendation. In addition, we empirically show that
MMSC is effective in modeling cold-start items.

Abstract: Detecting, analyzing, and predicting power outages is crucial for grid risk
assessment and disaster mitigation. Numerous outages occur each year,
exacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data
are typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution
and making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers
excellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image
data provides significantly higher spatial resolution and enables a more
comprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing
the geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events.
However, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating
spatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge
representation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and
predictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal
knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including nighttime light
satellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and
county-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for
constructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology,
GeoOutageOnto. Currently, GeoOutageKG includes over 10.6 million individual
outage records spanning from 2014 to 2024, 300,000 NTL images spanning from
2012 to 2024, and 15,000 outage maps. GeoOutageKG is a novel, modular and
reusable semantic resource that enables robust multimodal data integration. We
demonstrate its use through multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power
outages.

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型、以意图为中心的设计能促进更可持续和互利的推荐生态系统。

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful applications of artificial
intelligence, serving as critical infrastructure connecting users, merchants,
and platforms. However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant
on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e.,
optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent.
This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical
preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a
result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately
harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole
recommendation ecosystem.
  To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of
recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places
user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large
language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval,
and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into
an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the
above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a
multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced
pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative
judge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App.
Online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance
gains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and
satisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions.
These comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that
LLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually
beneficial recommendation ecosystem.

TL;DR: 本文提出跨模态对抗攻击框架AUV - Fusion，结合用户交互数据和视觉扰动，在多数据集上评估显示其能提升目标物品曝光且具高隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉感知推荐系统（VARS）对抗攻击的鲁棒性研究不足，现有攻击策略有局限性。

Method: 提出AUV - Fusion框架，通过多跳用户 - 物品交互获取用户嵌入，经MLP转换为语义对齐扰动，注入扩散模型中预训练VAE的潜在空间。

Result: 在不同VARS架构和真实数据集上，AUV - Fusion比传统基线方法显著提升目标（冷启动）物品曝光，且隐蔽性好。

Conclusion: AUV - Fusion有效解决了现有攻击策略的问题，能增强目标物品曝光并保持高隐蔽性。

Abstract: Modern Visual-Aware Recommender Systems (VARS) exploit the integration of
user interaction data and visual features to deliver personalized
recommendations with high precision. However, their robustness against
adversarial attacks remains largely underexplored, posing significant risks to
system reliability and security. Existing attack strategies suffer from notable
limitations: shilling attacks are costly and detectable, and visual-only
perturbations often fail to align with user preferences. To address these
challenges, we propose AUV-Fusion, a cross-modal adversarial attack framework
that adopts high-order user preference modeling and cross-modal adversary
generation. Specifically, we obtain robust user embeddings through multi-hop
user-item interactions and transform them via an MLP into semantically aligned
perturbations. These perturbations are injected onto the latent space of a
pre-trained VAE within the diffusion model. By synergistically integrating
genuine user interaction data with visually plausible perturbations, AUV-Fusion
eliminates the need for injecting fake user profiles and effectively mitigates
the challenge of insufficient user preference extraction inherent in
traditional visual-only attacks. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse VARS
architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate that AUV-Fusion significantly
enhances the exposure of target (cold-start) items compared to conventional
baseline methods. Moreover, AUV-Fusion maintains exceptional stealth under
rigorous scrutiny.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统核心模型依赖敏感用户 - 物品交互数据，但现实中隐私保护不足，且缺乏判断敏感交互的方法，需量化隐私风险以实现隐私感知的模型开发和部署。

Method: 提出基于成员推理攻击（MIA）的隐私评分方法RecPS，从交互层面扩展到用户层面，核心是交互层面的MIA方法RecLiRA。

Result: 在知名基准数据集和推荐系统模型上进行了大量实验。

Conclusion: RecPS评分在风险评估和推荐系统模型遗忘方面有独特特征和优势。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web
applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on
highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques
are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model
development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled
access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to
share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the
user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus,
quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to
enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a
membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to
measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS
interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential
privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical
component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality
membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known
benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits
of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 现有大模型处理复杂多模态指令有困难，提出CIMR框架，经实验验证其在复杂任务中表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型和大视觉语言模型在处理复杂多步多模态指令时存在困难，需要逻辑推理、动态反馈整合和迭代自我修正的能力。

Method: 提出CIMR框架，包含上下文感知迭代推理和自我修正模块，分初始推理、响应生成和迭代细化两阶段，动态融合模块深度整合特征，在VIT数据集上微调LLaVA - 1.5 - 7B，在MAP数据集上评估。

Result: CIMR准确率达91.5%，优于GPT - 4V、LLaVA - 1.5、MiniGPT - 4和InstructBLIP等模型。

Conclusion: CIMR的迭代推理和自我修正能力在复杂任务中有效。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced our ability to process and generate
human language and visual information. However, these models often struggle
with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical
reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To
address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a
novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and
self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and
response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal
feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and
contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual
Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced
Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy,
outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5
(78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the
efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出自适应伪标签框架提升CLIP在无监督适应场景性能，实验效果佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP无监督适应中伪标签噪声大，传统过滤方法不可靠。

Method: 提出含PICS和NALR的自适应伪标签框架，引入自适应加权机制。

Result: 在11个基准数据集实验中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能提供更准确伪标签，且保持计算效率。

Abstract: In unsupervised adaptation for vision-language models such as CLIP,
pseudo-labels derived from zero-shot predictions often exhibit significant
noise, particularly under domain shifts or in visually complex scenarios.
Conventional pseudo-label filtering approaches, which rely on fixed confidence
thresholds, tend to be unreliable in fully unsupervised settings. In this work,
we propose a novel adaptive pseudo-labeling framework that enhances CLIP's
adaptation performance by integrating prototype consistency and
neighborhood-based consistency. The proposed method comprises two key
components: PICS, which assesses pseudo-label accuracy based on in-class
feature compactness and cross-class feature separation; and NALR, which
exploits semantic similarities among neighboring samples to refine
pseudo-labels dynamically. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive weighting
mechanism that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labeled samples during training
according to their estimated correctness. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in
unsupervised adaptation scenarios, delivering more accurate pseudo-labels while
maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了两种新型混合激活函数S3和S4，经实验S4表现优于九个基线激活函数，是深度学习应用的通用选择，混合激活函数是改进神经网络训练动态的有前途方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激活函数存在死神经元或梯度消失问题，影响梯度流动、训练稳定性和模型性能，需要改进。

Method: 引入S3和S4激活函数，S3结合sigmoid和softsign，S4有平滑过渡机制；在三种不同神经网络架构上进行二分类、多分类和回归任务实验。

Result: S4在MNIST、Iris分类和Boston Housing回归任务中表现出色，收敛更快，梯度流稳定，梯度范围为[0.24, 0.59]，而ReLU在深度网络中有18%死神经元。

Conclusion: S4通过混合设计和平滑过渡机制解决现有函数关键局限，可调参数k使其适应不同任务和网络深度，混合激活函数是改进神经网络训练动态的有前途方向。

Abstract: Activation functions are critical components in deep neural networks,
directly influencing gradient flow, training stability, and model performance.
Traditional functions like ReLU suffer from dead neuron problems, while sigmoid
and tanh exhibit vanishing gradient issues. We introduce two novel hybrid
activation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4
(smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for
positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a
steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary
classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three
different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance
compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on
MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.
The function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable
gradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's
gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep
networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing
functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism. The
tunable parameter k allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths,
making S4 a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings
suggest that hybrid activation functions represent a promising direction for
improving neural network training dynamics.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型的提示敏感性问题，即提示措辞的微小变化会导致输出不一致或不准确。

Method: 引入TIR框架，在每个生成步骤后进行细化步骤，利用预训练的多模态大语言模型分析输出图像和用户提示，检测不一致并生成细化提示用于下一轮图像生成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，该闭环策略提高了提示与图像的对齐度和视觉连贯性，且能与黑盒文本到图像模型实现即插即用集成。

Conclusion: TIR框架能有效解决文本到图像生成模型的提示敏感性问题，提升生成效果。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have made significant strides but still
struggle with prompt sensitivity: even minor changes in prompt wording can
yield inconsistent or inaccurate outputs. To address this challenge, we
introduce a closed-loop, test-time prompt refinement framework that requires no
additional training of the underlying T2I model, termed TIR. In our approach,
each generation step is followed by a refinement step, where a pretrained
multimodal large language model (MLLM) analyzes the output image and the user's
prompt. The MLLM detects misalignments (e.g., missing objects, incorrect
attributes) and produces a refined and physically grounded prompt for the next
round of image generation. By iteratively refining the prompt and verifying
alignment between the prompt and the image, TIR corrects errors, mirroring the
iterative refinement process of human artists. We demonstrate that this
closed-loop strategy improves alignment and visual coherence across multiple
benchmark datasets, all while maintaining plug-and-play integration with
black-box T2I models.

Motivation: 有限元模拟计算成本高，数据驱动设计需求增长，BO和MFBO缺乏实际工程问题对比，且数据驱动设计中采样质量和参数敏感性评估不足。

Method: 采用Sobol样本和基于方差的敏感性分析降低设计问题复杂度，对比BO和MFBO在自旋体胞状结构能量吸收最大化问题上的性能。

Result: MFBO是最大化自旋体结构能量吸收的有效方法，在不同超参数设置下比BO性能高可达11%，结果开源。

Conclusion: 多保真技术在昂贵的数据驱动设计问题中具有实用性。

Abstract: Finite element (FE) simulations of structures and materials are getting
increasingly more accurate, but also more computationally expensive as a
collateral result. This development happens in parallel with a growing demand
of data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient
optimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously
established as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In
parallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an
objective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level. The
multi-fidelity setting applied to BO, called multi-fidelity BO (MFBO), has also
seen previous success. However, BO and MFBO have not seen a direct comparison
with when faced with with a real-life engineering problem, such as metamaterial
design for deformation and absorption qualities. Moreover, sampling quality and
assessing design parameter sensitivity is often an underrepresented part of
data-driven design. This paper aims to address these shortcomings by employing
Sobol' samples with variance-based sensitivity analysis in order to reduce
design problem complexity. Furthermore, this work describes, implements,
applies and compares the performance BO with that MFBO when maximizing the
energy absorption (EA) problem of spinodoid cellular structures is concerned.
The findings show that MFBO is an effective way to maximize the EA of a
spinodoid structure and is able to outperform BO by up to 11% across various
hyperparameter settings. The results, which are made open-source, serve to
support the utility of multi-fidelity techniques across expensive data-driven
design problems.

Conclusion: SourceSplice能在构建训练数据集时高效选择合适数据源子集，提高下游机器学习模型的效用。

Abstract: Data quality plays a pivotal role in the predictive performance of machine
learning (ML) tasks - a challenge amplified by the deluge of data sources
available in modern organizations.Prior work in data discovery largely focus on
metadata matching, semantic similarity or identifying tables that should be
joined to answer a particular query, but do not consider source quality for
high performance of the downstream ML task.This paper addresses the problem of
determining the best subset of data sources that must be combined to construct
the underlying training dataset for a given ML task.We propose SourceGrasp and
SourceSplice, frameworks designed to efficiently select a suitable subset of
sources that maximizes the utility of the downstream ML model.Both the
algorithms rely on the core idea that sources (or their combinations)
contribute differently to the task utility, and must be judiciously
chosen.While SourceGrasp utilizes a metaheuristic based on a greediness
criterion and randomization, the SourceSplice framework presents a source
selection mechanism inspired from gene splicing - a core concept used in
protein synthesis.We empirically evaluate our algorithms on three real-world
datasets and synthetic datasets and show that, with significantly fewer subset
explorations, SourceSplice effectively identifies subsets of data sources
leading to high task utility.We also conduct studies reporting the sensitivity
of SourceSplice to the decision choices under several settings.

Conclusion: 神经网络依赖可在训练后恢复的可解释模式，研究结果对知识发现和可靠人工智能系统开发有深远意义。

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we
can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we
can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with
certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients
(called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific
features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular
ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural
networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be
recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for
knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized federated learning have focused on addressing
client model heterogeneity. However, most existing methods still require
external data, rely on model decoupling, or adopt partial learning strategies,
which can limit their practicality and scalability. In this paper, we revisit
hypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization
capabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous
personalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which
leverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding
vectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's
heterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we
introduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with
similar model sizes to share heads. Furthermore, we further propose
MH-pFedHNGD, which integrates an optional lightweight global model to improve
generalization. Our framework does not rely on external datasets and does not
require disclosure of client model architectures, thereby offering enhanced
privacy and flexibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and model
settings demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, strong
generalization, and serves as a robust baseline for future research in
model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning.

Result: 所提方法在性能上优于传统强化学习技术，且对网络拓扑变化更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提时空强化学习方法能有效解决传统强化学习在通信网络路由决策中的问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a well-established approach for
optimizing packet routing in communication networks. Standard RL algorithms
typically are based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that
the current state of the environment provides all the necessary information for
system evolution and decision-making. However, this Markovian assumption is
invalid in many practical scenarios, making the MDP and RL frameworks
inadequate to produce the optimal solutions. Additionally, traditional RL
algorithms often employ function approximations (e.g., by neural networks) that
do not explicitly capture the spatial relationships inherent in environments
with complex network topologies. Communication networks are characterized by
dynamic traffic patterns and arbitrary numbers of nodes and links, which
further complicate the decision-making process. To address these challenges, we
propose a spatial-temporal RL approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to adequately capture the spatial
dynamics regarding network topology and temporal traffic patterns,
respectively, to enhance routing decisions. Our evaluation demonstrates that
the proposed method outperforms and is more robust to changes in the network
topology when compared with traditional RL techniques.

Abstract: The emergence of time-series foundation model research elevates the growing
need to measure the (dis)similarity of time-series datasets. A time-series
dataset similarity measure aids research in multiple ways, including model
selection, finetuning, and visualization. In this paper, we propose a
distribution-based method to measure time-series dataset similarity by
leveraging the Wasserstein distance. We consider a time-series dataset an
empirical instantiation of an underlying multivariate normal distribution
(MVN). The similarity between two time-series datasets is thus computed as the
Wasserstein distance between their corresponding MVNs. Comprehensive
experiments and visualization show the effectiveness of our approach.
Specifically, we show how the Wasserstein distance helps identify similar
time-series datasets and facilitates inference performance estimation of
foundation models in both out-of-distribution and transfer learning evaluation,
with high correlations between our proposed measure and the inference loss
(>0.60).

Abstract: Remote fetal monitoring technologies are becoming increasingly common. Yet,
most current systems offer limited interpretability, leaving expectant parents
with raw cardiotocography (CTG) data that is difficult to understand. In this
work, we present CTG-Insight, a multi-agent LLM system that provides structured
interpretations of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals.
Drawing from established medical guidelines, CTG-Insight decomposes each CTG
trace into five medically defined features: baseline, variability,
accelerations, decelerations, and sinusoidal pattern, each analyzed by a
dedicated agent. A final aggregation agent synthesizes the outputs to deliver a
holistic classification of fetal health, accompanied by a natural language
explanation. We evaluate CTG-Insight on the NeuroFetalNet Dataset and compare
it against deep learning models and the single-agent LLM baseline. Results show
that CTG-Insight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (96.4%) and F1-score
(97.8%) while producing transparent and interpretable outputs. This work
contributes an interpretable and extensible CTG analysis framework.

Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning
finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative
reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,
freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by
having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum
algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within
our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms
from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and
instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret
bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum
algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number
of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This
matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.
(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other
parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For
infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we
propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to
which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret,
exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise
all of our results to compact state spaces.

Abstract: Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized
domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While
fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of
cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to
predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas
and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and
video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a
transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI
responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain
encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show
that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical
networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically
outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices.
Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way
towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain.

Result: 实验表明可有效估计数据源的缩放行为，与传统微退火点估计结论不同。

Conclusion: 该方法能实现数据驱动的数据源选择和优化。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for optimizing domain-specific dataset construction
in foundation model training. Specifically, we seek a cost-efficient way to
estimate the quality of data sources (e.g. synthetically generated or filtered
web data, etc.) in order to make optimal decisions about resource allocation
for data sourcing from these sources for the stage two pre-training phase, aka
annealing, with the goal of specializing a generalist pre-trained model to
specific domains. Our approach extends the usual point estimate approaches, aka
micro-annealing, to estimating scaling laws by performing multiple annealing
runs of varying compute spent on data curation and training. This addresses a
key limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data
scaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across
compute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically
analyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling
curves can be estimated for different data sources. Such scaling laws can
inform cost effective resource allocation across different data acquisition
methods (e.g. synthetic data), data sources (e.g. user or web data) and
available compute resources. We validate our approach through experiments on a
pre-trained model with 7 billion parameters. We adapt it to: a domain
well-represented in the pre-training data -- the medical domain, and a domain
underrepresented in the pretraining corpora -- the math domain. We show that
one can efficiently estimate the scaling behaviors of a data source by running
multiple annealing runs, which can lead to different conclusions, had one used
point estimates using the usual micro-annealing technique instead. This enables
data-driven decision-making for selecting and optimizing data sources.

Conclusion: 聚焦内部表征为设计适应性智能系统提供新视角。

Abstract: The pursuit of general intelligence has traditionally centered on external
objectives: an agent's control over its environments or mastery of specific
tasks. This external focus, however, can produce specialized agents that lack
adaptability. We propose representational empowerment, a new perspective
towards a truly agent-centric learning paradigm by moving the locus of control
inward. This objective measures an agent's ability to controllably maintain and
diversify its own knowledge structures. We posit that the capacity -- to shape
one's own understanding -- is an element for achieving better ``preparedness''
distinct from direct environmental influence. Focusing on internal
representations as the main substrate for computing empowerment offers a new
lens through which to design adaptable intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFM生成路径偏离直线，现有增强方法依赖高计算成本的小批量最优传输，需改进。

Method: 从熵最优传输获取灵感，用吉布斯核加权训练对修改经典CFM损失。

Result: 理论上恢复熵最优传输耦合，实践中在多数据集上测试，W - CFM样本质量、保真度和多样性与其他基线相当或更优。

Conclusion: W - CFM克服相关瓶颈，保持原CFM计算效率。

Abstract: Conditional flow matching (CFM) has emerged as a powerful framework for
training continuous normalizing flows due to its computational efficiency and
effectiveness. However, standard CFM often produces paths that deviate
significantly from straight-line interpolations between prior and target
distributions, making generation slower and less accurate due to the need for
fine discretization at inference. Recent methods enhance CFM performance by
inducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on
computationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights
from entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow
Matching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by
weighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this
weighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals,
and we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly
unchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the
minibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes
computational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size. Empirically, we
test our method on unconditional generation on various synthetic and real
datasets, confirming that W-CFM achieves comparable or superior sample quality,
fidelity, and diversity to other alternative baselines while maintaining the
computational efficiency of vanilla CFM.

Motivation: 传统交叉验证可能导致数据子集不能充分代表原始数据集的多样性，引发性能估计偏差，因此深入研究基于聚类的交叉验证策略。

Method: 在20个数据集（平衡和非平衡）上使用四种监督学习算法，比较不同交叉验证策略在偏差、方差和计算成本方面的表现。

Result: 在平衡数据集上，结合Mini Batch K - Means与类分层的技术在偏差和方差方面表现更优，但未显著降低计算成本；在非平衡数据集上，传统分层交叉验证表现更好。比较不同聚类算法时，没有单一算法始终表现卓越。

Conclusion: 本研究有助于改进预测模型评估策略，加深对基于聚类的数据划分技术潜力的理解，重申分层交叉验证等成熟策略的有效性，为提高模型评估的鲁棒性和可靠性提供了视角。

Abstract: Cross-validation plays a fundamental role in Machine Learning, enabling
robust evaluation of model performance and preventing overestimation on
training and validation data. However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to
create data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of
the original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The
objective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based
cross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different
clustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new
cross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class
stratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both
balanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing
cross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost.
The technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification
outperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though
it did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets,
traditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing
lower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for
performance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of
different clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as
superior. Overall, this work contributes to improving predictive model
evaluation strategies by providing a deeper understanding of the potential of
cluster-based data splitting techniques and reaffirming the effectiveness of
well-established strategies like stratified cross-validation. Moreover, it
highlights perspectives for increasing the robustness and reliability of model
evaluations, especially in datasets with clustering characteristics.

Abstract: With the rapid amassing of spatial-temporal (ST) ocean data, many
spatial-temporal data mining (STDM) studies have been conducted to address
various oceanic issues, including climate forecasting and disaster warning.
Compared with typical ST data (e.g., traffic data), ST ocean data is more
complicated but with unique characteristics, e.g., diverse regionality and high
sparsity. These characteristics make it difficult to design and train STDM
models on ST ocean data. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey
of existing studies remains missing in the literature, which hinders not only
computer scientists from identifying the research issues in ocean data mining
but also ocean scientists to apply advanced STDM techniques. In this paper, we
provide a comprehensive survey of existing STDM studies for ocean science.
Concretely, we first review the widely-used ST ocean datasets and highlight
their unique characteristics. Then, typical ST ocean data quality enhancement
techniques are explored. Next, we classify existing STDM studies in ocean
science into four types of tasks, i.e., prediction, event detection, pattern
mining, and anomaly detection, and elaborate on the techniques for these tasks.
Finally, promising research opportunities are discussed. This survey can help
scientists from both computer science and ocean science better understand the
fundamental concepts, key techniques, and open challenges of STDM for ocean

<details>

Motivation: 从不完整、压缩或损坏的数据中重建时空动态，解决传统方法在稀疏传感器布局、噪声测量和不完整采集场景下的不足。

Method: 将压缩感知技术融入SHRED架构，采用基于批量的前向框架与ℓ1正则化；使用自适应损失函数结合MSE、MAE与分段信噪比正则化。

Result: 在多个挑战性问题上验证，相比传统SHRED，CS - SHRED在SSIM、PSNR、归一化误差和LPIPS得分上表现更好。

Conclusion: 联合训练的CS和SHRED设计架构及SNR引导的自适应损失函数使CS - SHRED在环境、气候和科学数据分析中有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We present $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$, a novel deep learning architecture that
integrates Compressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder
($\textbf{SHRED}$) to reconstruct spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete,
compressed, or corrupted data. Our approach introduces two key innovations.
First, by incorporating CS techniques into the $\textbf{SHRED}$ architecture,
our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\ell_1$
regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor
placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an
adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while
preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.
  We validate $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ on challenging problems including
viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface
temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the
traditional $\textbf{SHRED}$ approach, $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ achieves
significantly higher reconstruction fidelity - as demonstrated by improved SSIM
and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby
providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased
robustness against noise and outliers.
  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED
design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing
the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the
high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the
spatiotemporal data recovery establishes $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ as a promising
tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and
scientific data analyses.

Motivation: 设施选址和路径优化（FLPO）问题因混合离散 - 连续结构和非凸目标而为NP难问题，需有效解决方法。

Method: 将最大熵原理（MEP）与最短路径网络（SPN）神经策略模型集成，实现基于梯度的高效优化。

Result: SPN在策略推理和梯度计算上比MEP基线快100倍，平均最优差距约6%；FLPO方法成本比元启发式基线低10倍以上，比Gurobi退火求解快1500倍。

Conclusion: 结构化深度模型在解决大规模混合整数优化任务上有强大能力。

Abstract: We propose a scalable deep learning framework for parametrized sequential
decision-making (ParaSDM), where multiple agents jointly optimize discrete
action policies and shared continuous parameters. A key subclass of this
setting arises in Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO), where
multi-agent systems must simultaneously determine optimal routes and facility
locations, aiming to minimize the cumulative transportation cost within the
network. FLPO problems are NP-hard due to their mixed discrete-continuous
structure and highly non-convex objective. To address this, we integrate the
Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model called the Shortest
Path Network (SPN)-a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder that approximates
the MEP solution while enabling efficient gradient-based optimization over
shared parameters. The SPN achieves up to 100$\times$ speedup in policy
inference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines, with an average
optimality gap of approximately 6% across a wide range of problem sizes. Our
FLPO approach yields over 10$\times$ lower cost than metaheuristic baselines
while running significantly faster, and matches Gurobi's optimal cost with
annealing at a 1500$\times$ speedup-establishing a new state of the art for
ParaSDM problems. These results highlight the power of structured deep models
for solving large-scale mixed-integer optimization tasks.

Motivation: 随着DNN在移动和边缘设备上的部署增加，优化模型效率至关重要。混合精度量化受青睐，但找到每层最优精度难，现有基于位级稀疏性的研究存在训练复杂度高和GPU内存需求大的问题。

Method: 提出MSQ方法，应用round - clamp量化器计算模型权重的最低有效位，用正则化使这些位稀疏，结合Hessian信息同时修剪多个最低有效位。

Result: 与之前的位级量化相比，MSQ可使可训练参数减少达8.00倍，训练时间减少达86%，同时保持有竞争力的准确率和压缩率。

Conclusion: MSQ是在资源受限设备上训练高效DNN的实用解决方案。

Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) see increased deployment on mobile and edge
devices, optimizing model efficiency has become crucial. Mixed-precision
quantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between
efficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the
optimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing
bit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial
training complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose
Memory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that
addresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable
differentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model
weights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,
enabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter
splitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the
simultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.
Experimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable
parameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous
bit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression
rates. This makes it a practical solution for training efficient DNNs on
resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: Spec - VLA框架成功，显示了投机执行在VLA预测场景有更广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made substantial progress by
leveraging the robust capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs). However,
VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose
considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding
(SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple
tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models
remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to
accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and
the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the
advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed
improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism
to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action
tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm
the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates
the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by
44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without
compromising the success rate. The success of the Spec-VLA framework highlights
the potential for broader application of speculative execution in VLA
prediction scenarios.

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often
suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation
induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous
theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study
of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four
distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful
untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful
targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the
behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions,
revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and
identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on
this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which
incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of
floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation
in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss
functions, including CE, C\&W, DLR, and MIFPE, in terms of attack potency and
robustness evaluation accuracy.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，RANA在对齐精度上优于最先进的基于主动学习的方法。

Conclusion: RANA能有效处理网络对齐中的噪声和标签稀疏问题，提高模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Network alignment has attracted widespread attention in various fields.
However, most existing works mainly focus on the problem of label sparsity,
while overlooking the issue of noise in network alignment, which can
substantially undermine model performance. Such noise mainly includes
structural noise from noisy edges and labeling noise caused by human-induced
and process-driven errors. To address these problems, we propose RANA, a Robust
Active learning framework for noisy Network Alignment. RANA effectively tackles
both structure noise and label noise while addressing the sparsity of anchor
link annotations, which can improve the robustness of network alignment models.
Specifically, RANA introduces the proposed Noise-aware Selection Module and the
Label Denoising Module to address structural noise and labeling noise,
respectively. In the first module, we design a noise-aware maximization
objective to select node pairs, incorporating a cleanliness score to address
structural noise. In the second module, we propose a novel multi-source fusion
denoising strategy that leverages model and twin node pairs labeling to provide
more accurate labels for node pairs. Empirical results on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active
learning-based methods in alignment accuracy. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络易受对抗攻击，激活函数是提升模型鲁棒性的关键但未充分探索的组件。

Method: 提出RCR - AF激活函数，结合GELU和ReLU优点，通过两个超参数控制模型稀疏性和容量，并基于Rademacher复杂度进行理论分析。

Result: RCR - AF在标准训练的干净准确率和对抗训练的对抗鲁棒性上均优于常用激活函数。

Conclusion: RCR - AF能有效提升模型的泛化和对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive
applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet
underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher
Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function
designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF
uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient
stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable
monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity
through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$
and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity,
demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher
complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used
alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard
training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supporting
clinical decisions. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
shown strong potential in clinical prediction tasks due to their ability to
process visual and textual information. However, challenges related to
deployment cost, data privacy, and model reliability hinder their adoption. In
this study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performance
of open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningful
explanations. The framework incorporates visual knowledge transfer, abductive
reasoning, and a short-term memory mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy and
interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
achieves predictive performance and interpretability comparable to proprietary
models. It also provides plausible clinical reasoning processes behind each
prediction. Our method sheds new light on building AI systems for healthcare
that combine predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.

Conclusion: Proto - EVFL框架有效解决纵向联邦学习中类别不平衡问题，有良好性能。

Abstract: In vertical federated learning (VFL), multiple enterprises address aligned
sample scarcity by leveraging massive locally unaligned samples to facilitate
collaborative learning. However, unaligned samples across different parties in
VFL can be extremely class-imbalanced, leading to insufficient feature
representation and limited model prediction space. Specifically,
class-imbalanced problems consist of intra-party class imbalance and
inter-party class imbalance, which can further cause local model bias and
feature contribution inconsistency issues, respectively. To address the above
challenges, we propose Proto-EVFL, an enhanced VFL framework via dual
prototypes. We first introduce class prototypes for each party to learn
relationships between classes in the latent space, allowing the active party to
predict unseen classes. We further design a probabilistic dual prototype
learning scheme to dynamically select unaligned samples by conditional optimal
transport cost with class prior probability. Moreover, a mixed prior guided
module guides this selection process by combining local and global class prior
probabilities. Finally, we adopt an \textit{adaptive gated feature aggregation
strategy} to mitigate feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically
weighting and aggregating local features across different parties. We proved
that Proto-EVFL, as the first bi-level optimization framework in VFL, has a
convergence rate of 1/\sqrt T. Extensive experiments on various datasets
validate the superiority of our Proto-EVFL. Even in a zero-shot scenario with
one unseen class, it outperforms baselines by at least 6.97%

Method: 通过实验证明数据本身的损失能反映其遗忘难度，提出Loss - based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn)策略，在无学习过程中动态重新加权数据。

Result: 在图像分类和生成任务中显著缩小了现有机器无学习方法与精确无学习的差距，有效增强了文本到图像扩散模型中对有害内容生成的预防。

Conclusion: LoReUn策略简单有效，是一种即插即用的方法，能以最小的额外计算开销提升机器无学习效果。

Abstract: Recent generative models face significant risks of producing harmful content,
which has underscored the importance of machine unlearning (MU) as a critical
technique for eliminating the influence of undesired data. However, existing MU
methods typically assign the same weight to all data to be forgotten, which
makes it difficult to effectively forget certain data that is harder to unlearn
than others. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the loss of data
itself can implicitly reflect its varying difficulty. Building on this insight,
we introduce Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn), a simple yet effective
plug-and-play strategy that dynamically reweights data during the unlearning
process with minimal additional computational overhead. Our approach
significantly reduces the gap between existing MU methods and exact unlearning
in both image classification and generation tasks, effectively enhancing the
prevention of harmful content generation in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation, an ex-post technique applied to forecasts that must
satisfy constraints, has been a prominent topic in the forecasting literature
over the past two decades. Recently, several efforts have sought to extend
reconciliation methods to the probabilistic settings. Nevertheless, formal
theorems demonstrating error reduction in nonlinear contexts, analogous to
those presented in Panagiotelis et al.(2021), are still lacking. This paper
addresses that gap by establishing such theorems for various classes of
nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions. Specifically, we derive an
exact analog of Theorem 3.1 from Panagiotelis et al.(2021) for hypersurfaces
with constant-sign curvature. Additionally, we provide probabilistic guarantees
for the broader case of hypersurfaces with non-constant-sign curvature and for
general vector-valued functions. To support reproducibility and practical
adoption, we release a JAX-based Python package, \emph{to be released upon
publication}, implementing the presented theorems and reconciliation
procedures.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is an increasingly critical task within drug
discovery and development. Typically, neural networks can learn molecular
properties using graph-based, language-based or feature-based methods. Recent
advances in natural language processing have highlighted the capabilities of
neural networks to learn complex human language using masked language
modelling. These approaches to training large transformer-based deep learning
models have also been used to learn the language of molecules, as represented
by simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings. Here, we
present novel domain-specific text-to-text pretraining tasks that yield
improved performance in six classification-based molecular property prediction
benchmarks, relative to both traditional likelihood-based training and
previously proposed fine-tuning tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that
data and computational efficiency can be improved by using these
domain-specific pretraining tasks. Finally, the pretrained embeddings from the
model can be used as fixed inputs into a downstream machine learning classifier
and yield comparable performance to finetuning but with much lower
computational overhead.

balanced and unbalanced datasets. Extensive experiments show that GCNConv
models excel on unbalanced data, while all models perform consistently on
balanced data. Experiments also confirm the superior performance of HGCN(O)
over traditional approaches. Applications include Predictive Business Process

Conclusion: FGFP框架是一种有效的网络压缩方法，在精度和压缩率上表现良好。

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent
years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge
devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network
parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To
address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)
framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian
function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the
computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we
introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the
fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each
kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional
Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured
Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various
architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent
methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a
1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012,
ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size
by 69.1%.

Conclusion: 所提出的BN模型能理解事故致拥堵的复杂关系，具有高可靠性，可保障城市交通顺畅。

Abstract: Traffic congestion due to uncertainties, such as accidents, is a significant
issue in urban areas, as the ripple effect of accidents causes longer delays,
increased emissions, and safety concerns. To address this issue, we propose a
robust framework for predicting the impact of accidents on congestion. We
implement Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-enhanced Deep Embedding
Clustering (DEC) to assign congestion labels to accident data and predict
congestion probability using a Bayesian Network (BN). The Simulation of Urban
Mobility (SUMO) simulation is utilized to evaluate the correctness of BN
predictions using evidence-based scenarios. Results demonstrate that the
AutoML-enhanced DEC has outperformed traditional clustering approaches. The
performance of the proposed BN model achieved an overall accuracy of 95.6%,
indicating its ability to understand the complex relationship of accidents
causing congestion. Validation in SUMO with evidence-based scenarios
demonstrated that the BN model's prediction of congestion states closely
matches those of SUMO, indicating the high reliability of the proposed BN model
in ensuring smooth urban mobility.

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and
other sequence modeling domains, where the choice of vocabulary size
significantly impacts model performance. Despite its importance, selecting an
optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics
or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for
determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions
through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with
how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning
with Zipfian scaling improves both model efficiency and effectiveness.
Extensive experiments across NLP, genomics, and chemistry demonstrate that
models consistently achieve peak performance when the token distribution
closely adheres to Zipf's law, establishing Zipfian alignment as a robust and
generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection.

Abstract: To understand our global progress for sustainable development and disaster
risk reduction in many developing economies, two recent major initiatives - the
Uniform African Exposure Dataset of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM)
Foundation and the Modelling Exposure through Earth Observation Routines
(METEOR) Project - implemented classical spatial disaggregation techniques to
generate large-scale mapping of urban morphology using the information from
various satellite imagery and its derivatives, geospatial datasets of the built
environment, and subnational census statistics. However, the local discrepancy
with well-validated census statistics and the propagated model uncertainties
remain a challenge in such coarse-to-fine-grained mapping problems,
specifically constrained by weak and conditional label supervision. Therefore,
we present Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4), a novel
deep learning-based spatial disaggregation approach that incorporates local
census statistics as cluster-level constraints while considering multiple
conditional label relationships in a joint multitask learning of the patterns
of satellite imagery. To demonstrate, compared to GEM and METEOR, we enhanced
the quality of Rwandan maps of urban morphology, specifically building exposure
and physical vulnerability, at the third-level administrative unit from the

Conclusion: VAR方案能帮助机器学习模型开发者在特定条件下识别最优模型，更好理解Rashomon集合整体特征。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of closely matched machine learning(ML) models
under specific conditions has long been a focus of researchers in the field of
machine learning. The Rashomon set is a collection of closely matched ML
models, encompassing a wide range of models with similar accuracies but
different structures. Traditionally, the analysis of these sets has focused on
vertical structural analysis, which involves comparing the corresponding
features at various levels within the ML models. However, there has been a lack
of effective visualization methods for horizontally comparing multiple models
with specific features. We propose the VAR visualization solution. VAR uses
visualization to perform comparisons of ML models within the Rashomon set. This
solution combines heatmaps and scatter plots to facilitate the comparison. With
the help of VAR, ML model developers can identify the optimal model under
specific conditions and better understand the Rashomon set's overall
characteristics.

Conclusion: RLDP能在保证隐私的同时，提升模型效用和训练效率，且对攻击的敏感性不高于基线。

Abstract: The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining
bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained
on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic
gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a
pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,
degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been
proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control
knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization
landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy
budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay
within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP
optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep
reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the
learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter
gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian
noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language
model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget
where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation
experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers
perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream
utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of
the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same
($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility
to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.

monotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise
nonnegative. Despite their simple definition, an easy characterization in terms
of the matrix elements or the derived parameters is not known. Here, we
present, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning
approach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from
non-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly
generated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ
deep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or
non-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix
features. By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify among
all features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient information
for the matrix classification, with $95\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute values
of the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix's
characteristic polynomial. A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\times7$
matrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert\le0.18$
with probability $>99.98\%$; because $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert =
1/\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound
$\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\ge5.7$.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于数据的方法，利用深度神经网络研究细胞几何形状与分裂平面定位关系，模型能解释现有几何规则无法解释的胚胎分裂模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于假设的方法需先定义测试规则，存在局限性，因此需新方法研究细胞几何形状与分裂平面定位的关系。

Method: 采用基于图像的细胞表示，使用修改后的UNet架构从母细胞几何形状学习和预测分裂模式，并在合成数据和拟南芥胚胎细胞上评估模型性能。

Result: 训练后的模型能解释现有几何规则无法解释的胚胎分裂模式。

Conclusion: 深度网络有潜力理解细胞分裂模式并产生关于细胞分裂定位控制的新假设。

Abstract: The positioning of new cellular walls during cell division plays a key role
in shaping plant tissue organization. The influence of cell geometry on the
positioning of division planes has been previously captured into various
geometrical rules. Accordingly, linking cell shape to division orientation has
relied on the comparison between observed division patterns and predictions
under specific rules. The need to define a priori the tested rules is a
fundamental limitation of this hypothesis-driven approach. As an alternative,
we introduce a data-based approach to investigate the relation between cell
geometry and division plane positioning, exploiting the ability of deep neural
network to learn complex relationships across multidimensional spaces. Adopting
an image-based cell representation, we show how division patterns can be
learned and predicted from mother cell geometry using a UNet architecture
modified to operate on cell masks. Using synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo
cells, we evaluate the model performances on a wide range of diverse cell
shapes and division patterns. We find that the trained model accounted for
embryo division patterns that were previously irreconcilable under existing
geometrical rules. Our work shows the potential of deep networks to understand
cell division patterns and to generate new hypotheses on the control of cell
division positioning.

Abstract: Different from existing federated fine-tuning (FFT) methods for foundation
models, hybrid heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (HHFFT) is an under-explored
scenario where clients exhibit double heterogeneity in model architectures and
downstream tasks. This hybrid heterogeneity introduces two significant
challenges: 1) heterogeneous matrix aggregation, where clients adopt different
large-scale foundation models based on their task requirements and resource
limitations, leading to dimensional mismatches during LoRA parameter
aggregation; and 2) multi-task knowledge interference, where local shared
parameters, trained with both task-shared and task-specific knowledge, cannot
ensure only task-shared knowledge is transferred between clients. To address
these challenges, we propose H2Tune, a federated foundation model fine-tuning
with hybrid heterogeneity. Our framework H2Tune consists of three key
components: (i) sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden
dimensions across clients through constructing rank-consistent middle matrices,
with adaptive sparsification based on client resources; (ii) relation-guided
matrix layer alignment to handle heterogeneous layer structures and
representation capabilities; and (iii) alternating task-knowledge
disentanglement mechanism to decouple shared and specific knowledge of local
model parameters through alternating optimization. Theoretical analysis proves
a convergence rate of O(1/\sqrt{T}). Extensive experiments show our method
achieves up to 15.4% accuracy improvement compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our code is available at

Abstract: Transductive learning is a supervised machine learning task in which, unlike
in traditional inductive learning, the unlabelled data that require labelling
are a finite set and are available at training time. Similarly to inductive
learning contexts, transductive learning contexts may be affected by dataset
shift, i.e., may be such that the IID assumption does not hold. We here propose
a method, tailored to transductive classification contexts, for performing
model selection (i.e., hyperparameter optimisation) when the data exhibit prior
probability shift, an important type of dataset shift typical of anti-causal
learning problems. In our proposed method the hyperparameters can be optimised
directly on the unlabelled data to which the trained classifier must be
applied; this is unlike traditional model selection methods, that are based on
performing cross-validation on the labelled training data. We provide
experimental results that show the benefits brought about by our method.

Abstract: Random forests are a machine learning method used to automatically classify
datasets and consist of a multitude of decision trees. While these random
forests often have higher performance and generalize better than a single
decision tree, they are also harder to interpret. This paper presents a
visualization method and system to increase interpretability of random forests.
We cluster similar trees which enables users to interpret how the model
performs in general without needing to analyze each individual decision tree in
detail, or interpret an oversimplified summary of the full forest. To
meaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric
that takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a
pair of decision trees. We also propose two new visualization methods that
visualize both clustered and individual decision trees: (1) The Feature Plot,
which visualizes the topological position of features in the decision trees,
and (2) the Rule Plot, which visualizes the decision rules of the decision
trees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a case study on the
"Glass" dataset, which is a relatively complex standard machine learning
dataset, as well as a small user study.

Conclusion: 量子计算在数据受限问题中具有应用潜力，在特定信号域和域位置上有更好的学习效果。

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells engineered to recognize
and kill specific tumor cells. Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells
bind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation.
These processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the
intracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling
components into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell
phenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on
libraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial
space defined by such libraries. This leads to a highly data constrained,
poorly explored combinatorial problem, where the experiments undersample all
possible combinations. We propose a quantum approach using a Projected Quantum
Kernel (PQK) to address this challenge. PQK operates by embedding classical
data into a high dimensional Hilbert space and employs a kernel method to
measure sample similarity. Using 61 qubits on a gate-based quantum computer, we
demonstrate the largest PQK application to date and an enhancement in the
classification performance over purely classical machine learning methods for
CAR T cytotoxicity prediction. Importantly, we show improved learning for
specific signaling domains and domain positions, particularly where there was
lower information highlighting the potential for quantum computing in
data-constrained problems.

Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material
stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data
evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various
process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material
stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy.
However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to
changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we
introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the
process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian
Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models
to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties
contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments
while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the
requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are
considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We
evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

Abstract: Distilling large neural networks into simple, human-readable symbolic
formulas is a promising path toward trustworthy and interpretable AI. However,
this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standard
networks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelity
student models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to address
this challenge. Instead of passively distilling a pre-trained network, we
introduce a \textbf{Jacobian-based regularizer} that actively encourages the
``teacher'' network to learn functions that are not only accurate but also
inherently smoother and more amenable to distillation. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments on a suite of real-world regression benchmarks that our
method is highly effective. By optimizing the regularization strength for each
problem, we improve the $R^2$ score of the final distilled symbolic model by an
average of \textbf{120\% (relative)} compared to the standard distillation
pipeline, all while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. Our work
presents a practical and principled method for significantly improving the
fidelity of interpretable models extracted from complex neural networks.

Method: 对现有性能预测方法进行推广以直接估计全混淆矩阵，并在胸部X光数据的不同分布偏移情况下进行基准测试。

Result: 提出的混淆矩阵估计方法能可靠预测医学图像在分布偏移下的临床相关计数指标，但模拟偏移场景暴露了当前性能估计技术的失效模式。

Conclusion: 在为医学AI模型上市后监测实施性能监测技术时，需要更好地理解现实世界部署环境。

Abstract: Performance monitoring is essential for safe clinical deployment of image
classification models. However, because ground-truth labels are typically
unavailable in the target dataset, direct assessment of real-world model
performance is infeasible. State-of-the-art performance estimation methods
address this by leveraging confidence scores to estimate the target accuracy.
Despite being a promising direction, the established methods mainly estimate
the model's accuracy and are rarely evaluated in a clinical domain, where
strong class imbalances and dataset shifts are common. Our contributions are
twofold: First, we introduce generalisations of existing performance prediction
methods that directly estimate the full confusion matrix. Then, we benchmark
their performance on chest x-ray data in real-world distribution shifts as well
as simulated covariate and prevalence shifts. The proposed confusion matrix
estimation methods reliably predicted clinically relevant counting metrics on
medical images under distribution shifts. However, our simulated shift
scenarios exposed important failure modes of current performance estimation
techniques, calling for a better understanding of real-world deployment
contexts when implementing these performance monitoring techniques for
postmarket surveillance of medical AI models.

Abstract: Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are
gaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in
quantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models
(\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such
as those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,
such as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a
fundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable
models on real-world datasets. \textit{In this paper, we develop an
Expectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined
through \textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those
used for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,
designing such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined
quantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation
step. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum
information projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map
provides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we
introduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an
iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence
lower bound. We show that the \textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing
log-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we
present Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\textbf{QiDBMs}), a
\textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained
with \textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \textbf{QiDBM} outperforms
larger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a
40--60\% reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become an increasingly
popular paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) and diffusion
models. While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress,
they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows
and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may
encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement,
and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this
paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF
training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a
parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient
orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single
centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that
adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable
training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat
product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that
G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid
foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned
models.

Abstract: We present a foundation model-derived method to identify highly informative

anomalous events that rule-based approaches would consider within a normal

predicting downstream patient outcomes and that a fraction of events identified
as carrying little information can safely be dropped. Additionally, we show how
informativeness can help interpret the predictions of prognostic models trained
on foundation model-derived representations.

Abstract: Accurate quality prediction in multi-process manufacturing is critical for
industrial efficiency but hindered by three core challenges: time-lagged
process interactions, overlapping operations with mixed periodicity, and
inter-process dependencies in shared frequency bands. To address these, we
propose PAF-Net, a frequency decoupled time series prediction framework with
three key innovations: (1) A phase-correlation alignment method guided by
frequency domain energy to synchronize time-lagged quality series, resolving
temporal misalignment. (2) A frequency independent patch attention mechanism
paired with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) decomposition to capture
heterogeneous operational features within individual series. (3) A frequency
decoupled cross attention module that suppresses noise from irrelevant
frequencies, focusing exclusively on meaningful dependencies within shared
bands. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets demonstrate PAF-Net's superiority.
It outperforms 10 well-acknowledged baselines by 7.06% lower MSE and 3.88%
lower MAE. Our code is available at

Conclusion: RLVMR框架提升推理质量，减少冗余动作、增强错误恢复能力，使智能体更健壮、高效和可解释。

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a
central goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical
limitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final
task success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem
we term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail
to generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason
coherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that
integrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding
verifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag
its cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and
provides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to
effective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the
final outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.
On the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new
state-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on
the most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem
from improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant
actions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and
interpretable agents.

Conclusion: D - DP - PM方法收敛快，可在保持竞争力的效用下通过迭代换取增强的隐私。

Abstract: We propose a novel Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method
(D-DP-PM) for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in networked
multi-agent settings. Unlike conventional decentralized PCA approaches where
each agent accesses the full n-dimensional sample space, we address the
challenging scenario where each agent observes only a subset of dimensions
through row-wise data partitioning. Our method ensures
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) while enabling collaborative
estimation of global eigenvectors across the network without requiring a
central aggregator. We achieve this by having agents share only local
embeddings of the current eigenvector iterate, leveraging both the inherent
privacy from random initialization and carefully calibrated Gaussian noise
additions. We prove that our algorithm satisfies the prescribed
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee and establish convergence rates that
explicitly characterize the impact of the network topology. Our theoretical
analysis, based on linear dynamics and high-dimensional probability theory,
provides tight bounds on both privacy and utility. Experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that D-DP-PM achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs
compared to naive local DP approaches, with particularly strong performance in
moderate privacy regimes ($\epsilon\in[2, 5]$). The method converges rapidly,
allowing practitioners to trade iterations for enhanced privacy while
maintaining competitive utility.

Motivation: 传统模型如LIF神经元存在不足，需要一种能捕捉更丰富时间特征、支持时序敏感计算的模型。

Method: 基于阻尼驱动摆动力学构建模型，分析单神经元动力学，将模型扩展到多神经元层并采用STDP学习规则，用Python和Brian2实现，提出在神经形态硬件平台部署的方法。

Result: 成功构建模型并进行分析，给出实现代码和部署方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发用于神经形态计算和序列认知任务的节能神经系统提供基础。

Abstract: We propose a biologically inspired model of spiking neurons based on the
dynamics of a damped, driven pendulum. Unlike traditional models such as the
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons, the pendulum neuron incorporates
second-order, nonlinear dynamics that naturally give rise to oscillatory
behavior and phase-based spike encoding. This model captures richer temporal
features and supports timing-sensitive computations critical for sequence
processing and symbolic learning. We present an analysis of single-neuron
dynamics and extend the model to multi-neuron layers governed by Spike-Timing
Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rules. We demonstrate practical
implementation with python code and with the Brian2 spiking neural simulator,
and outline a methodology for deploying the model on neuromorphic hardware
platforms, using an approximation of the second-order equations. This framework
offers a foundation for developing energy-efficient neural systems for
neuromorphic computing and sequential cognition tasks.

Result: 构建了绕过硬件漏洞方法、无硬件PMU依赖的Roofline工具及统一工作流程的开源工具链。

Conclusion: 该实用方法可在受限或不可靠硬件条件下为RISC - V系统提取可操作的性能见解。

Abstract: As RISC-V architectures proliferate across embedded and high-performance
domains, developers face persistent challenges in performance optimization due
to fragmented tooling, immature hardware features, and platform-specific
defects. This paper delivers a pragmatic methodology for extracting actionable
performance insights on RISC-V systems, even under constrained or unreliable
hardware conditions. We present a workaround to circumvent hardware bugs in one
of the popular RISC-V implementations, enabling robust event sampling. For
memory-compute bottleneck analysis, we introduce compiler-driven Roofline
tooling that operates without hardware PMU dependencies, leveraging LLVM-based
instrumentation to derive operational intensity and throughput metrics directly
from application IR. Our open source toolchain automates these workarounds,
unifying PMU data correction and compiler-guided Roofline construction into a
single workflow.

Result: 展示了Ecoscape在边缘机器学习推理中的能力。

Conclusion: Ecoscape为优化边缘系统容错性提供了清晰框架，无需物理边缘测试平台。

Abstract: Edge computing offers significant advantages for realtime data processing
tasks, such as object recognition, by reducing network latency and bandwidth
usage. However, edge environments are susceptible to various types of fault. A
remediator is an automated software component designed to adjust the
configuration parameters of a software service dynamically. Its primary
function is to maintain the services operational state within predefined
Service Level Objectives by applying corrective actions in response to
deviations from these objectives. Remediators can be implemented based on the
Kubernetes container orchestration tool by implementing remediation strategies
such as rescheduling or adjusting application parameters. However, currently,
there is no method to compare these remediation strategies fairly. This paper
introduces Ecoscape, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of remediation strategies in fault-prone environments. Using Chaos
Engineering techniques, Ecoscape simulates realistic fault scenarios and
provides a quantifiable score to assess the efficacy of different remediation
approaches. In addition, it is configurable to support domain-specific Service
Level Objectives. We demonstrate the capabilities of Ecoscape in edge machine
learning inference, offering a clear framework to optimize fault tolerance in
these systems without needing a physical edge testbed.

*Wenjie Jacky Mo,Qin Liu,Xiaofei Wen,Dongwon Jung,Hadi Askari,Wenxuan Zhou,Zhe Zhao,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出RedCoder用于评估代码生成LLM安全性，实验显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成LLM在对抗设置下易生成漏洞代码，而红队评估方法需大量人力，缺乏扩展性，且忽视多轮交互。

Method: 构建RedCoder，先通过多智能体游戏模拟对抗交互得到原型对话和攻击策略，再微调LLM作为其核心，部署后自主与Code LLMs多轮对话并动态调用策略。

Result: 实验表明RedCoder在诱导代码生成漏洞方面优于先前单轮和多轮红队方法。

Conclusion: RedCoder是评估现代代码生成系统安全边界的可扩展有效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation (i.e., Code LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in AI-assisted software development and
testing. However, recent studies have shown that these models are prone to
generating vulnerable or even malicious code under adversarial settings.
Existing red-teaming approaches rely on extensive human effort, limiting their
scalability and practicality, and generally overlook the interactive nature of
real-world AI-assisted programming, which often unfolds over multiple turns. To
bridge these gaps, we present RedCoder, a red-teaming agent that engages victim
models in multi-turn conversation to elicit vulnerable code. The pipeline to
construct RedCoder begins with a multi-agent gaming process that simulates
adversarial interactions, yielding a set of prototype conversations and an
arsenal of reusable attack strategies. We then fine-tune an LLM on these
prototype conversations to serve as the backbone of RedCoder. Once deployed,
RedCoder autonomously engages Code LLMs in multi-turn conversations,
dynamically retrieving relevant strategies from the arsenal to steer the
dialogue toward vulnerability-inducing outputs. Experiments across multiple
Code LLMs show that our approach outperforms prior single-turn and multi-turn
red-team methods in inducing vulnerabilities in code generation, offering a
scalable and effective tool for evaluating the security boundaries of modern
code-generation systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出RandLuzz将大语言模型与定向模糊测试结合，去除种子随机性、减少变异器随机性，提升模糊测试效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模糊测试中随机性降低效率，定向模糊测试仍受随机性挑战，需解决种子和变异器中的随机性问题。

Method: 提出RandLuzz，分析函数调用链或功能引导大语言模型生成可达种子，用大语言模型进行漏洞分析构建特定漏洞变异器。

Result: 与四个先进定向模糊测试工具对比，使用RandLuzz生成的种子，模糊测试工具平均加速2.1 - 4.8倍，单个漏洞检测最高加速2.7倍，8个漏洞可在60秒内检测到。

Conclusion: RandLuzz能有效提高种子和变异器质量，实现高效漏洞暴露。

Abstract: Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of
randomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of
fuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed
fuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,
the dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical
components, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely
tied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the
challenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to
remove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With
their strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to
generate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct
bug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which
integrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and
mutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call
chain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To
construct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,
obtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which
further help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate
RandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,
Beacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers
achieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\times$ to 4.8$\times$ compared to
using widely-used initial seeds. Additionally, when evaluated on individual
bugs, RandLuzz achieves up to a 2.7$\times$ speedup compared to the
second-fastest exposure. On 8 bugs, RandLuzz can even expose them within 60
seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试数据生成方法无法处理企业级protobuf模式中复杂的嵌套和图状结构，给性能测试带来挑战。

Method: 利用Python元类系统进行动态类型增强，对生产日志进行统计分析以提取实际值域，结合自动模式内省、统计值分布分析和递归下降算法处理深层嵌套结构。

Result: 在三个真实企业系统上实验，测试数据准备时间最多减少95%，测试覆盖率提高80%，能处理多达15层嵌套的protobuf结构，几秒内生成超10万个测试用例的综合测试套件。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了企业级protobuf系统性能测试的测试数据生成难题，提升了测试效率和覆盖度。

Abstract: Large-scale enterprise systems utilizing Protocol Buffers (protobuf) present
significant challenges for performance testing, particularly when targeting
intermediate business interfaces with complex nested data structures.
Traditional test data generation approaches are inadequate for handling the
intricate hierarchical and graph-like structures inherent in enterprise
protobuf schemas. This paper presents a novel test data generation framework
that leverages Python's metaclass system for dynamic type enhancement and
statistical analysis of production logs for realistic value domain extraction.
Our approach combines automatic schema introspection, statistical value
distribution analysis, and recursive descent algorithms for handling deeply
nested structures. Experimental evaluation on three real-world enterprise
systems demonstrates up to 95\% reduction in test data preparation time and
80\% improvement in test coverage compared to existing approaches. The
framework successfully handles protobuf structures with up to 15 levels of
nesting and generates comprehensive test suites containing over 100,000 test
cases within seconds.

Result: CodableLLM能有效增强反编译代码与源代码表示的对齐，在数据集创建方面表现良好。

Conclusion: CodableLLM为专注于代码的大语言模型生成数据集提供了强大且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of large, high-quality datasets for code understanding and
generation remains a significant challenge, particularly when aligning
decompiled binaries with their original source code. To address this, we
present CodableLLM, a Python framework designed to automate the creation and
curation of datasets by mapping decompiled functions to their corresponding
source functions. This process enhances the alignment between decompiled and
source code representations, facilitating the development of large language
models (LLMs) capable of understanding and generating code across multiple
abstraction levels. CodableLLM supports multiple programming languages and
integrates with existing decompilers and parsers to streamline dataset
generation. This paper presents the design and implementation of CodableLLM,
evaluates its performance in dataset creation, and compares it to existing
tools in the field. The results demonstrate that CodableLLM offers a robust and
efficient solution for generating datasets tailored for code-focused LLMS.

Motivation: Git协作算法未被充分理解，diff和merge算法有应用潜力，需深入了解。

Method: 记录Git计算diff、运行merge及实现复杂操作的主要功能。

Result: 发现多种Git意外行为，如histogram diff算法特殊情况、默认merge策略耗时问题、merge和rebase非交换性等。

Conclusion: Git的diff和merge算法存在多种意外情况和未明确规定的结果。

Abstract: Despite being widely used, the algorithms that enable collaboration with Git
are not well understood. The diff and merge algorithms are particularly
interesting, as they could be applied in other contexts. In this thesis, I
document the main functionalities of Git: how diffs are computed, how they are
used to run merges, and how merges enable more complex operations. In the
process, I show multiple unexpected behaviors in Git, including the following:
The histogram diff algorithm has pathological cases where a single-line change
can cause the entire rest of the file to be marked as changed. The default
merge strategy (ort) can result in merges requiring exponential time in the
number of commits in the history. Merges and rebases are not commutative, and
even when merges do not result in a conflict, the result is not specified but
depends on the diff algorithm used. And finally, sometimes when two sides of a
merge add different lines at the same position, the result is not a conflict,
but a merge containing both changes after each other, in arbitrary order.

TL;DR: 提出CodeEvo框架合成代码数据，实验表明基于其数据微调的模型在代码生成基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取高质量指令 - 代码对对于训练代码生成大语言模型至关重要，手动整理数据成本高且规模受限，现有方法缺乏严格数据验证。

Method: 提出CodeEvo框架，通过两个大语言模型代理（Coder和Reviewer）迭代交互合成代码数据，引入结合编译器确定性和代理生成灵活性的混合反馈机制。

Result: 基于CodeEvo数据微调的模型在不同难度的代码生成基准测试中显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 从多视角为有效的以代码为中心的数据合成提供了见解。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instruction-code pairs is essential for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. Manually curated data is expensive
and inherently limited in scale, motivating the development of code-centric
synthesis methods. Yet, current approaches either focus on augmenting existing
code or rely on predefined heuristics, both lacking rigorous data validation,
which results in synthetic data that is ungrounded, repetitive, or overly
simplistic. Inspired by collaborative programming practices, we propose
CodeEvo, a framework that synthesizes code data through iterative interactions
between two LLM agents: a Coder, which generates candidate code and test cases
based on given instructions, and a Reviewer, which guides the synthesis process
by producing new instructions and feedback. We further introduce a hybrid
feedback mechanism that combines compiler determinism with the generative
flexibility of agents, enabling automatic quality control throughout synthesis.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on CodeEvo data
significantly outperform established baselines across code generation
benchmarks with various difficulties. In-depth analyses further provide
insights from multiple perspectives into effective code-centric data synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新手程序员常采用语法特定和测试用例驱动的方法，AI编码工具会加剧问题，需要引导新手理解代码正确性。

Method: 引入BOOP框架，包含形式规范、与语言无关的算法开发、实现和正确性证明四个阶段，并通过VS Code扩展和预处理器实施。

Result: 初步评估显示学生算法推理能力提升，试错调试减少，学生对边界情况理解更好，问题分解能力增强，教师观察到学生基础技能比传统方法更强，但部分学生觉得格式冗长。

Conclusion: BOOP框架有助于提升新手程序员的算法推理能力和基础技能，虽有格式冗长问题但整体有效。

Abstract: Novice programmers frequently adopt a syntax-specific and test-case-driven
approach, writing code first and adjusting until programs compile and test
cases pass, rather than developing correct solutions through systematic
reasoning. AI coding tools exacerbate this challenge by providing syntactically
correct but conceptually flawed solutions. In this paper, we introduce BOOP
(Blueprint, Operations, OCaml, Proof), a structured framework requiring four
mandatory phases: formal specification, language-agnostic algorithm
development, implementation, and correctness proof. This shifts focus from
``making code work'' to understanding why code is correct.
  BOOP was implemented at our institution using a VS Code extension and
preprocessor that enforces constraints and identifies counterproductive
patterns. Initial evaluation shows improved algorithmic reasoning and reduced
trial-and-error debugging. Students reported better edge case understanding and
problem decomposition, though some initially found the format verbose.
Instructors observed stronger foundational skills compared to traditional
approaches.

Motivation: 动态语言如Python的类型推断是软件工程挑战，LLMs类型推断能力待探索。

Method: 引入TypyBench基准，包含TypeSim和TypeCheck两个新指标，在50个Python仓库数据集评估LLMs。

Result: LLMs有不错TypeSim分数，但在复杂嵌套类型和类型一致性上有困难。

Conclusion: 未来研究应从提升类型相似度转向解决仓库级一致性，TypyBench为此提供基础。

Abstract: Type inference for dynamic languages like Python is a persistent challenge in
software engineering. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
code understanding, their type inference capabilities remain underexplored. We
introduce TypyBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' type inference
across entire Python repositories. TypyBench features two novel metrics:
TypeSim, which captures nuanced semantic relationships between predicted and
ground truth types, and TypeCheck, which assesses type consistency across
codebases. Our evaluation of various LLMs on a curated dataset of 50
high-quality Python repositories reveals that, although LLMs achieve decent
TypeSim scores, they struggle with complex nested types and exhibit significant
type consistency errors. These findings suggest that future research should
shift focus from improving type similarity to addressing repository-level
consistency. TypyBench provides a foundation for this new direction, offering
insights into model performance across different type complexities and usage
contexts. Our code and data are available at

Result: 当前大语言模型能可靠复现软件包功能，性能与传统库无差异。

Conclusion: 未来将从静态的人工维护软件包转向灵活的按需代码生成，利用已发表文章实现分析流程自动化，可降低维护成本。

Abstract: Maintaining software packages imposes significant costs due to dependency
management, bug fixes, and versioning. We show that rich method descriptions in
scientific publications can serve as standalone specifications for modern large
language models (LLMs), enabling on-demand code generation that could supplant
human-maintained libraries. We benchmark state-of-the-art models
(GPT-o4-mini-high, Gemini Pro 2.5, Claude Sonnet 4) by tasking them with
implementing a diverse set of core algorithms drawn from original publications.
Our results demonstrate that current LLMs can reliably reproduce package
functionality with performance indistinguishable from conventional libraries.
These findings foreshadow a paradigm shift toward flexible, on-demand code
generation and away from static, human-maintained packages, which will result
in reduced maintenance overhead by leveraging published articles as sufficient
context for the automated implementation of analytical workflows.

Result: 解释可辅助人类开发者理解代理输出，可用于自动化问题解决环境判断补丁，还能改进其他基于LLM的修复技术输出。

Conclusion: 程序分析驱动的解释有助于LLM代理在软件工程任务中的应用，推动代理AI方法发展。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents autonomously use external tools on top of
one or more LLMs to accomplish specific tasks. Lately LLM agents for software
engineering tasks have become popular. These agents can benefit from the use of
program analysis tools working on program representations. This is demonstrated
by existing agentic AI solutions such as AutoCodeRover or SpecRover which
perform automated program repair. Specifically the goal of these works is to
use program analysis to improve the patch quality. These agents are currently
being used to automatically fix static analysis issues from the widely used
SonarQube static analyzer.
  Nevertheless, for the agents to be deployed in a production environment,
agents need to suggest software artifacts, such as patches, with evidence and
with high confidence. In this work, we provide a workflow where an agent
provides explanations of the bug in the form of symbolic formulae. The
explanations are in the form of input conditions, infection conditions and
output conditions, implemented as property based tests (PBT) and
program-internal symbolic expressions. These can help in human developer
cognition of the agent outputs as well as in achieving completely automated
agentic workflows for software. The human developer can benefit from the input
condition, represented as a PBT, to generate various concrete inputs showing a
given issue. Furthermore, since the PBTs are executable, our explanations are
executable as well. We can thus also use the explanations in a completely
automated issue resolution environment for accepting or rejecting the patches
that are suggested by patching agents such as AutoCodeRover. Finally, as
agentic AI approaches continue to develop, the program analysis driven
explanations can be provided to other LLM-based repair techniques such as
Agentless to improve their output.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成模糊测试技术在资源调度和性能评估方面存在局限，导致资源浪费。

Result: 在Google的fuzzer - test - suite和真实开源项目上评估，Legion优于现有技术，在真实开源项目中检测到20个漏洞。

Conclusion: Legion能有效减少资源消耗，提升模糊测试效果，发现更多漏洞。

Abstract: Fuzzing is widely used for detecting bugs and vulnerabilities, with various
techniques proposed to enhance its effectiveness. To combine the advantages of
multiple technologies, researchers proposed ensemble fuzzing, which integrates
multiple base fuzzers. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art ensemble
fuzzing techniques face limitations in resource scheduling and performance
evaluation, leading to unnecessary resource waste. In this paper, we propose
Legion, a novel ensemble fuzzing framework that dynamically schedules resources
during the ensemble fuzzing campaign. We designed a novel resource scheduling
algorithm based on the upper confidence bound algorithm to reduce the resource
consumption of ineffective base fuzzers. Additionally, we introduce a
multidimensional seed evaluation strategy, which considers multiple metrics to
achieve more comprehensive fine-grained performance evaluation. We implemented
Legion as a prototype tool and evaluated its effectiveness on Google's
fuzzer-test-suite as well as real-world open-source projects. Results show that
Legion outperforms existing state-of-the-art base fuzzers and ensemble fuzzing
techniques, detecting 20 vulnerabilities in real-world open-source
projects-five previously unknown and three classified as CVEs.

Conclusion: madupite在求解大规模马尔可夫决策过程方面有显著进步，具有无与伦比的可扩展性和灵活性。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce and benchmark madupite, a newly proposed
high-performance solver designed for large-scale discounted infinite-horizon
Markov decision processes with finite state and action spaces. After a brief
overview of the class of mathematical optimization methods on which madupite
relies, we provide details on implementation choices, technical design and
deployment. We then demonstrate its scalability and efficiency by showcasing
its performance on the solution of Markov decision processes arising from
different application areas, including epidemiology and classical control.
Madupite sets a new standard as, to the best of our knowledge, it is the only
solver capable of efficiently computing exact solutions for large-scale Markov
decision processes, even when these exceed the memory capacity of modern
laptops and operate in near-undiscounted settings. This is possible as madupite
can work in a fully distributed manner and therefore leverage the memory
storage and computation capabilities of modern high-performance computing
clusters. This key feature enables the solver to efficiently handle problems of
medium to large size in an exact manner instead of necessarily resorting to
function approximations. Moreover, madupite is unique in allowing users to
customize the solution algorithm to better exploit the specific structure of
their problem, significantly accelerating convergence especially in
large-discount factor settings. Overall, madupite represents a significant
advancement, offering unmatched scalability and flexibility in solving
large-scale Markov decision processes.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) seeks to automatically correct software bugs
without requiring human intervention. However, existing tools tend to generate
patches that satisfy test cases without fixing the underlying bug, those are
known as overfitting patches. To address this issue, Automated Patch
Correctness Assessment (APCA) attempts to identify overfitting patches
generated by APR tools. It can be solved as a static approach, meaning that no
additional information is needed beyond the original and fixed code snippets.
Current static techniques often struggle with reliability, flexibility and
transparency. To address these issues, we introduce RePaCA, a novel static APCA
technique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in thinking
tasks. Our model is prompted with both buggy and fixed code snippets and guided
to generate a Chain of Thought that analyses code differences, reasons about
how the patch addresses the root cause, and ultimately provides a binary
classification: correct or overfitting. To enhance these reasoning capabilities
for the APCA task specifically, the LLM is finetuned using Reinforcement
Learning with the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm. When evaluated
on a standard Defects4J-derived test, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with 83.1% accuracy and an 84.8% F1-score. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates superior generalization capabilities when trained on different
datasets, outperforming the leading technique. This reasoning capability also
provides enhanced explainability for the patch assessment. These findings
underscore the considerable promise of finetuned, reasoning LLMs to advance
static APCA by enhancing accuracy, generalization, and explainability.

Abstract: Large language models and deep learning models designed for code intelligence
have revolutionized the software engineering field due to their ability to
perform various code-related tasks. These models can process source code and
software artifacts with high accuracy in tasks such as code completion, defect
detection, and code summarization; therefore, they can potentially become an
integral part of modern software engineering practices. Despite these
capabilities, robustness remains a critical quality attribute for deep-code
models as they may produce different results under varied and adversarial
conditions (e.g., variable renaming). Metamorphic testing has become a widely
used approach to evaluate models' robustness by applying semantic-preserving
transformations to input programs and analyzing the stability of model outputs.
While prior research has explored testing deep learning models, this systematic
literature review focuses specifically on metamorphic testing for deep code
models. By studying 45 primary papers, we analyze the transformations,
techniques, and evaluation methods used to assess robustness. Our review
summarizes the current landscape, identifying frequently evaluated models,
programming tasks, datasets, target languages, and evaluation metrics, and
highlights key challenges and future directions for advancing the field.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software
engineering has sparked interest in their use for software vulnerability
detection. However, the rapid development of this field has resulted in a
fragmented research landscape, with diverse studies that are difficult to
compare due to differences in, e.g., system designs and dataset usage. This
fragmentation makes it difficult to obtain a clear overview of the
state-of-the-art or compare and categorize studies meaningfully. In this work,
we present a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection. We analyze 227 studies published between
January 2020 and June 2025, categorizing them by task formulation, input
representation, system architecture, and adaptation techniques. Further, we
analyze the datasets used, including their characteristics, vulnerability
coverage, and diversity. We present a fine-grained taxonomy of vulnerability
detection approaches, identify key limitations, and outline actionable future
research opportunities. By providing a structured overview of the field, this
review improves transparency and serves as a practical guide for researchers
and practitioners aiming to conduct more comparable and reproducible research.
We publicly release all artifacts and maintain a living repository of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection studies.

Result: 系统在73%以上的场景中使机器人达成协议，平均协商时间0.67s，且协商方法具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: RobEthiChor方法可行、有效且可扩展，能实现基于伦理的协商。

Abstract: The presence of autonomous systems is growing at a fast pace and it is
impacting many aspects of our lives. Designed to learn and act independently,
these systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.
However, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which
are unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the
decision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous
systems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When
multiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must
negotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the
parties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous
systems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into
their decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a
domain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable
of ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an
implementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which
can be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation
capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real
robots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource
contention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness
of the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor allowed robots
to reach an agreement in more than 73\% of the scenarios with an acceptable
negotiation time (0.67s on average). Experiments also demonstrate that the
negotiation approach implemented in RobEthiChor is scalable.

Conclusion: KnowledgeMind多智能体系统能有效解决现有根因分析方法的问题，提高根因定位的准确性。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, due to the highly decoupled and flexible nature of
microservices, it poses greater challenges to system reliability. The more
frequent occurrence of incidents has created a demand for Root Cause
Analysis(RCA) methods that enable rapid identification and recovery of
incidents. Large language model (LLM) provides a new path for quickly locating
and recovering from incidents by leveraging their powerful generalization
ability combined with expert experience. Current LLM for RCA frameworks are
based on ideas like ReAct and Chain-of-Thought, but the hallucination of LLM
and the propagation nature of anomalies often lead to incorrect localization
results. Moreover, the massive amount of anomalous information generated in
large, complex systems presents a huge challenge for the context window length
of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose KnowledgeMind, an innovative
LLM multi-agent system based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and a knowledge base
reward mechanism for standardized service-by-service reasoning. Compared to
State-Of-The-Art(SOTA) LLM for RCA methods, our service-by-service exploration
approach significantly reduces the burden on the maximum context window length,
requiring only one-tenth of its size. Additionally, by incorporating a
rule-based real-time reward mechanism, our method effectively mitigates
hallucinations during the inference process. Compared to the SOTA LLM for RCA
framework, our method achieves a 49.29% to 128.35% improvement in root cause
localization accuracy.

Method: 提出Repair - R1，将测试用例引入训练阶段，提前测试生成，用RL共同优化测试生成和错误修复，用三种骨干模型实现。

Result: 在四个基准测试上，Repair - R1比原始模型修复成功率提高2.68% - 48.29%，测试生成成功率提高16.38% - 53.28%，测试覆盖率提高0.78% - 53.96%。

Conclusion: Repair - R1方法有效，代码和权重已发布。

Abstract: APR (Automated Program Repair) aims to automatically locate program defects,
generate patches and validate the repairs. Existing techniques for APR are
often combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the
code-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current
LLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference
stage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates
it through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two
important aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training
phase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address
this, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's
training phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is
required to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish
defective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables
the model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of
defects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with
three different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to
co-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely
adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1. Specially,
compared to vanilla models, Repair-R1 improves repair success rate by 2.68\% to
48.29\%, test generation success rate by 16.38\% to 53.28\%, and test coverage
by 0.78\% to 53.96\%. We publish the code and weights at

Motivation: 开放科学背景下研究成果可追溯性面临挑战，明确研究代码应被视为研究工件，但实施方式不明，需探究英国学术机构存储和注册软件情况。

Method: 搜索英国研究与创新署（UKRI）的研究网关（GtR）元数据，查找英国公共资助的研究软件。

Result: 软件作为研究成果报告数量与其他类别相比偏低；工件共享率低，四分之一报告的软件无链接，45%的URL缺失或错误；有效URL中最大类别是公共商业代码库，GitHub托管18%的公共资助研究软件。

Conclusion: 英国研究中工件共享不足，若不传播，研究软件可能沦为短暂工件，对研究软件维护和发展不利。

Abstract: Research software is crucial in the research process and the growth of Open
Science underscores the importance of accessing research artifacts, like data
and code, raising traceability challenges among outputs. While it is a clear
principle that research code, along with other essential outputs, should be
recognised as artifacts of the research process, the how of this principle
remains variable. This study examines where UK academic institutions store and
register software as a unique research output, searching the UKRI's Gateway to
Research (GtR) metadata for publicly funded research software in the UK. The
quantity of software reported as research outcomes remains low in proportion to
other categories. Artifact sharing appears low, with one-quarter of the
reported software having no links and 45% having either a missing or erroneous
URL. Of the valid URLs, we find the single largest category is Public
Commercial Code Repository, with GitHub being the host of 18% of all publicly
funded research software listed. These observations are contrasted with past
findings from 2023 and finally, we discuss the lack of artifact sharing in UK
research, with resulting implications for the maintenance and evolution of
research software. Without dissemination, research software risks demotion to a
transient artifact, useful only to meet short term research demands but
ultimately lost to the broader enterprise of science.

Result: 结构过滤在相关性和基于制度的指标上改善了方向信号清晰度，但因果激励强度提升有限，用交易事件计算的OBI与未来价格走势因果一致性更强。

Conclusion: 设计高频方向信号时，区分关联诊断和因果诊断很重要。

Abstract: With the advent of electronic capital markets and algorithmic trading agents,
the number of events in tick-by-tick market data has exploded. A large fraction
of these orders is transient. Their ephemeral character degrades the
informativeness of directional alphas derived from the limit order book (LOB)
state. We investigate whether directional signals such as order book imbalance
(OBI) can be improved by structurally filtering high-frequency LOB data. Three
real-time, observable filtration schemes: based on order lifetime, update
count, and inter-update delay. These are used to recompute OBI on structurally
filtered event streams. To assess the effect of filtration, we implement a
three-layer diagnostic framework: contemporaneous correlation with returns,
explanatory power under discretized regime counts, and causal coherence via
Hawkes excitation norms. Empirical results show that structural filtration
improves directional signal clarity in correlation and regime-based metrics,
but leads to only limited gains in causal excitation strength. In contrast, OBI
computed using trade events exhibits stronger causal alignment with future
price movements. These findings highlight the importance of differentiating
between associative and causal diagnostics when designing high-frequency
directional signals.

Conclusion: 为实际数据集成问题中的方法选择提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Modern data analysis increasingly requires identifying shared latent
structure across multiple high-dimensional datasets. A commonly used model
assumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with
a shared singular subspace. In this case, two primary methods have emerged for
estimating this shared structure, which vary in how they integrate information
across datasets. The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the
datasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second
approach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset,
then aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally
computes a consensus amongst them. While these methods are widely used, they
have not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which
is of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and
dimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty
about which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their
potential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the
asymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop
optimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods. Our analysis reveals
that while neither method uniformly dominates the other in the unweighted case,
optimally weighted Stack-SVD dominates optimally weighted SVD-Stack. We extend
our analysis to accommodate multiple shared components, and provide practical
algorithms for estimating optimal weights from data, offering theoretical
guidance for method selection in practical data integration problems. Extensive
numerical simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on genomic data
corroborate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic framework, termed LVM-GP, for uncertainty
quantification in solving forward and inverse partial differential equations
(PDEs) with noisy data. The core idea is to construct a stochastic mapping from
the input to a high-dimensional latent representation, enabling
uncertainty-aware prediction of the solution. Specifically, the architecture
consists of a confidence-aware encoder and a probabilistic decoder. The encoder
implements a high-dimensional latent variable model based on a Gaussian process
(LVM-GP), where the latent representation is constructed by interpolating
between a learnable deterministic feature and a Gaussian process prior, with
the interpolation strength adaptively controlled by a confidence function
learned from data. The decoder defines a conditional Gaussian distribution over
the solution field, where the mean is predicted by a neural operator applied to
the latent representation, allowing the model to learn flexible
function-to-function mapping. Moreover, physical laws are enforced as soft
constraints in the loss function to ensure consistency with the underlying PDE
structure. Compared to existing approaches such as Bayesian physics-informed
neural networks (B-PINNs) and deep ensembles, the proposed framework can
efficiently capture functional dependencies via merging a latent Gaussian
process and neural operator, resulting in competitive predictive accuracy and
robust uncertainty quantification. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and reliability of the method.

Abstract: Domain adaptation seeks to leverage the abundant label information in a
source domain to improve classification performance in a target domain with
limited labels. While the field has seen extensive methodological development,
its theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. Most existing
theoretical analyses focus on simplified settings where the source and target
domains share the same input space and relate target-domain performance to
measures of domain discrepancy. Although insightful, these analyses may not
fully capture the behavior of modern approaches that align domains into a
shared space via feature transformations. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive theoretical study of domain adaptation algorithms based on domain
alignment. We consider the joint learning of domain-aligning feature
transformations and a shared classifier in a semi-supervised setting. We first
derive generalization bounds in a broad setting, in terms of covering numbers
of the relevant function classes. We then extend our analysis to characterize
the sample complexity of domain-adaptive neural networks employing maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) or adversarial objectives. Our results rely on a rigorous
analysis of the covering numbers of these architectures. We show that, for both
MMD-based and adversarial models, the sample complexity admits an upper bound
that scales quadratically with network depth and width. Furthermore, our
analysis suggests that in semi-supervised settings, robustness to limited
labeled target data can be achieved by scaling the target loss proportionally
to the square root of the number of labeled target samples. Experimental
evaluation in both shallow and deep settings lends support to our theoretical
findings.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of machine learning tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature
learning through deep architectures. However, the large number of layers and
millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train,
requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures.
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that
integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our
approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance
sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We
further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly
into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This
integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but
also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several
fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN
variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive
performance and training speed.

Abstract: Machine and deep learning have grown in popularity and use in biological
research over the last decade but still present challenges in interpretability
of the fitted model. The development and use of metrics to determine features
driving predictions and increase model interpretability continues to be an open
area of research. We investigate the use of Shapley Additive Explanations
(SHAP) on a multi-view deep learning model applied to multi-omics data for the
purposes of identifying biomolecules of interest. Rankings of features via
these attribution methods are compared across various architectures to evaluate
consistency of the method. We perform multiple computational experiments to
assess the robustness of SHAP and investigate modeling approaches and
diagnostics to increase and measure the reliability of the identification of
important features. Accuracy of a random-forest model fit on subsets of
features selected as being most influential as well as clustering quality using
only these features are used as a measure of effectiveness of the attribution
method. Our findings indicate that the rankings of features resulting from SHAP
are sensitive to the choice of architecture as well as different random
initializations of weights, suggesting caution when using attribution methods
on multi-view deep learning models applied to multi-omics data. We present an
alternative, simple method to assess the robustness of identification of
important biomolecules.

Abstract: Probabilistic machine learning models are distinguished by their ability to
integrate prior knowledge of noise statistics, smoothness parameters, and
training data uncertainty. A common approach involves modeling data with
Gaussian processes; however, their computational complexity quickly becomes
intractable as the training dataset grows. To address this limitation, we
introduce a quantum-assisted algorithm for sparse Gaussian process regression
based on the random Fourier feature kernel approximation. We start by encoding
the data matrix into a quantum state using a multi-controlled unitary
operation, which encodes the classical representation of the random Fourier
features matrix used for kernel approximation. We then employ a quantum
principal component analysis along with a quantum phase estimation technique to
extract the spectral decomposition of the kernel matrix. We apply a conditional
rotation operator to the ancillary qubit based on the eigenvalue. We then use
Hadamard and swap tests to compute the mean and variance of the posterior
Gaussian distribution. We achieve a polynomial-order computational speedup
relative to the classical method.

TL;DR: 现有智能合约漏洞检测方法有局限，提出基于LLM的SAEL框架，结合多种技术，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能合约漏洞检测方法存在局限性，通用大语言模型有适应新漏洞模式的能力但特定漏洞检测表现不佳，需结合其生成解释提升检测性能。

Method: 设计目标提示引导LLM识别漏洞和生成解释作为特征；对CodeT5和T5进行提示调优；引入自适应专家混合架构，通过门控网络调整特征权重，结合多头自注意力机制；采用梯度优化整合多种特征，损失函数兼顾独立特征性能和整体加权预测。

Result: 实验显示SAEL在各种漏洞检测上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAEL框架能有效结合多种特征进行智能合约漏洞检测，性能表现更优。

Abstract: With the increasing security issues in blockchain, smart contract
vulnerability detection has become a research focus. Existing vulnerability
detection methods have their limitations: 1) Static analysis methods struggle
with complex scenarios. 2) Methods based on specialized pre-trained models
perform well on specific datasets but have limited generalization capabilities.
In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate
impressive ability in adapting to new vulnerability patterns. However, they
often underperform on specific vulnerability types compared to methods based on
specialized pre-trained models. We also observe that explanations generated by
general-purpose LLMs can provide fine-grained code understanding information,
contributing to improved detection performance.
  Inspired by these observations, we propose SAEL, an LLM-based framework for
smart contract vulnerability detection. We first design targeted prompts to
guide LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities and generating explanations, which
serve as prediction features. Next, we apply prompt-tuning on CodeT5 and T5 to
process contract code and explanations, enhancing task-specific performance. To
combine the strengths of each approach, we introduce an Adaptive
Mixture-of-Experts architecture. This dynamically adjusts feature weights via a
Gating Network, which selects relevant features using TopK filtering and
Softmax normalization, and incorporates a Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism
to enhance cross-feature relationships. This design enables effective
integration of LLM predictions, explanation features, and code features through
gradient optimization. The loss function jointly considers both independent
feature performance and overall weighted predictions. Experiments show that
SAEL outperforms existing methods across various vulnerabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在关键领域应用增加，需确保其抵御越狱攻击的安全性，传统防御方法无法应对新型攻击。

Method: 提出战略转移（SDeflection）防御策略，使模型生成语义相近但去除有害意图的回答。

Result: 实验表明 SDeflection 显著降低攻击成功率，同时在良性查询上保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 防御策略从简单拒绝转向战略内容转移以应对高级威胁是关键转变。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in critical areas,
ensuring their security against jailbreaking attacks is paramount. While
traditional defenses primarily rely on refusing malicious prompts, recent
logit-level attacks have demonstrated the ability to bypass these safeguards by
directly manipulating the token-selection process during generation. We
introduce Strategic Deflection (SDeflection), a defense that redefines the
LLM's response to such advanced attacks. Instead of outright refusal, the model
produces an answer that is semantically adjacent to the user's request yet
strips away the harmful intent, thereby neutralizing the attacker's harmful
intent. Our experiments demonstrate that SDeflection significantly lowers
Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining model performance on benign
queries. This work presents a critical shift in defensive strategies, moving
from simple refusal to strategic content redirection to neutralize advanced
threats.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks aim to exploit large language models (LLMs) by inducing
them to generate harmful content, thereby revealing their vulnerabilities.
Understanding and addressing these attacks is crucial for advancing the field
of LLM safety. Previous jailbreak approaches have mainly focused on direct
manipulations of harmful intent, with limited attention to the impact of
persona prompts. In this study, we systematically explore the efficacy of
persona prompts in compromising LLM defenses. We propose a genetic
algorithm-based method that automatically crafts persona prompts to bypass
LLM's safety mechanisms. Our experiments reveal that: (1) our evolved persona
prompts reduce refusal rates by 50-70% across multiple LLMs, and (2) these
prompts demonstrate synergistic effects when combined with existing attack
methods, increasing success rates by 10-20%. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: The increasing digitization of smart grids has improved operational
efficiency but also introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) targeting Automatic Generation Control (AGC)
systems. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown
promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator
trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that
integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language
explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as
LightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s
inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs,
including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate
human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o
mini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack
target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and
2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These
results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time
detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical
need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.

Abstract: Permission analysis is a widely used method for Android malware detection. It
involves examining the permissions requested by an application to access
sensitive data or perform potentially malicious actions. In recent years,
various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to Android malware
detection using permission-based features and feature selection techniques,
often achieving high accuracy. However, these studies have largely overlooked
important factors such as protection levels and the deprecation or restriction
of permissions due to updates in the Android OS -- factors that can contribute
to concept drift.
  In this study, we investigate the impact of deprecated and restricted
permissions on the performance of machine learning models. A large dataset
containing 166 permissions was used, encompassing more than 70,000 malware and
benign applications. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms were
employed as classifiers, along with different concept drift detection
strategies. The results suggest that Android permissions are highly effective
features for malware detection, with the exclusion of deprecated and restricted
permissions having only a marginal impact on model performance. In some cases,
such as with CNN, accuracy improved. Excluding these permissions also enhanced
the detection of concept drift using a year-to-year analysis strategy. Dataset
balancing further improved model performance, reduced low-accuracy instances,
and enhanced concept drift detection via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

Motivation: 随着网络应用和云服务扩张，恶意JavaScript代码威胁大，但因代码混淆和语言特性，检测困难。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的去混淆有效，建模聚类级关系对检测恶意代码很重要。

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of web-based applications and cloud services,
malicious JavaScript code continues to pose significant threats to user
privacy, system integrity, and enterprise security. But, detecting such threats
remains challenging due to sophisticated code obfuscation techniques and
JavaScript's inherent language characteristics, particularly its nested closure
structures and syntactic flexibility. In this work, we propose DeCoda, a hybrid
defense framework that combines large language model (LLM)-based deobfuscation
with code graph learning: (1) We first construct a sophisticated
prompt-learning pipeline with multi-stage refinement, where the LLM
progressively reconstructs the original code structure from obfuscated inputs
and then generates normalized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations; (2)
In JavaScript ASTs, dynamic typing scatters semantically similar nodes while
deeply nested functions fracture scope capturing, introducing structural noise
and semantic ambiguity. To address these challenges, we then propose to learn
hierarchical code graph representations via a Cluster-wise Graph that
synergistically integrates graph transformer network, node clustering, and
node-to-cluster attention to simultaneously capture both local node-level
semantics and global cluster-induced structural relationships from AST graph.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves F1-scores of 94.64%
and 97.71% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating absolute improvements of
10.74% and 13.85% over state-of-the-art baselines. In false-positive control
evaluation at fixed FPR levels (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01), our approach delivers
4.82, 5.91, and 2.53 higher TPR respectively compared to the best-performing
baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-based deobfuscation
and underscore the importance of modeling cluster-level relationships in
detecting malicious code.

Abstract: Despite outstanding results, machine learning-based Android malware detection
models struggle with concept drift, where rapidly evolving malware
characteristics degrade model effectiveness. This study examines the impact of
concept drift on Android malware detection, evaluating two datasets and nine
machine learning and deep learning algorithms, as well as Large Language Models
(LLMs). Various feature types--static, dynamic, hybrid, semantic, and
image-based--were considered. The results showed that concept drift is
widespread and significantly affects model performance. Factors influencing the
drift include feature types, data environments, and detection methods.
Balancing algorithms helped with class imbalance but did not fully address
concept drift, which primarily stems from the dynamic nature of the malware
landscape. No strong link was found between the type of algorithm used and
concept drift, the impact was relatively minor compared to other variables
since hyperparameters were not fine-tuned, and the default algorithm
configurations were used. While LLMs using few-shot learning demonstrated
promising detection performance, they did not fully mitigate concept drift,
highlighting the need for further investigation.

Abstract: Multi-period mean-variance optimization is a long-standing problem, caused by
the failure of dynamic programming principle. This paper studies the
mean-variance optimization in a setting of finite-horizon discrete-time Markov
decision processes (MDPs), where the objective is to maximize the combined
metrics of mean and variance of the accumulated rewards at terminal stage. By
introducing the concepts of pseudo mean and pseudo variance, we convert the
original mean-variance MDP to a bilevel MDP, where the outer is a single
parameter optimization of the pseudo mean and the inner is a standard
finite-horizon MDP with an augmented state space by adding an auxiliary state
of accumulated rewards. We further study the properties of this bilevel MDP,
including the optimality of history-dependent deterministic policies and the
piecewise quadratic concavity of the inner MDPs' optimal values with respect to
the pseudo mean. To efficiently solve this bilevel MDP, we propose an iterative
algorithm that alternatingly updates the inner optimal policy and the outer
pseudo mean. We prove that this algorithm converges to a local optimum. We also
derive a sufficient condition under which our algorithm converges to the global
optimum. Furthermore, we apply this approach to study the mean-variance
optimization of multi-period portfolio selection problem, which shows that our
approach exactly coincides with the classical result by Li and Ng (2000) in
financial engineering. Our approach builds a new avenue to solve mean-variance
optimization problems and has wide applicability to any problem modeled by
MDPs, which is further demonstrated by examples of mean-variance optimization
for queueing control and inventory management.

Abstract: Given a controlled diffusion and a connected, bounded, Lipschitz set, when is
it possible to guarantee controlled set invariance with probability one? In
this work, we answer this question by deriving the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the same in terms of gradients of certain log-likelihoods --
a.k.a. score vector fields -- for two cases: given finite time horizon and
infinite time horizon. The deduced conditions comprise a score-based test that
provably certifies or falsifies the existence of Markovian controllers for
given controlled set invariance problem data. Our results are constructive in
the sense when the problem data passes the proposed test, we characterize all
controllers guaranteeing the desired set invariance. When the problem data
fails the proposed test, there does not exist a controller that can accomplish
the desired set invariance with probability one. The computation in the
proposed tests involve solving certain Dirichlet boundary value problems, and
in the finite horizon case, can also account for additional constraint of
hitting a target subset at the terminal time. We illustrate the results using
several semi-analytical and numerical examples.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative
model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy.
However, existing FL algorithms predominantly focus on unconstrained
optimization problems with exact gradient information, limiting its
applicability in scenarios where only noisy function evaluations are accessible
or where model parameters are constrained. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel zeroth-order projection-based algorithm on Riemannian manifolds
for FL. By leveraging the projection operator, we introduce a computationally
efficient zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator. Unlike existing
estimators, ours requires only a simple Euclidean random perturbation,
eliminating the need to sample random vectors in the tangent space, thus
reducing computational cost. Theoretically, we first prove the approximation
properties of the estimator and then establish the sublinear convergence of the
proposed algorithm, matching the rate of its first-order counterpart.
Numerically, we first assess the efficiency of our estimator using kernel
principal component analysis. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to
two real-world scenarios: zeroth-order attacks on deep neural networks and
low-rank neural network training to validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining
actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been
at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance,
it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those
introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This
may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired
by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in
CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent
pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain
generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a
multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias.
Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function
applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby
enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied
to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe
that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while
retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.

sets for neural networks. This is especially relevant for financial time
series, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the
historical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data
availability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative
adversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not
exhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a
certain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we
investigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs
can help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed
of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two
approaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the
quantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods.
We tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond
dimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series. The QGAN that
we trained generate synthetic financial time series that not only match the
target distribution but also exhibit the desired temporal correlations, with
the quality of each property depending on the hyperparameters and simulation
method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究单位圆上相互作用粒子的平均场模型的全局同步问题，解决自注意力动力学的猜想。

Method: 提出基于粒子相互作用函数三阶导数的L1 - 范数的通用同步准则。

Result: 证明对于所有β ≥ - 0.16时同步成立，扩展了之前的范围；证明当β < - 2/3时全局同步不发生。

Conclusion: 提出的同步准则有效，解决了自注意力动力学的猜想并明确了不同β值下的同步特性。

Abstract: This paper considers a mean-field model of $n$ interacting particles whose
state space is the unit circle, a generalization of the classical Kuramoto
model. Global synchronization is said to occur if after starting from almost
any initial state, all particles coalesce to a common point on the circle. We
propose a general synchronization criterion in terms of $L_1$-norm of the third
derivative of the particle interaction function. As an application we resolve a
conjecture for the so-called self-attention dynamics (stylized model of
transformers), by showing synchronization for all $\beta \ge -0.16$, which
significantly extends the previous bound of $0\le \beta \le 1$ from
Criscitiello, Rebjock, McRae, and Boumal (2024). We also show that global
synchronization does not occur when $\beta < -2/3$.

TL;DR: 现有视觉数据的去学习方法难以处理音频信号，本文提出量子启发的音频去学习框架QPAudioEraser，经评估性能优越，能有效擦除目标数据并保留模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音认证和音频生物识别系统增加隐私风险，现有视觉数据去学习方法无法有效处理音频信号，需新方法满足隐私法规。

Method: 引入QPAudioEraser框架，包括用破坏性干扰初始化权重、基于叠加的标签转换、不确定性最大化的量子损失函数和纠缠启发的权重混合。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上评估，能完全擦除目标数据（遗忘准确率0%），对保留数据性能影响小至0.05%，超越传统基线。

Conclusion: QPAudioEraser是一个强大的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of voice-enabled authentication and audio biometric
systems have significantly increased privacy vulnerabilities associated with
sensitive speech data. Compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR's right
to be forgotten and India's DPDP Act necessitates targeted and efficient
erasure of individual-specific voice signatures from already-trained biometric
models. Existing unlearning methods designed for visual data inadequately
handle the sequential, temporal, and high-dimensional nature of audio signals,
leading to ineffective or incomplete speaker and accent erasure. To address
this, we introduce QPAudioEraser, a quantum-inspired audio unlearning
framework. Our our-phase approach involves: (1) weight initialization using
destructive interference to nullify target features, (2) superposition-based
label transformations that obscure class identity, (3) an
uncertainty-maximizing quantum loss function, and (4) entanglement-inspired
mixing of correlated weights to retain model knowledge. Comprehensive
evaluations with ResNet18, ViT, and CNN architectures across AudioMNIST, Speech
Commands, LibriSpeech, and Speech Accent Archive datasets validate
QPAudioEraser's superior performance. The framework achieves complete erasure
of target data (0% Forget Accuracy) while incurring minimal impact on model
utility, with a performance degradation on retained data as low as 0.05%.
QPAudioEraser consistently surpasses conventional baselines across
single-class, multi-class, sequential, and accent-level erasure scenarios,
establishing the proposed approach as a robust privacy-preserving solution.

Motivation: 现有自回归TTS模型的对齐易出错，非自回归模型依赖外部时长信息，有局限性

Method: 提出能根据给定文本给出折中的音素级时长分布的时长预测框架

Result: 相比基线模型，预测更精确，有更好的条件适应能力，对齐准确率提升约11.3%，使零样本TTS模型性能更稳健

Conclusion: 所提框架在语音文本对齐方面表现良好，能提升TTS模型性能

Abstract: Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural text to-speech
(TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to
learn these alignments on-line. However, these alignments tend to be brittle
and often fail to generalize to long utterances and out-of-domain text, leading
to missing or repeating words. Most non-autoregressive end to-end TTS models
rely on durations extracted from external sources, using additional duration
models for alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel duration prediction
framework that can give compromising phoneme-level duration distribution with
given text. In our experiments, the proposed duration model has more precise
prediction and condition adaptation ability compared to previous baseline
models. Numerically, it has roughly a 11.3 percents immprovement on alignment
accuracy, and makes the performance of zero-shot TTS models more robust to the
mismatch between prompt audio and input audio.

TL;DR: 本文提出AI驱动框架生成视觉刺激，通过三个实验研究感知比较对真实物体记忆扭曲的影响，发现相似维度会引发记忆扭曲，视觉维度更易扭曲。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究虽有感知比较后记忆扭曲的报道，但理解其对真实物体记忆扭曲的影响及确定哪些视觉特征导致记忆易损性仍是挑战。

Method: 提出AI驱动框架生成自然主义视觉刺激，用图像轮和维度轮两种刺激，进行三个视觉工作记忆实验，评估三种条件下的记忆扭曲。

Result: 相似维度和相似图像一样会引发记忆扭曲，视觉维度比语义维度更易扭曲。

Conclusion: 自然主义视觉刺激的物体维度在记忆易损性中起重要作用。

Abstract: Human memory exhibits significant vulnerability in cognitive tasks and daily
life. Comparisons between visual working memory and new perceptual input (e.g.,
during cognitive tasks) can lead to unintended memory distortions. Previous
studies have reported systematic memory distortions after perceptual
comparison, but understanding how perceptual comparison affects memory
distortions in real-world objects remains a challenge. Furthermore, identifying
what visual features contribute to memory vulnerability presents a novel
research question. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven framework that generates
naturalistic visual stimuli grounded in behaviorally relevant object dimensions
to elicit similarity-induced memory biases. We use two types of stimuli --
image wheels created through dimension editing and dimension wheels generated
by dimension activation values -- in three visual working memory (VWM)
experiments. These experiments assess memory distortions under three
conditions: no perceptual comparison, perceptual comparison with image wheels,
and perceptual comparison with dimension wheels. The results show that similar
dimensions, like similar images, can also induce memory distortions.
Specifically, visual dimensions are more prone to distortion than semantic
dimensions, indicating that the object dimensions of naturalistic visual
stimuli play a significant role in the vulnerability of memory.

Motivation: 当前神经科学常通过关联神经表征与计算模型学习的内部表征来理解系统，但机器学习中特征表示可能存在偏差，影响对系统的全面理解，因此要研究此偏差带来的挑战。

Method: 说明特征表示偏差如何导致常见分析（如PCA、回归和RSA）产生强偏差推断，以同态加密为例研究表征模式与计算之间的强分离可能性。

Result: 揭示了特征表示偏差会使常见分析产生偏差推断，展示了表征模式与计算可能存在强分离。

Conclusion: 讨论了这些结果对系统间表征比较以及神经科学的影响。

Abstract: A common approach in neuroscience is to study neural representations as a
means to understand a system -- increasingly, by relating the neural
representations to the internal representations learned by computational
models. However, a recent work in machine learning (Lampinen, 2024) shows that
learned feature representations may be biased to over-represent certain
features, and represent others more weakly and less-consistently. For example,
simple (linear) features may be more strongly and more consistently represented
than complex (highly nonlinear) features. These biases could pose challenges
for achieving full understanding of a system through representational analysis.
In this perspective, we illustrate these challenges -- showing how feature
representation biases can lead to strongly biased inferences from common
analyses like PCA, regression, and RSA. We also present homomorphic encryption
as a simple case study of the potential for strong dissociation between
patterns of representation and computation. We discuss the implications of
these results for representational comparisons between systems, and for
neuroscience more generally.

Motivation: 抑郁症和自杀倾向对认知和情绪有深远影响，但缺乏客观神经生理生物标志物，需探究其神经机制。

Method: 对137名参与者进行句子评估任务并记录EEG数据，采用多元解码分析。

Result: 识别出语义处理的神经特征，临床组相比健康对照组有更早开始、更长持续时间、更大幅度的解码反应等。

Conclusion: 临床组对情感显著内容敏感性改变且脱离能力受损，为开发基于EEG的生物标志物提供依据。

Abstract: Depression and suicidality profoundly impact cognition and emotion, yet
objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain elusive. We investigated the
spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying affective semantic processing in
individuals with varying levels of clinical severity of depression and
suicidality using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data.
Participants (N=137) completed a sentence evaluation task involving emotionally
charged self-referential statements while EEG was recorded. We identified
robust, neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy
between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with automatic semantic evaluation
and conflict monitoring. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with
depression and suicidality showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater
amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization
and increased activation of frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These
findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from
emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding
of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and providing a principled basis
for developing reliable EEG-based biomarkers of depression and suicidality.

TL;DR: 提出GABRIL方法解决模仿学习因果混淆问题，在Atari和CARLA环境验证，效果优于基线且具额外可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习常受因果混淆影响，在分布偏移测试环境表现不佳

Method: 引入GABRIL方法，利用人类注视数据引导表征学习，使用正则化损失聚焦因果相关特征

Result: 在Atari环境比行为克隆提升约179%，在CARLA环境提升76%

Conclusion: GABRIL方法有效，相比常规模仿学习代理有额外可解释性

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to
learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised
learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents
misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor
performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this
issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a
novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data
collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a
regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant
features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects
of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and
the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and
applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the
improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same
number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we
show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL
agents.

Conclusion: 所提简单因果结构学习框架可有效提升复杂模仿学习算法的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent developments in imitation learning have considerably advanced robotic
manipulation. However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from
poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain
shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of
complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the
training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by
observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly
learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert
actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural
function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.
Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to
satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we
theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal
relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning
framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning
architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our
approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco,
and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem
of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.

Motivation: 安全验证方法对自动驾驶系统安全部署和运行至关重要，现有场景参数PDF估计方法存在假设引入误差或模型简化等问题，需更好方法。

Method: 使用归一化流（NF）估计参数PDF，将其与传统非参数PDF估计方法核密度估计（KDE）对比。

Result: NF虽比KDE需要更多计算资源，但对维数灾难不敏感，能改善风险不确定性估计，更精确评估自动驾驶系统安全性。

Conclusion: NF在基于场景的安全评估中有潜力，未来需进一步实验优化以增强适用性。

Abstract: The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe
deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals
of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing
with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,
where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a
quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios
must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is
expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions
about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while
avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited
parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF
of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple
base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and
differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation
without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,
comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional
method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational
resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.
As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more
precise assessment of an ADS's safety.
  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future
work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and
optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training
hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.

Result: 在回合制追逃游戏实验中，GGPI算法能产生高回报交互和一次性策略迁移，在更多初始条件下成功率更高、路径效率更好。

Conclusion: GGPI算法可实现跨游戏学习值和策略的迁移，在游戏知识迁移方面表现良好。

Abstract: This paper explores successor features for knowledge transfer in zero-sum,
complete-information, and turn-based games. Prior research in single-agent
systems has shown that successor features can provide a ``jump start" for
agents when facing new tasks with varying reward structures. However, knowledge
transfer in games typically relies on value and equilibrium transfers, which
heavily depends on the similarity between tasks. This reliance can lead to
failures when the tasks differ significantly. To address this issue, this paper
presents an application of successor features to games and presents a novel
algorithm called Game Generalized Policy Improvement (GGPI), designed to
address Markov games in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed
algorithm enables the transfer of learning values and policies across games. An
upper bound of the errors for transfer is derived as a function the similarity
of the task. Through experiments with a turn-based pursuer-evader game, we
demonstrate that the GGPI algorithm can generate high-reward interactions and
one-shot policy transfer. When further tested in a wider set of initial
conditions, the GGPI algorithm achieves higher success rates with improved path
efficiency compared to those of the baseline algorithms.

Conclusion: Cloud -> AI -> Agent -> Trust转变是自主系统的下一个架构层。

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) proliferate in
high-stakes domains -- from pharmaceuticals to legal workflows -- the challenge
is no longer just intelligence, but verifiability. We introduce TrustTrack, a
protocol that embeds structural guarantees -- verifiable identity, policy
commitments, and tamper-resistant behavioral logs -- directly into agent
infrastructure. This enables a new systems paradigm: trust-native autonomy. By
treating compliance as a design constraint rather than post-hoc oversight,
TrustTrack reframes how intelligent agents operate across organizations and
jurisdictions. We present the protocol design, system requirements, and use
cases in regulated domains such as pharmaceutical R&D, legal automation, and
AI-native collaboration. We argue that the Cloud -> AI -> Agent -> Trust
transition represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Many people learn programming independently from online resources and often
report struggles in achieving their personal learning goals. Learners
frequently describe their experiences as isolating and frustrating, challenged
by abundant uncertainties, information overload, and distraction, compounded by
limited guidance. At the same time, social media serves as a personal space
where many engage in diverse self-regulation practices, including help-seeking,
using external memory aids (e.g., self-notes), self-reflection, emotion
regulation, and self-motivation. For instance, learners often mark achievements
and set milestones through their posts. In response, we developed a system
consisting of a web platform and browser extensions to support self-regulation
online. The design aims to add learner-defined structure to otherwise
unstructured experiences and bring meaning to curation and reflection
activities by translating them into learning stories with AI-generated
feedback. We position storytelling as an integrative approach to design that
connects resource curation, reflective and sensemaking practice, and narrative
practices learners already use across social platforms. We recruited 15
informal programming learners who are regular social media users to engage with
the system in a self-paced manner; participation concluded upon submitting a
learning story and survey. We used three quantitative scales and a qualitative
survey to examine users' characteristics and perceptions of the system's
support for their self-regulation. User feedback suggests the system's
viability as a self-regulation aid. Learners particularly valued in-situ
reflection, automated story feedback, and video annotation, while other
features received mixed views. We highlight perceived benefits, friction
points, and design opportunities for future AI-augmented self-regulation tools.

Conclusion: VRISE降低了认知和身体负担，证明沉浸式数字环境可提升测量教育，扩大参与度并强化核心能力。

Abstract: Surveying is a core component of civil engineering education, requiring
students to engage in hands-on spatial measurement, instrumentation handling,
and field-based decision-making. However, traditional instruction often poses
logistical and cognitive challenges that can hinder accessibility and student
engagement. While virtual laboratories have gained traction in engineering
education, few are purposefully designed to support flexible, adaptive learning
in surveying. To address this gap, we developed Virtual Reality for Immersive
and Interactive Surveying Education (VRISE), an immersive virtual reality
laboratory that replicates ground-based and aerial surveying tasks through
customizable, accessible, and user-friendly modules. VRISE features interactive
experiences such as differential leveling with a digital level equipment and
waypoint-based drone navigation, enhanced by input smoothing, adaptive
interfaces, and real-time feedback to accommodate diverse learning styles.
Evaluation across multiple user sessions demonstrated consistent gains in
measurement accuracy, task efficiency, and interaction quality, with a clear
progression in skill development across the ground-based and aerial surveying
modalities. By reducing cognitive load and physical demands, even in tasks
requiring fine motor control and spatial reasoning, VRISE demonstrates the
potential of immersive, repeatable digital environments to enhance surveying
education, broaden participation, and strengthen core competencies in a safe
and engaging setting.

Conclusion: 未提及。

Abstract: Generative AI, including large language models (LLMs) have the potential --
and already are being used -- to increase the speed, scale, and types of unsafe
conversations online. LLMs lower the barrier for entry for bad actors to create
unsafe conversations in particular because of their ability to generate
persuasive and human-like text. In our current work, we explore ways to promote
online safety by teaching people about unsafe conversations that can occur
online with and without LLMs. We build on prior work that shows that LLMs can
successfully simulate scam conversations. We also leverage research in the
learning sciences that shows that providing feedback on one's hypothetical
actions can promote learning. In particular, we focus on simulating scam
conversations using LLMs. Our work incorporates two LLMs that converse with
each other to simulate realistic, unsafe conversations that people may
encounter online between a scammer LLM and a target LLM but users of our system

Result: 模型有可量化的无序材料结构特性，记忆容量高于二元网络，记忆容量与配位数有缩放关系。

Conclusion: 联想记忆机制与非晶固体物理在连续取向自由度系统中有联系。

Abstract: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model
inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are
replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$.
The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix
through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian
matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits
quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials:
energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random
configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations
encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and
order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N
\cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a
fully-connected network) compared to binary networks ($\gamma_c \approx 0.138$)
and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between
associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in
systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the
scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim
(Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which
closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D
central-force spring networks.

Motivation: 解决数据科学应用中高维变量共享信号检测问题，克服采样噪声影响。

Method: 使用随机矩阵理论方法，考虑三种不同协方差矩阵。

Result: 三种协方差矩阵均出现预期相变，联合和交叉协方差矩阵更早重构信号，哪种方法更好取决于变量维度不匹配情况。

Conclusion: 为选择检测线性相关性的方法提供依据，探讨了向非线性统计依赖推广的可能性。

Abstract: Many data-science applications involve detecting a shared signal between two
high-dimensional variables. Using random matrix theory methods, we determine
when such signal can be detected and reconstructed from sample correlations,
despite the background of sampling noise induced correlations. We consider
three different covariance matrices constructed from two high-dimensional
variables: their individual self covariance, their cross covariance, and the
self covariance of the concatenated (joint) variable, which incorporates the
self and the cross correlation blocks. We observe the expected Baik, Ben Arous,
and P\'ech\'e detectability phase transition in all these covariance matrices,
and we show that joint and cross covariance matrices always reconstruct the
shared signal earlier than the self covariances. Whether the joint or the cross
approach is better depends on the mismatch of dimensionalities between the
variables. We discuss what these observations mean for choosing the right
method for detecting linear correlations in data and how these findings may
generalize to nonlinear statistical dependencies.

Motivation: 探讨能否高效近似求解n维正负Hopfield模型基态自由能问题。

Method: 提出CLuP±Hop算法，利用完全提升随机对偶理论（fl RDT）刻画其典型动态。

Result: CLuP±Hop在n小至几千时能得到正、负Hopfield模型基态自由能，同时在6级提升时得到对应理论热力学极限；发现两个模型近最优配置的差异。

Conclusion: 确定Hopfield模型近基态能量通常是简单问题，且正、负Hopfield模型存在本质差异。

Abstract: We study algorithmic aspects of finding $n$-dimensional \emph{positive} and
\emph{negative} Hopfield ($\pm$Hop) model ground state free energies. This
corresponds to classical maximization of random positive/negative semi-definite
quadratic forms over binary $\left \{\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \right \}^n$
vectors. The key algorithmic question is whether these problems can be
computationally efficiently approximated within a factor $\approx 1$. Following
the introduction and success of \emph{Controlled Loosening-up} (CLuP-SK)
algorithms in finding near ground state energies of closely related
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models [82], we here propose a CLuP$\pm$Hop
counterparts for $\pm$Hop models. Fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT)
[78] is utilized to characterize CLuP$\pm$Hop \emph{typical} dynamics. An
excellent agreement between practical performance and theoretical predictions
is observed. In particular, for $n$ as small as few thousands CLuP$\pm$Hop
achieve $\sim 1.77$ and $\sim 0.33$ as the ground state free energies of the
positive and negative Hopfield models. At the same time we obtain on the 6th
level of lifting (6-spl RDT) corresponding theoretical thermodynamic
($n\rightarrow\infty$) limits $\approx 1.7784$ and $\approx 0.3281$. This
positions determining Hopfield models near ground state energies as
\emph{typically} easy problems. Moreover, the very same 6th lifting level
evaluations allow to uncover a fundamental intrinsic difference between two
models: $+$Hop's near optimal configurations are \emph{typically close} to each
other whereas the $-$Hop's are \emph{typically far away}.

Result: 通过实验评估展示了OpenRASE在动态网络条件下的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: OpenRASE可用于探索SFC资源分配算法，测量真实CPU使用和延迟。

Abstract: Service Function Chains (SFCs) are one of the key enablers in providing
programmable computer networks, paving the way for network autonomy. However,
this also introduces new challenges, such as resource allocation and
optimisation related to their operation, requiring new algorithms to address
these challenges. Various tools have been used in the literature to evaluate
these algorithms. However, these tools suffer from inaccuracy, low fidelity,
unscalability, inflexibility, or additional code requirements. This paper
introduces an emulator based on Mininet and Docker for SFCs called OpenRASE.
The goal of OpenRASE is to enable the exploration of resource allocation
algorithms for SFCs in a dynamic setting, allowing real CPU usage and latency
to be measured. We describe the design and implementation of OpenRASE and
discuss its characteristics. We also experimentally evaluate two different
algorithms to address the SFC resource allocation challenge, including an
online Genetic Algorithm, using OpenRASE to show its effectiveness and
practicality for dynamic network conditions.

Result: 在不同数量传感器节点的模拟中，与单独的PSO和未优化的SCAPSO算法相比，显著减少所需迭代次数，平均定位误差降低84.97%。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合元启发式定位算法在节点定位上效果显著，能有效减少迭代次数和定位误差。

Abstract: The accurate localization of sensor nodes is a fundamental requirement for
the practical application of the Internet of Things (IoT). To enable robust
localization across diverse environments, this paper proposes a hybrid
meta-heuristic localization algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm integrates
the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), which is effective in global search, with
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which excels at local search. An adaptive
switching module is introduced to dynamically select between the two
algorithms. Furthermore, the initialization, fitness evaluation, and parameter
settings of the algorithm have been specifically redesigned and optimized to
address the characteristics of the node localization problem. Simulation
results across varying numbers of sensor nodes demonstrate that, compared to
standalone PSO and the unoptimized SCAPSO algorithm, the proposed method
significantly reduces the number of required iterations and achieves an average
localization error reduction of 84.97%.

Abstract: Modern networked environments increasingly rely on spatial reasoning, but
lack a coherent representation for coordinating physical space. Consequently,
tasks such as enforcing spatial access policies remain fragile and manual. We
first propose a unifying representation based on bigraphs, capturing spatial,
social, and communication relationships within a single formalism, with
user-facing tools to generate bigraphs from physical environments. Second, we
present a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning,
with runtimes for agentic processes to interact the spatial representation, and
a context-aware execution model that scopes reasoning to the smallest viable
subspace. Together, these enable private, reliable, and low-latency spatial
networking that can safely interact with agentic workflows.

Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate
physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to
safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics
failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise
software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical
failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches
for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and
focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing
physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions
addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of
detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.
Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;
(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,
prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable
insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To
support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning}
has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning,
achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual
representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with
potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from
entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in
datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the
model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the
other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the
retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning
disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on
certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible
alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of
granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only
\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also
\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual
concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach
that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations
in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its
capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification
theory. The code is available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

Method: 提出CDA框架，结合ViT捕捉全局解剖信息、CNN提取局部结构特征，分监督训练、自监督目标特征适应、无标签目标数据协作训练三阶段。

Result: 在多站点T1加权MRI数据上的广泛实验表明，CDA始终优于最先进的无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: CDA框架能有效解决LLD检测中样本和领域异质性问题，提高检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain
MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely
intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are
often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant
challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although
incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial
domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner
hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain
transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain
Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA
leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with
each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists
of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)
self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on
unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by
self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between
classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.
The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented
target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak
augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the
CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation
methods.

Conclusion: GVD达到了最先进性能，能生成高分辨率视频和高IPC，且不显著增加计算成本。

Abstract: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with
large video datasets, video dataset distillation aims to capture spatial and
temporal information in a significantly smaller dataset, such that training on
the distilled data has comparable performance to training on all of the data.
We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video
distillation method. GVD jointly distills spatial and temporal features,
ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing
essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative
distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on
the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC).
Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's
performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF.
Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30
percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video
datasets demonstrate that GVD not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without
significantly increasing computational cost.

Result: MINR在域内和分布外场景均优于MAE，同时降低了模型复杂度。

Conclusion: MINR是现有框架的强大高效替代方案，适用于多种自监督学习应用。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown
significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in
image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is
often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can
degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that
synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR
learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and
generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain
scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model
complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning
applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to
existing frameworks.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效进行医学图像分割的不确定性量化，代码开源。

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical
since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert
annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution
using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of
generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated
impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent
stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their
effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed
method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based
generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate
segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling
multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose
pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This
sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,
offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper
insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this

object tracking. Our approach builds upon recent advances in parallel sequence
modeling and introduces a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that
adaptively focuses on relevant spatial regions across temporal sequences. We
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard
benchmarks while maintaining real-time inference speeds. Extensive experiments
on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and MOT17 datasets show improvements of 3.2% in action
recognition accuracy and 2.8% in tracking precision compared to existing
methods, with 40% faster inference time.

TL;DR: 提出基于HOG - CNN混合特征提取模型的临床决策支持框架，在三个公共数据集上验证性能优异，适合资源受限临床环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统眼底图像分析依赖人工，耗时耗资源，需要自动化、可解释的诊断方法。

Method: 提出HOG - CNN混合特征提取模型，融合手工特征HOG和CNN特征。

Result: 在三个数据集上表现出色，如二元DR分类精度98.5%、AUC 99.2等，优于多种先进模型。

Conclusion: HOG - CNN是用于自动视网膜疾病筛查的强大且可扩展工具，适合资源受限临床环境。

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and
diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,
however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and
resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and
interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature
extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration
of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our
model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features
from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark
datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for
Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates
consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for
binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the
IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,
outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,
our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive
performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive
appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.
The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable
for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results
position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease
screening.

Abstract: Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected
around the world, but high-quality labels remain scarce given the effort
required to make physical measurements and observations. This has led to
considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels

temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate
and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global
scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to
consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a
diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We will release a
dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017

TL;DR: 提出分层记忆与异构交互网络HMHI-Net解决无监督视频目标分割中现有记忆机制问题，性能达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UVOS方法依赖记忆高层语义特征，缺乏细粒度信息，导致性能提升有限。

Method: 提出分层记忆架构结合深浅层特征，设计异构交互机制平衡像素和语义特征利用，构建PLAM和SGIM模块实现特征融合。

Result: HMHI-Net在UVOS和视频显著性检测基准上达SOTA，不同骨干网络下性能高。

Conclusion: HMHI-Net具有优越性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level
masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.
While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation
paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains
despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental
flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic
features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained
information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,
memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly
capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise
predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical
memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for
memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic
information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel
and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism
to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their
inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local
Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),
we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level
memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical
Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection
benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across
different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness.

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法多仅关注图像领域，未结合辅助任务增强鲁棒性，而深度伪造现象带来重大威胁。

Method: 提出基于VLM的图像分类方法，利用含60000张图像的新数据集进行零样本模型评估，对比InstructBLIP架构在DFDC - P数据集上零样本和域内微调两种场景与传统方法的性能。

Result: 零样本模型在新数据集上表现优于几乎所有现有方法，VLMs在两种场景下均优于传统分类器。

Conclusion: VLMs在深度伪造检测方面优于传统分类器。

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models
for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media,
identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of
existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized
classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing
only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could
enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of
Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image
classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we
utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which
our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing
methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing
architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against
traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

Motivation: 现有裂缝分割方法缺乏自适应感知和跨模态特征有效交互融合能力，需低成本实现像素级分割。

Method: 提出LIDAR网络，含LacaVSS和LD3CF模块，采用EDG - SS、AFDP等策略，设计LDMK卷积。

Result: 在三个数据集上表现优于SOTA方法，在光场深度数据集上F1为0.8204，mIoU为0.8465，仅5.35M参数。

Conclusion: LIDAR网络能有效感知和融合多模态裂缝线索，生成清晰像素级分割图，性能良好。

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using
multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing
methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive
fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a
Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently
perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different
modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack
segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive
Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain
Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack
cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning
Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain
Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture
spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a
Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive
complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing
most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465
in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at

Method: 将情感理解构建为从细粒度个体情感预测粗粒度群体和事件层面情感的任务，引入基于多模态swin - transformer和S3Attention的GEMS架构，扩展VGAF数据集为VGAF - GEMS。

Result: 与适应性的最先进模型的定量和定性比较证明了GEMS框架在VGAF - GEMS基准测试上的有效性。

Conclusion: GEMS框架将为进一步研究铺平道路，代码和数据可在指定链接获取。

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with
contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social
situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of
predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event
level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer
and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group
members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing
multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions
primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,
we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic
analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims
to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and
arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our
benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses
holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted
state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on
VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further
research. The code and data is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有All - in - One (AiO)模型难以捕捉多样的退化模式，全局滤波方法无法处理高度可变和局部化的失真。

Method: 提出SSGformer，通过传统边缘检测分解出高频边缘特征，用奇异值分解得到低频信息，利用多头线性注意力建模特征关系，生成分组掩码聚类区域，引入组级注意力机制，还提出使用通道和空间注意力的Spatial Grouping Transformer Block。

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法具有优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理复杂多样的恶劣天气退化问题。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns,
driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO
solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global
filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle
highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that
leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather
image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge
features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via
Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to
effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features
are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions
based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,
we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather
removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.
We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel
attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise
relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the
superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the
varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human
actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself
is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than
conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks
designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique
complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and
diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored
specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service
robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and
46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.
Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at
distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,
simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights
due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to
advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we
propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long
distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic
Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human
actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our
code is available at:

Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds
substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures.
However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently

To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame
annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and
11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution
video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed
a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers
of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information
degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed
a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the
transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between
frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our
proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning
small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the
complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific
knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either
fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged
during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared
space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To
address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively
aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt
while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both
previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves
accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a
learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to
activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image
classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental
learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods
across all scenarios.

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法围绕单一分类器，性能受分类器对分布内数据能力的限制。

Method: 创建异质集成COOkeD，结合端到端训练的封闭世界分类器、零样本CLIP分类器和基于CLIP图像特征训练的线性探针分类器。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet等基准测试中，COOkeD实现了最先进的性能，且比经典和基于CLIP的OOD检测方法更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: COOkeD方法简单有效，能在多种具有挑战性的现实场景中实现出色的OOD检测。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in
trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at
test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,
leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised
setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot
setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching
challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by
the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we
show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD
detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD
combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a
specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier
trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is
modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus
introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.
We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also
consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label
noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been
previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art
performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based
OOD detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/glhr/COOkeD

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have
progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the
inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic
content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable
performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these
limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model
trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of
gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning
abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically
adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a
dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively
regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing
reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented
models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,
logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual
expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial
structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material,
texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and
Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional
sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a
global description with paired localized sketch + text information for
conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion
adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches
and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized
features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and
global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's
multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia
to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs
are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves
state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized
metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its
unprecedented level of design customization.

Method: 受高效超分辨率模型启发提出LCS，在低高分辨率的GameIR图像对上训练，利用对抗训练重建重要细节，应用重参数化和量化技术降低模型复杂度和大小。

Result: 在五项不同指标的比较分析中，LCS相比公开可用的AMD硬件缩放功能和FSR1实现了更好的感知质量。

Conclusion: ESR模型在资源受限设备上进行图像缩放有潜力。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a
problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an
AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient
super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a
low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on
GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize
adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important
details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce
model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS
alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling
Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different
metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,
demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained
devices.

Abstract: Leaf wetness detection is a crucial task in agricultural monitoring, as it
directly impacts the prediction and protection of plant diseases. However,
existing sensing systems suffer from limitations in robustness, accuracy, and
environmental resilience when applied to natural leaves under dynamic
real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we introduce a new
multi-modal dataset specifically designed for evaluating and advancing machine
learning algorithms in leaf wetness detection. Our dataset comprises
synchronized mmWave raw data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, and RGB
images collected over six months from five diverse plant species in both
controlled and outdoor field environments. We provide detailed benchmarks using
the Hydra model, including comparisons against single modality baselines and
multiple fusion strategies, as well as performance under varying scan
distances. Additionally, our dataset can serve as a benchmark for future SAR
imaging algorithm optimization, enabling a systematic evaluation of detection
accuracy under diverse conditions.

Motivation: 获取高质量胎儿超声图像依赖超声医师专业知识，在低收入国家因缺乏专业人员面临挑战。

Method: 利用预训练的FetalCLIP模型进行自动胎儿超声图像质量评估，引入基于LoRA的FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$模型，并与六个基线模型对比，还对分割模型进行分类用途改造。

Result: FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$的F1分数达0.757，改造后的分割模型F1分数达0.771。

Conclusion: 对胎儿超声基础模型进行参数高效微调可实现特定任务适应，推动资源有限地区的产前护理。

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play
a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,
posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of
trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a
vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal
ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image
quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce
FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN
and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of
0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed
for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of
0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal
ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing
prenatal care in resource-limited settings. The experimental code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLLMs处理复杂视觉信息时面临高成本、提取细节及跨模态问题，需新方法解决。

Method: 集成CLIP、SigLIP、DINOv2和ConvNeXt四个视觉骨干提取特征，用MoECs模块动态选专家，设计HGA和自适应门控策略。在Phi2 - 2.7B和Vicuna - 7B上训练并评估。

Result: MoCHA在多任务上超越现有模型，如相比CuMo (Mistral - 7B)，MoCHA (Phi2 - 2.7B)在POPE上提升3.25%，MME上提高153分。

Conclusion: 提出的MoECs和HGA模块能有效提升MoCHA整体性能，具有有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling
complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision
encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high
training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual
details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a
novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework
integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to
extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of
Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to
different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the
visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a
Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and
an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two
mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance
across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art
open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo
(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate
hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual
instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in
improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

TL;DR: 提出CapRecover框架直接从中间特征恢复语义内容，评估表现良好，还提出防泄漏方法且无需额外训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision - Language Models在split - DNN配置下存在语义信息泄漏的隐私风险，现有图像重构方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出CapRecover跨模态反演框架直接恢复语义内容，提出添加随机噪声并在下一层去除的保护方法。

Result: CapRecover在多个数据集和模型上语义恢复表现好，如CIFAR - 10上Top - 1标签准确率达92.71%；添加噪声方法可防止语义泄漏且无需额外训练成本。

Conclusion: CapRecover框架能有效恢复语义内容，添加随机噪声方法可缓解语义泄漏问题。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN
configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user
devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing
privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to
reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,
semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose
CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level
semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate
features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating
strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up
to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from
ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis
further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more
semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,
we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to
intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.
Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without
additional training costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有比特流损坏视频恢复方法需耗时费力标注损坏区域，且因局部残差信息易误导特征补全和内容恢复，难以实现高质量恢复。

Method: 提出集成视觉基础模型与恢复模型的框架，其中DAC模型增强损坏定位和盲恢复，引入CFC模块自适应处理残差贡献，采用VFM引导的分层特征增强和MoRE结构抑制伪影、增强信息残差。

Result: 所提方法在比特流损坏视频恢复中取得出色性能，无需手动标注掩码序列。

Conclusion: 该方法的有效性有助于实现更好的用户体验、更广泛的应用场景和更可靠的多媒体通信与存储系统。

Abstract: Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems,
as even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain
degradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,
bitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and
understudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and
labor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,
resulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery
remains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames
may mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,
we propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that
integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to
different types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the
framework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich
priors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and
corruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.
Additionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)
module, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level
corruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and
high-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our
method suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive
evaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in
bitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask
sequence. The demonstrated effectiveness will help to realize improved user
experience, wider application scenarios, and more reliable multimedia
communication and storage systems.

Motivation: 现有细胞分割方法存在局限，难以从大规模3D显微镜图像中分割细胞结构，限制临床见解，尤其针对小胶质细胞。

Method: 采用两阶段方法，先用带视觉变换器的3D U - Net检测胞体，再用带交叉注意力块的相同架构细化胞体和分支；分两阶段训练，先自监督胞体分割，再基于提示的分支分割。

Result: 在41,230个小胶质细胞数据集上训练和评估，trAIce3D显著提高了分割精度和泛化性。

Conclusion: trAIce3D架构虽针对小胶质细胞优化，但可扩展到其他复杂细胞类型，拓宽其在神经生物学研究中的影响。

Abstract: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within
the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D
microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for
microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases.
Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with
overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter
tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We
introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia
segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage
approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects
somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the
same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections,
refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a
3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases:
self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch
Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and
evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly
improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis
of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its
architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and
astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

TL;DR: 提出结合CNN与集合数值天气预报模型进行超短期地表温度预测的方法，可减少误差、提升精度，适合计算资源有限的业务中心。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因计算资源有限，业务中长期温度预报依赖低分辨率模型，易产生系统和随机误差，需改进方法。

Method: 先通过基于CNN的后处理减少系统误差，再对经CNN校正的成员进行集合平均减少随机误差，还研究校正和集合平均顺序对精度的影响。

Result: 先CNN校正再集合平均的方法精度更高，该方法显著优于高分辨率确定性NWP模型。

Conclusion: 结合CNN校正与集合平均可有效减少NWP模型输出的系统和随机误差，是改进中长期温度预报的实用可扩展方案。

Abstract: This study proposes a method that integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, enabling
surface temperature forecasting at lead times beyond the short-range (five-day)
forecast period. Owing to limited computational resources, operational
medium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models,
which are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations,
the proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based
post-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble
member, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution
model outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of
the CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of
CNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For
comparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with
the CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN
correction before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy
than the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts,
the proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP
models. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with
ensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in
NWP model outputs. The proposed approach is a practical and scalable solution
for improving medium-range temperature forecasts, and is particularly valuable
at operational centers with limited computational resources.

Conclusion: 可得到适用于现实环境中复杂实时sEMG任务的高效且有表现力的模型。

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals offer a promising avenue for
developing innovative human-computer interfaces by providing insights into
muscular activity. However, the limited volume of training data and
computational constraints during deployment have restricted the investigation
of scaling up the model size for solving sEMG tasks. In this paper, we
demonstrate that vanilla transformer models can be effectively scaled up on
sEMG data and yield improved cross-user performance up to 110M parameters,
surpassing the model size regime investigated in other sEMG research (usually
<10M parameters). We show that >100M-parameter models can be effectively
distilled into models 50x smaller with minimal loss of performance (<1.5%
absolute). This results in efficient and expressive models suitable for complex
real-time sEMG tasks in real-world environments.

Result: 实验表明该方法比基线有显著改进，尤其在高背景噪声干扰环境。

Conclusion: 该改进的VAD能有效提升嘈杂环境中VAD准确性，还能改善干净语音检测。

Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) in the presence of background noise remains a
challenging problem in speech processing. Accurate VAD is essential in
automatic speech recognition, voice-to-text, conversational agents, etc, where
noise can severely degrade the performance. A modern application includes the
voice assistant, specially mounted on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
devices such as cell phones, smart glasses, earbuds, etc, where the voice
signal includes background noise. Therefore, VAD modules must remain
light-weight due to their practical on-device limitation. The existing models
often struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios across diverse acoustic
environments. A simple VAD often detects human voice in a clean environment,
but struggles to detect the human voice in noisy conditions. We propose a
noise-robust VAD that comprises a light-weight VAD, with data pre-processing
and post-processing added modules to handle the background noise. This approach
significantly enhances the VAD accuracy in noisy environments and requires
neither a larger model, nor fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach achieves a notable improvement compared to baselines, particularly
in environments with high background noise interference. This modified VAD
additionally improving clean speech detection.

Abstract: State-space models are pivotal for dynamic system analysis but often struggle
with outlier data that deviates from Gaussian distributions, frequently
exhibiting skewness and heavy tails. This paper introduces a robust extension
utilizing the asymmetric Laplace distribution, specifically tailored to capture
these complex characteristics. We propose an efficient variational Bayes
algorithm and a novel single-loop parameter estimation strategy, significantly
enhancing the efficiency of the filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation
processes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our methods provide
consistently robust performance across various noise settings without the need
for manual hyperparameter adjustments. In stark contrast, existing models
generally rely on specific noise conditions and necessitate extensive manual
tuning. Moreover, our approach uses far fewer computational resources, thereby
validating the model's effectiveness and underscoring its potential for
practical applications in fields such as robust control and financial modeling.

Conclusion: 该算法有效，在超出训练和验证域的测试中也表现良好。

Abstract: A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic
structures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead
of learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the
optimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach
devises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the
method predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a
surrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation
method. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping
between the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space
determined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the
parametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional
representation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an
educated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the
intermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing
equations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential
errors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the
design in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics.
Different architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation
capabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The
quasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by
reducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\%$ while
achieving discrepancies below $4\%$ in the optimal value of the objective
functional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to
extrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for
developing control strategies in chemical process systems using historical
data, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work
investigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of
an exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a
Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's
nonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and
operational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant
scenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes
reproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers
with randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL
algorithms in realistic process control tasks.
  We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms,
highlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets
and degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a
novel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action
correction using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models.
The PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by
descending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring
retraining or environment interaction.
  Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with
convex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and
maintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the
feasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware
corrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork
for more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.

Abstract: As neural networks (NNs) become increasingly prevalent in safety-critical
neural network-controlled cyber-physical systems (NNCSs), formally guaranteeing
their safety becomes crucial. For these systems, safety must be ensured
throughout their entire operation, necessitating infinite-time horizon
verification. To verify the infinite-time horizon safety of NNCSs, recent
approaches leverage Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). However, these dL-based
guarantees rely on idealized, real-valued NN semantics and fail to account for
roundoff errors introduced by finite-precision implementations. This paper
bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world implementations
by incorporating robustness under finite-precision perturbations -- in sensing,
actuation, and computation -- into the safety verification. We model the
problem as a hybrid game between a good Demon, responsible for control actions,
and a bad Angel, introducing perturbations. This formulation enables formal
proofs of robustness w.r.t. a given (bounded) perturbation. Leveraging this
bound, we employ state-of-the-art mixed-precision fixed-point tuners to
synthesize sound and efficient implementations, thus providing a complete
end-to-end solution. We evaluate our approach on case studies from the
automotive and aeronautics domains, producing efficient NN implementations with
rigorous infinite-time horizon safety guarantees.

TL;DR: 本文通过更精简归约到XOR反驳及处理奇元情况，改进特定情况下的静态数据结构下界，并给出相关技术结论及应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进Korten等人工作中某些情况下的静态数据结构下界。

Method: 采用更精简的归约到XOR反驳方法，处理奇元情况。

Result: 实现了当前最优半随机k - XOR反驳分析的完全去随机化，证明多输出常深度拉伸电路输出远离具有足够独立性分布采样的字符串且可有效认证。

Conclusion: 结果可用于单元探测下界和NC⁰电路范围避免算法。

Abstract: A recent work (Korten, Pitassi, and Impagliazzo, FOCS 2025) established an
insightful connection between static data structure lower bounds, range
avoidance of $\text{NC}^0$ circuits, and the refutation of pseudorandom CSP
instances, leading to improvements to some longstanding lower bounds in the
cell-probe/bit-probe models. Here, we improve these lower bounds in certain
cases via a more streamlined reduction to XOR refutation, coupled with handling
the odd-arity case. Our result can be viewed as a complete derandomization of
the state-of-the-art semi-random $k$-XOR refutation analysis (Guruswami,
Kothari and Manohar, STOC 2022, Hsieh, Kothari and Mohanty, SODA 2023), which
complements the derandomization of the even-arity case obtained by Korten et
al.
  As our main technical statement, we show that for any multi-output
constant-depth circuit that substantially stretches its input, its output is
very likely far from strings sampled from distributions with sufficient
independence, and further this can be efficiently certified. Via suitable
shifts in perspectives, this gives applications to cell-probe lower bounds and
range avoidance algorithms for $\mathsf{NC}^0$ circuits.

### [210] [Valuing Time in Silicon: Can Large Language Model Replicate Human Value of Travel Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22244)
*Yingnan Yan,Tianming Liu,Yafeng Yin*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究分析GPT - 4o的旅行时间价值，发现其与人类行为有高度相似性，但情境敏感性不如人类，为LLM作为人类旅行者代理的未来发展提供基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未证实大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂场景中的行为保真度，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用全因子实验设计，系统考察LLM对各种交通情境的敏感性。

Result: LLM与人类行为有高度相似性，总体旅行时间价值与人类相近，对旅行目的、收入和时间 - 成本权衡比率有类似人类的敏感性，行为模式在不同情境下一致，但情境敏感性不如人类。

Conclusion: 本研究为LLM作为人类旅行者代理的未来发展提供了基础基准，表明其有价值和稳健性，但需谨慎考虑其情境敏感性不足的问题。

Abstract: As a key advancement in artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs)
are set to transform transportation systems. While LLMs offer the potential to
simulate human travelers in future mixed-autonomy transportation systems, their
behavioral fidelity in complex scenarios remains largely unconfirmed by
existing research. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive
analysis of the value of travel time (VOT) of a popular LLM, GPT-4o. We employ
a full factorial experimental design to systematically examine the LLM's
sensitivity to various transportation contexts, including the choice setting,
travel purpose, income, and socio-demographic factors. Our results reveal a
high degree of behavioral similarity between the LLM and humans. The LLM
exhibits an aggregate VOT similar to that of humans, and demonstrates
human-like sensitivity to travel purpose, income, and the time-cost trade-off
ratios of the alternatives. Furthermore, the behavioral patterns of LLM are
remarkably consistent across varied contexts. However, we also find that the
LLM's context sensitivity is less pronounced than that observed in humans.
Overall, this study provides a foundational benchmark for the future
development of LLMs as proxies for human travelers, demonstrating their value
and robustness while highlighting that their blunted contextual sensitivity
requires careful consideration.

Motivation: 探究加密货币市场风险传导动态并进行波动性预测。

Method: 提出新框架揭示两个关键实证事实，提取时变分位数溢出特征并嵌入扩展Log - HAR结构得到SA - Log - HAR模型。

Result: 提出的SA - Log - HAR模型在样本内拟合和样本外预测中均优于基准模型，在捕捉极端波动和尾部风险方面更具稳健性和解释力。

Conclusion: SA - Log - HAR模型是一种有效的加密货币市场波动性预测模型。

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of risk transmission in cryptocurrency
markets and proposes a novel framework for volatility forecasting. The
framework uncovers two key empirical facts: the asymmetric amplification of
volatility spillovers in both tails, and a structural decoupling between market
size and systemic importance. Building on these insights, we develop a
state-adaptive volatility forecasting model by extracting time-varying quantile
spillover features across different volatility components. These features are
embedded into an extended Log-HAR structure, resulting in the SA-Log-HAR model.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms benchmark
alternatives in both in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting,
particularly in capturing extreme volatility and tail risks with greater
robustness and explanatory power.

TL;DR: 本文引入GAISI衡量英国工作对大语言模型的暴露度，该指数可靠且预测力强，显示多数工作有暴露但仅少数受重影响，还呈现暴露度、任务价格溢价和岗位招聘变化，表明替代效应或超生产率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种衡量英国工作对大语言模型暴露度的方法，评估生成式AI对工作的影响。

Method: 通过大语言模型的概率任务评级和技能与就业调查的工人报告任务数据推导GAISI。

Result: GAISI可靠性高、与AI能力契合且预测力强；多数工作有暴露但少数受重影响；自2017年总体暴露度上升；任务价格溢价下降；高暴露岗位招聘减少。

Conclusion: GAISI为评估生成式AI对工作的影响提供了可靠框架，有早期证据表明替代效应可能已超过生产率提升。

Abstract: We introduce the Generative AI Susceptibility Index (GAISI), a task-based
measure of UK job exposure to large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT.
GAISI is derived from probabilistic task ratings by LLMs and linked to
worker-reported task data from the Skills and Employment Surveys. It reflects
the share of job activities where an LLM or LLM-powered system can reduce task
completion time by at least 25 per cent beyond existing productivity tools. The
index demonstrates high reliability, strong alignment with AI capabilities, and
superior predictive power compared to existing exposure measures. By 2023-24,
nearly all UK jobs exhibited some exposure, yet only a minority were heavily
affected. Aggregate exposure has risen since 2017, primarily due to
occupational shifts rather than changes in task profiles. The price premium for
AI-exposed tasks declined relative to 2017, measuring approximately 11 per cent
lower in 2023-24. Job postings in high-exposure roles also fell by 6.5 per cent
following the release of ChatGPT. GAISI offers a robust framework for assessing
generative AI's impact on work, providing early evidence that displacement
effects may already outweigh productivity gains.

Motivation: 经典次线性期望理论对原始不确定性模型的非凸几何不敏感，需要为一类非凸模型开发新的随机微积分。

Method: 引入全耦合平均场正倒向随机微分方程，通过对驱动关于控制变量的一致强凹性假设确保优化有唯一稳定解，从原始几何和正则性条件建立优化器的Lipschitz稳定性。

Result: 证明了FBSDE系统的局部和全局适定性定理，得到的Θ - 期望是动态一致的，违反次可加性公理且不具有平移不变性。

Conclusion: 为一类非凸、内生模糊性下的随机微积分提供了严格基础。

Abstract: The canonical theory of sublinear expectations, a foundation of stochastic
calculus under ambiguity, is insensitive to the non-convex geometry of
primitive uncertainty models. This paper develops a new stochastic calculus for
a structured class of such non-convex models. We introduce a class of fully
coupled Mean-Field Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations where the
BSDE driver is defined by a pointwise maximization over a law-dependent,
non-convex set. Mathematical tractability is achieved via a uniform strong
concavity assumption on the driver with respect to the control variable, which
ensures the optimization admits a unique and stable solution. A central
contribution is to establish the Lipschitz stability of this optimizer from
primitive geometric and regularity conditions, which underpins the entire
well-posedness theory. We prove local and global well-posedness theorems for
the FBSDE system. The resulting valuation functional, the $\Theta$-Expectation,
is shown to be dynamically consistent and, most critically, to violate the
axiom of sub-additivity. This, along with its failure to be translation
invariant, demonstrates its fundamental departure from the convex paradigm.
This work provides a rigorous foundation for stochastic calculus under a class
of non-convex, endogenous ambiguity.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于一致性模型的物理约束生成建模框架，可快速对格陵兰冰盖表面质量平衡和温度场进行降尺度，性能优于插值法，还能直接对地球系统模型场降尺度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对格陵兰冰盖表面质量平衡和温度的预测方法要么计算需求大，要么空间尺度粗糙，需要更有效的方法来进行高分辨率预测以理解未来海平面上升。

Method: 引入基于一致性模型的物理约束生成建模框架，在区域气候模型MARv3.12的月输出上训练，以冰盖地形和日照为条件，推理时施加硬守恒约束。

Result: 在测试集上，约束一致性模型对表面质量平衡的连续排名概率得分为6.31 mmWE，表面温度为0.1 K，优于基于插值的降尺度方法，能如实再现不同空间尺度的变异性，还能直接对地球系统模型场降尺度。

Conclusion: 该方法能为冰盖模拟提供逼真的高分辨率气候强迫，推理速度快，可集成到地球系统和冰盖模型工作流程中，改善对格陵兰及其他冰盖和冰川未来海平面上升贡献的预测。

Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution projections of the Greenland ice sheet's surface
mass balance (SMB) and surface temperature are essential for understanding
future sea-level rise, yet current approaches are either computationally
demanding or limited to coarse spatial scales. Here, we introduce a novel
physics-constrained generative modeling framework based on a consistency model
(CM) to downscale low-resolution SMB and surface temperature fields by a factor
of up to 32 (from 160 km to 5 km grid spacing) in a few sampling steps. The CM
is trained on monthly outputs of the regional climate model MARv3.12 and
conditioned on ice-sheet topography and insolation. By enforcing a hard
conservation constraint during inference, we ensure approximate preservation of
SMB and temperature sums on the coarse spatial scale as well as robust
generalization to extreme climate states without retraining. On the test set,
our constrained CM achieves a continued ranked probability score of 6.31 mmWE
for the SMB and 0.1 K for the surface temperature, outperforming
interpolation-based downscaling. Together with spatial power-spectral analysis,
we demonstrate that the CM faithfully reproduces variability across spatial
scales. We further apply bias-corrected outputs of the NorESM2 Earth System
Model as inputs to our CM, to demonstrate the potential of our model to
directly downscale ESM fields. Our approach delivers realistic, high-resolution
climate forcing for ice-sheet simulations with fast inference and can be
readily integrated into Earth-system and ice-sheet model workflows to improve
projections of the future contribution to sea-level rise from Greenland and
potentially other ice sheets and glaciers too.

Conclusion: aLLoyM有加速材料体系发现的潜力，公开版本和数据集利于进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are general-purpose tools with wide-ranging
applications, including in materials science. In this work, we introduce
aLLoyM, a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained on alloy compositions,
temperatures, and their corresponding phase information. To develop aLLoyM, we
curated question-and-answer (Q&A) pairs for binary and ternary phase diagrams
using the open-source Computational Phase Diagram Database (CPDDB) and
assessments based on CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams). We fine-tuned
Mistral, an open-source pre-trained LLM, for two distinct Q&A formats:
multiple-choice and short-answer. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that
fine-tuning substantially enhances performance on multiple-choice phase diagram
questions. Moreover, the short-answer model of aLLoyM exhibits the ability to
generate novel phase diagrams from its components alone, underscoring its
potential to accelerate the discovery of previously unexplored materials
systems. To promote further research and adoption, we have publicly released
the short-answer fine-tuned version of aLLoyM, along with the complete
benchmarking Q&A dataset, on Hugging Face.

Motivation: 近期分析对TroVE在MATH基准上通过诱导和复用高级工具箱取得的优势提出质疑，需重新评估其有效性。

Method: 重新评估TroVE在MATH上的表现，分析各模式影响，修正TroVE选择机制的实现。

Result: 修正TroVE实现后性能提升3%，匹配计算量后优势降至1%。

Conclusion: 工具盒方法在MATH基准上未提供显著优势。

Abstract: Reusing established theorems and formulas is central to mathematical problem
solving, serving as essential building blocks for tackling increasingly complex
challenges. Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language
Models (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and
reusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an
ensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and
reusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only
performs direct generation. However, recent analysis (Berlot-Attwell et al.,
2024) casts doubt on these gains, noting that the tools created are often
trivial or rarely reused, suggesting that improvements may stem from
self-consistency or self-correction. In this work, we re-evaluate TroVE on
MATH, analyze the impact of each of its modes, and show that its benefit does
not come from these mechanisms, but simply from a higher computational budget
spent for TroVE compared to PRIMITIVE. To this end, we also perform a small
correction in the original implementation of TroVE's selection mechanism,
boosting TroVE's performance on MATH by 3\% in accuracy. After matching for
compute, the benefit of TroVE reduces to a marginal improvement of 1\%,
suggesting that this toolbox approach does not provide a significant benefit on
MATH.

Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and
agent-based systems, with a primary focus on trading and financial modeling.
However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally
dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we
introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit
evaluation by mirroring real-world decision-making processes. The framework
employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents
collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive
learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further
present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent
systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions.
Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment,
addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA
outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical
LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit
scoring.

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the
information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised
embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To
understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural
information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of
negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions;
(2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the
performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for
a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based
classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of
retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data
distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads
to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a
classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing
datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the
generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种可扩展的方法来增强现有基准，提高其评估大语言模型在语言变化方面性能的外部有效性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not
exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to
standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety
of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs,
which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance
when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost
method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with
identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting
significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation.
Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either
low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of
model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment
existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they
provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.

Method: 用大语言模型生成含476个英语动词的句子语料，让模型像专家语言学家一样分析语料中句子的句法结构。

Result: 该管道在多个评估数据集上优于两个广泛使用的句法解析器，所需资源远少于手动解析，产出新的VFF数据库。

Conclusion: 此工作是自动框架频率估算的概念验证，代码和数据开源以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies
(VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames.
VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language
systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale,
accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a
corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM
to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of
the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used
syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires
far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling
rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF
database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and
explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates
commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and
extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present
this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and
release all code and data to support future research.

Motivation: 现有机器翻译偏好学习方法依赖精心策划的三元组数据集且泛化能力差。

Method: 提出RLfR框架，利用外部教师模型（GPT - 4o）的连续高质量反馈，将每个翻译步骤视为微教程，以负编辑距离和COMET分数为信号指导学习。

Result: 在FLORES - 200基准测试中，RLfR始终优于MT - SFT和基于偏好的基线，显著提高COMET和M - ETA分数。

Conclusion: RLfR框架有效，能摆脱对静态三元组的依赖并提升翻译效果。

Abstract: Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend
heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to
generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from
Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on
static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an
external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a
micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and
the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's
refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance,
promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring
semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher,
mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement.
On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese,
Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and
preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy)
and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.

Result: 结构表征的可分离性受梯度偏好强度的系统调节，每个结构的典型示例在LLMs激活空间中占据更独特的区域。

Conclusion: 结果有力证明LLMs学习到丰富、有意义且分级的结构表征，支持了用几何方法衡量LLMs中基本构式语法原则。

Abstract: The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach posits that language comprises
a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely
determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and
probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in
Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience.
We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions
(Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of
$5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference
strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between
construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon
Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More
prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the
activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn
rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer
support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.

framework using the FairytaleQA dataset as the source material. Eventually, the
proposed approach has the potential to become an important part of autonomous
AI-driven English instructors.

TL;DR: 现有NIAH基准可能高估LLM长文本理解能力，提出新基准NeedleChain及ROPE Contraction策略评估和提升LLM能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NIAH基准可能高估LLM真实长文本理解能力，需更好评估方法。

Method: 引入新基准NeedleChain，提出ROPE Contraction策略。

Result: 实验表明先进LLM处理大文本能力和完全理解能力有显著差距。

Conclusion: 新基准和策略能更全面分析和提升LLM长文本理解能力。

Abstract: The Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is widely used to evaluate Large
Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts (LC). It evaluates
the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive
query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted
standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may
overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given
contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we
introduce a novel benchmark, \textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists
entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the
input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and
reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance.
Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve
LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with
various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to
process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them. Source code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hyeonseokk/NeedleChain

TL;DR: 研究用gpt - 4o - mini为236个国家生成故事，发现故事结构单一，存在叙事同质化，构成AI叙事标准化偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究主要基于英美文本训练的语言模型能否生成与其他国家文化相关的故事。

Method: 向OpenAI的gpt - 4o - mini模型发送提示，为236个国家各生成50个1500字故事。

Result: 故事虽有表层国家符号和主题，但叙事结构单一，存在叙事同质化，优先考虑稳定和传统。

Conclusion: AI生成叙事的结构同质性构成一种独特的AI偏差，即叙事标准化偏差，应与常见的表征偏差一同被承认，研究成果对多领域有意义。

Abstract: Can a language model trained largely on Anglo-American texts generate stories
that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated
11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt "Write a
1500 word potential {demonym} story" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although
the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they
overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a
protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor
conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events.
Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative
tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is
a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that
prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that
the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct
form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged
alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant
to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and
efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.

Motivation: 传统面向任务的对话系统需要大量标注数据，要解决此问题。

Method: 提出结合BERT和大语言模型的混合方法，利用大语言模型泛化能力和BERT计算效率。

Result: 在多方对话语料上评估，BERT输出信息共享至大语言模型可提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 结合BERT和大语言模型的混合方法在意图识别和OOS检测中有效果，信息共享能改善系统性能。

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue
systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is
Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However,
traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we
propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot
settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages
LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such
scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and
observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system
performance improvement.

Motivation: 为‘大语言模型不是抽象推理者’这一观点增添细微差别，重新审视相关实验。

Method: 重新进行实验，研究大语言模型在零样本设置和微调少量输入编码参数后的表现。

Result: 大语言模型在零样本设置中表现差，微调少量输入编码参数可实现近乎完美性能，但微调效果不一定跨数据集迁移。

Conclusion: 引发关于‘抽象推理者’定义以及大语言模型是否符合该定义的讨论。

Abstract: Recent work has argued that large language models (LLMs) are not "abstract
reasoners", citing their poor zero-shot performance on a variety of challenging
tasks as evidence. We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the
claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot
setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable
near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not
necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical
results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an
"abstract reasoner", and why it matters whether LLMs fit the bill.

Conclusion: 大语言模型在专利摘要生成中具有良好表现，代码和数据集开源利于后续研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in
several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent
writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In
this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework
for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a
patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a
consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER
goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output
quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g.,
BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations,
and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks.
We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone.
Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and
stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific
baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and
future research.

Motivation: 大语言模型用于临床决策支持面临处理记录、临床幻觉、评估指标不可靠等挑战，需解决这些问题。

Method: 提出CliCARE框架，将非结构化纵向EHR转换为患者特定的时间知识图谱，使决策支持过程与规范指南知识图谱对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CliCARE显著优于强基线，评估协议显示结果与肿瘤专家评估高度相关。

Conclusion: CliCARE框架在处理纵向癌症电子健康记录决策支持方面有效，能为肿瘤学家提供有证据支持的决策。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical
decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex,
longitudinal cancer Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, their
implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the
inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature
of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of
clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate
process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that
hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we
propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical
Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health
Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs
into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range
dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these
real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph.
This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by
generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation.
We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private
Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these
diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including
leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The
clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol,
which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert
oncologists.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLM）安全机制易受利用认知偏差的对抗攻击，以往越狱方法多关注提示工程或算法操作，而多偏差交互的影响被忽视。

Method: 提出CognitiveAttack框架，结合监督微调与强化学习，生成嵌入优化偏差组合的提示。

Result: 实验表明30种不同LLM存在显著漏洞，尤其是开源模型，CognitiveAttack攻击成功率（60.1%）远高于SOTA黑盒方法PAP（31.6%）。

Conclusion: 多偏差交互是强大且未充分探索的攻击向量，该研究结合认知科学与LLM安全，为构建更强大、符合人类需求的AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from
rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt
engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked
power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose
CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages
both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that
embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while
maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant
vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.
CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to
the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations
in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions
as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel
interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety,
paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未充分探索语言特定神经元在放大方面的作用，本文旨在研究其影响。

Method: 对18种语言（含低资源语言），用三种不同主要训练语言的模型进行干预，用LSS评估得分比较放大因子，在下游任务评估。

Result: 最优放大因子能使输出转向几乎所有测试语言，干预在部分下游任务提升母语表现，但一般会降低跨语言结果。

Conclusion: 语言特定神经元在多语言行为中有影响，放大对低资源语言有益，跨语言迁移优势有限。

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual
languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them.
However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work
investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through
interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three
models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification
factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a
proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on
downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge
(Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors
effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using
this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some
cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight
the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where
amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but
provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

Result: 推出了BALSAM基准。

Conclusion: BALSAM可作为统一平台设定标准，促进协作研究，提升阿拉伯语大语言模型能力。

Abstract: The impressive advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in English has not
been matched across all languages. In particular, LLM performance in Arabic
lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its
dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the
quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly
available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated
platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual
progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps.
In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark
aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP
tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K
development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We
envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes
collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖人工注释，可扩展性强，发布的管道便于相关研究。

Abstract: Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical
challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this
work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly
optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify
the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated
summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline
summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity
extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the
model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward
entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality
annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a
significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in
fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline,
facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using
lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL性能对示例选择和顺序敏感，且未探索过新的位置偏差，因此研究DPP偏差。

Method: 设计系统评估流程，引入ACCURACY - CHANGE和PREDICTION - CHANGE两个指标量化偏差影响。

Result: 对10个LLM实验发现，偏差显著影响准确率和预测结果，示例放开头输出最稳定准确，放用户消息结尾在QA任务会翻转超30%预测且不提升正确率，小模型受影响更大。

Conclusion: DPP偏差显著影响LLM的ICL性能，示例位置对输出稳定性和准确性有重要影响。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.
