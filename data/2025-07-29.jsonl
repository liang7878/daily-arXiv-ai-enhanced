The principal must design\na contract to incentivize the agent. Is there still an approximation scheme? In\nthis work, our ultimate goal is an algorithm-to-contract transformation, which\ntransforms algorithms for combinatorial problems (like budgeted maximization)\nto tackle incentive constraints that arise in contract design. Our approach\ndiverges from previous works on combinatorial contract design by avoiding an\nassumption of black-box access to a demand oracle.\n  We first show how to \"lift\" the FPTAS for budgeted maximization to obtain the\nbest-possible multiplicative and additive FPTAS for the contract design\nproblem. We establish this through our \"local-global\" framework, in which the\n\"local\" step is to (approximately) solve a two-sided strengthened variant of\nthe demand problem.

Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components.

To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),\ncan be used to leverage information across related domains. An important\nconsideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based\nmetrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.\nThus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is\nto identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for\nwhich the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.\nGenerally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain\nexpertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on\nthe dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial.

While previous research has\ndocumented substantial wage premiums for AI-related roles due to growing demand\nand limited talent supply, our study asks whether this demand also translates\ninto enhanced non-monetary compensation. We find that AI roles are\nsignificantly more likely to offer such perks, even after controlling for\neducation requirements, industry, and occupation type. It is twice as likely\nfor an AI role to offer parental leave and almost three times more likely to\nprovide remote working options. Moreover, the highest-paying AI roles tend to\nbundle these benefits, suggesting a compound premium where salary increases\ncoincide with expanded non-monetary rewards. AI roles offering parental leave\nor health benefits show salaries that are, on average, 12% to 20% higher than\nAI roles without this benefit.

By leveraging the semantic\nframework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies\n(CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be\norganized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then\nused to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based\non the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term\n`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.\nAdditionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,\nwhich conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic\nconcept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an\nalternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process\nprofiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,\nwe demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be\nseamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis\nand decision-making.

A forward problem predicts the\noutput of a network for a given input by optimizing weights and biases. An\ninverse problem finds equation parameters or coefficients that effectively\nmodel the data. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both\nproblems. PINNs inject prior analytical information about the data into the\ncost function to improve model performance outside the training set boundaries.\nThis also allows PINNs to efficiently solve problems with sparse data without\noverfitting by extrapolating the model to fit larger trends in the data. The\nprior information we implement is in the form of differential equations.\nResiduals are the differences between the left-hand and right-hand sides of\ncorresponding differential equations; PINNs minimize these residuals to\neffectively solve the differential equation and take advantage of prior\nknowledge. In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss\nfunction and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the\nmodel parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and\ninverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with\nresiduals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and\nthen expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex\ndifferential equations.

A graph with\nmillions of edges can have trillions of temporal motifs, since the same edge\ncan occur with multiple timestamps. There is a combinatorial explosion of\npossibilities, and state-of-the-art algorithms cannot manage motifs with more\nthan four vertices.\n  In this work, we present TIMEST: a general, fast, and accurate estimation\nalgorithm to count temporal motifs of arbitrary sizes in temporal networks. Our\napproach introduces a temporal spanning tree sampler that leverages weighted\nsampling to generate substructures of target temporal motifs. This method\ncarefully takes a subset of temporal constraints of the motif that can be\njointly and efficiently sampled. TIMEST uses randomized estimation techniques\nto obtain accurate estimates of motif counts.\n  We give theoretical guarantees on the running time and approximation\nguarantees of TIMEST. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and show\nthat TIMEST is both faster and more accurate than previous algorithms. Our CPU\nimplementation exhibits an average speedup of 28x over state-of-the-art GPU\nimplementation of the exact algorithm, and 6x speedup over SOTA approximate\nalgorithms while consistently showcasing less than 5% error in most cases. For\nexample, TIMEST can count the number of instances of a financial fraud temporal\nmotif in four minutes with 0.6% error, while exact methods take more than two\ndays."}

A promising direction for obtaining\nconditional dependence for conformal sets--in particular capturing\nheteroskedasticity--is through estimating the conditional density\n$\\mathbb{P}_{Y|X}$ and conformalizing its level sets. Previous work in this\nvein has focused on nonconformity scores based on the empirical cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF). Such scores are, however, computationally costly,\ntypically requiring expensive sampling methods. To avoid the need for sampling,\nwe observe that the CDF-based score reduces to a Mahalanobis distance in the\ncase of Gaussian scores, yielding a closed-form expression that can be directly\nconformalized. Moreover, the use of a Gaussian-based score opens the door to a\nnumber of extensions of the basic conformal method; in particular, we show how\nto construct conformal sets with missing output values, refine conformal sets\nas partial information about $Y$ becomes available, and construct conformal\nsets on transformations of the output space. Finally, empirical results\nindicate that our approach produces conformal sets that more closely\napproximate conditional coverage in multivariate settings compared to\nalternative methods."}

However, relying solely on gradient information, these\nmethods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,\nplateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature\ninformation from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are\ncomputationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order\ntechnique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry\nof a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only\ngradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for\nlocating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel\nframework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the\nDimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating\nthe Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By\nperiodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the\nminimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points\nand flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.\nPreliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves\ncompetitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving\nnavigation of complex loss landscapes.

Recent advances have\nshown that leveraging auxiliary datasets, such as those synthesized by\ngenerative models, can improve the accuracy of these value estimates.\nUnfortunately, such auxiliary datasets may also be biased, and existing methods\nfor using data augmentation for OPE in RL lack principled uncertainty\nquantification. In high stakes settings like healthcare, reliable uncertainty\nestimates are important for comparing policy value estimates. In this work, we\npropose two approaches to construct valid confidence intervals for OPE when\nusing data augmentation. The first provides a confidence interval over the\npolicy performance conditioned on a particular initial state $V^{\\pi}(s_0)$--\nsuch intervals are particularly important for human-centered applications. To\ndo so we introduce a new conformal prediction method for high dimensional state\nMDPs. Second, we consider the more common task of estimating the average policy\nperformance over many initial states; to do so we draw on ideas from doubly\nrobust estimation and prediction powered inference. Across simulators spanning\nrobotics, healthcare and inventory management, and a real healthcare dataset\nfrom MIMIC-IV, we find that our methods can use augmented data and still\nconsistently produce intervals that cover the ground truth values, unlike\npreviously proposed methods."}

However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model.

To mitigate\nthese challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator\n(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate\ncontext-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and\nadaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.\nOur experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG\noutperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in\nterms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the\ncalculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL\nnetwork."}

Accurate property prediction\nfor polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.\nHowever, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by\nthe constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,\nsince the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,\nwe propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training\nframework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and\nintegrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.\nFrom the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)\nand graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we\ndemonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to\napplying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose\nto further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).\nMoreover, we show the robustness of the \"star linking\" strategy through Repeat\nand Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, \"star linking\"\nstrategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,\na common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)\ntest. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the\ncapability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences.

We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage.

By bridging the translational gap, programmable\nvirtual humans offer a transformative path to optimize therapeutic efficacy and\nsafety earlier than ever before. This perspective introduces the concept of\nprogrammable virtual humans, explores their roles in a new paradigm of drug\ndiscovery centered on human physiology, and outlines key opportunities,\nchallenges, and roadmaps for their realization."}

While recent advances leverage\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align\nmodels with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear\nacross diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically\ninvestigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code\npreferences. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, we\nhypothesize that SFT excels in scenarios with objectively verifiable optimal\nsolutions, while applying SFT followed by DPO (S&D) enables models to explore\nsuperior solutions in scenarios without objectively verifiable optimal\nsolutions. Based on the analysis and experimental evidence, we propose Adaptive\nPreference Optimization (APO), a dynamic integration approach that adaptively\namplifies preferred responses, suppresses dispreferred ones, and encourages\nexploration of potentially superior solutions during training. Extensive\nexperiments across six representative code preference tasks validate our\ntheoretical hypotheses and demonstrate that APO consistently matches or\nsurpasses the performance of existing SFT and S&D strategies.

We formulate the node ranking task as a regression\nproblem and use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to generate\nground truth influence scores. 1D-CGS is initially trained on synthetic\nnetworks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and then applied to real world\nnetworks for identifying influential nodes.

Modern high performance\ncomputing (HPC) systems provide high parallelism and heterogeneity across\nnodes, devices, and cores. To achieve good performance, effective scheduling\nand load balancing techniques are essential. Parallel programming frameworks\nsuch as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support\ndiverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling\nalgorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable\nalgorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics.\n  In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling\nalgorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across\nsix applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are\ncapable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require\nsignificant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role.\nExpert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less\nexploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a\nspecific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based\nlearning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability.\n  Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling\nalgorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP\napplications. The approach can also be extended to MPI-based programs, enabling\noptimization of scheduling decisions across multiple levels of parallelism."}

We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning\nframework for learning partial differential equations, with an application\nfocus on chaotic systems. A quantum circuit Born machine is employed to learn\nthe invariant properties of chaotic dynamical systems, achieving substantial\nmemory efficiency by representing these complex physical statistics with a\ncompact set of trainable circuit parameters. This approach reduces the data\nstorage requirement by over two orders of magnitude compared to the raw\nsimulation data. The resulting statistical quantum-informed prior is then\nincorporated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address issues such\nas gradient vanishing or explosion, while maintaining long-term statistical\nfidelity. The framework is evaluated on three representative systems: the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and turbulent\nchannel flow.

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nAQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed\nto support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this\neffort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic\nFramework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a\ncombination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated\nevaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations\nin aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools."}

The system's tractability is predicated not on\nconvexity, but on a global analytic hypothesis: the existence of a unique and\nglobally Lipschitz maximizer map for the driver function. Under this\nhypothesis, which carves out a tractable class of models, we establish\nwell-posedness via a fixed-point argument.

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nAQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed\nto support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this\neffort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic\nFramework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a\ncombination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated\nevaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations\nin aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools."}

Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially\nobservable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,\nself-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \\emph{learned} to\nmean-squared error $\\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,\nthe probability of violating \\emph{any} safety property is bounded while still\nensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,\nwhich merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience\nand impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended\nsettings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether\nan arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by\nreduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable\nisland'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and\nverified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.\nConsequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage\nand generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality\nrather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation\nguidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems."}

However, when these fail to capture all confounding information, the\nmethod may be subject to confounding bias. We therefore introduce two\ntheoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the\nconfounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment\neffects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When\nthese structured measurements are only available for a non-representative\nsubset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias. To address\nthis, we further introduce a regression-based correction that accounts for the\nnon-uniform sampling, assuming the sampling mechanism is known or can be\nwell-estimated. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the plug-in\nmethod, directly trainable on large unstructured datasets, achieves strong\nempirical performance across all settings, despite its simplicity."}

However, the safety\nmechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual\nmodalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this\ncross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors\napplied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These\ntensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without\nmodifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset\ncontaining (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive\nbenign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the\npurpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)\ngeneral benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance\nLVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining\nnear-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards\nhidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully\nactivate the language module's textual \"safety layers\" in visual inputs,\nthereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality."}

Will be Submitted to ICLR 2025 for\n  review", "summary": "In real-world machine learning deployments, models must be continually\nupdated, composed, and when required, selectively undone. However, existing\napproaches to model merging and continual learning often suffer from task\ninterference, catastrophic forgetting, or lack of reversibility. We propose\nModular Delta Merging with Orthogonal Constraints (MDM-OC), a novel framework\nthat enables scalable, interference-free, and reversible composition of\nfine-tuned models. Each task-specific model is encoded as a delta from a shared\nbase and projected into an orthogonal subspace to eliminate conflict. These\nprojected deltas are then merged via gradient-based optimization to form a\nunified model that retains performance across tasks. Our approach supports\ncontinual integration of new models, structured unmerging for compliance such\nas GDPR requirements, and model stability via elastic weight consolidation and\nsynthetic replay. Extensive experiments on vision and natural language\nprocessing benchmarks demonstrate that MDM-OC outperforms prior baselines in\naccuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity, while remaining\nmemory-efficient and computationally tractable. This framework offers a\nprincipled solution for modular and compliant AI system design."}

We introduce Compositional Function Networks (CFNs), a novel\nframework that builds inherently interpretable models by composing elementary\nmathematical functions with clear semantics. Unlike existing interpretable\napproaches that are limited to simple additive structures, CFNs support diverse\ncompositional patterns -- sequential, parallel, and conditional -- enabling\ncomplex feature interactions while maintaining transparency. A key innovation\nis that CFNs are fully differentiable, allowing efficient training through\nstandard gradient descent. We demonstrate CFNs' versatility across multiple\ndomains, from symbolic regression to image classification with deep\nhierarchical networks. Our empirical evaluation shows CFNs achieve competitive\nperformance against black-box models (96.24% accuracy on CIFAR-10) while\noutperforming state-of-the-art interpretable models like Explainable Boosting\nMachines. By combining the hierarchical expressiveness and efficient training\nof deep learning with the intrinsic interpretability of well-defined\nmathematical functions, CFNs offer a powerful framework for applications where\nboth performance and accountability are paramount."}

We analyze the impact of adapting different weight\nmatrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity\nand memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA) fine-tuning.\n  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more\nsignificantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower\nperplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)\nHigher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns\nat higher ranks.\n  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance\nand privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for\ndeveloping more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large\nlanguage models while managing data privacy concerns."}
