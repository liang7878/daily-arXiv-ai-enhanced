The principal must design\na contract to incentivize the agent. Is there still an approximation scheme? In\nthis work, our ultimate goal is an algorithm-to-contract transformation, which\ntransforms algorithms for combinatorial problems (like budgeted maximization)\nto tackle incentive constraints that arise in contract design. Our approach\ndiverges from previous works on combinatorial contract design by avoiding an\nassumption of black-box access to a demand oracle.\n  We first show how to \"lift\" the FPTAS for budgeted maximization to obtain the\nbest-possible multiplicative and additive FPTAS for the contract design\nproblem. We establish this through our \"local-global\" framework, in which the\n\"local\" step is to (approximately) solve a two-sided strengthened variant of\nthe demand problem.

Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components.

To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),\ncan be used to leverage information across related domains. An important\nconsideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based\nmetrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.\nThus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is\nto identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for\nwhich the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.\nGenerally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain\nexpertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on\nthe dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial.

While previous research has\ndocumented substantial wage premiums for AI-related roles due to growing demand\nand limited talent supply, our study asks whether this demand also translates\ninto enhanced non-monetary compensation. We find that AI roles are\nsignificantly more likely to offer such perks, even after controlling for\neducation requirements, industry, and occupation type. It is twice as likely\nfor an AI role to offer parental leave and almost three times more likely to\nprovide remote working options. Moreover, the highest-paying AI roles tend to\nbundle these benefits, suggesting a compound premium where salary increases\ncoincide with expanded non-monetary rewards. AI roles offering parental leave\nor health benefits show salaries that are, on average, 12% to 20% higher than\nAI roles without this benefit.

By leveraging the semantic\nframework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies\n(CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be\norganized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then\nused to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based\non the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term\n`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.\nAdditionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,\nwhich conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic\nconcept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an\nalternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process\nprofiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,\nwe demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be\nseamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis\nand decision-making.

A forward problem predicts the\noutput of a network for a given input by optimizing weights and biases. An\ninverse problem finds equation parameters or coefficients that effectively\nmodel the data. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both\nproblems. PINNs inject prior analytical information about the data into the\ncost function to improve model performance outside the training set boundaries.\nThis also allows PINNs to efficiently solve problems with sparse data without\noverfitting by extrapolating the model to fit larger trends in the data. The\nprior information we implement is in the form of differential equations.\nResiduals are the differences between the left-hand and right-hand sides of\ncorresponding differential equations; PINNs minimize these residuals to\neffectively solve the differential equation and take advantage of prior\nknowledge. In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss\nfunction and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the\nmodel parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and\ninverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with\nresiduals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and\nthen expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex\ndifferential equations.

A graph with\nmillions of edges can have trillions of temporal motifs, since the same edge\ncan occur with multiple timestamps. There is a combinatorial explosion of\npossibilities, and state-of-the-art algorithms cannot manage motifs with more\nthan four vertices.\n  In this work, we present TIMEST: a general, fast, and accurate estimation\nalgorithm to count temporal motifs of arbitrary sizes in temporal networks. Our\napproach introduces a temporal spanning tree sampler that leverages weighted\nsampling to generate substructures of target temporal motifs. This method\ncarefully takes a subset of temporal constraints of the motif that can be\njointly and efficiently sampled. TIMEST uses randomized estimation techniques\nto obtain accurate estimates of motif counts.\n  We give theoretical guarantees on the running time and approximation\nguarantees of TIMEST. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and show\nthat TIMEST is both faster and more accurate than previous algorithms. Our CPU\nimplementation exhibits an average speedup of 28x over state-of-the-art GPU\nimplementation of the exact algorithm, and 6x speedup over SOTA approximate\nalgorithms while consistently showcasing less than 5% error in most cases. For\nexample, TIMEST can count the number of instances of a financial fraud temporal\nmotif in four minutes with 0.6% error, while exact methods take more than two\ndays."}

A promising direction for obtaining\nconditional dependence for conformal sets--in particular capturing\nheteroskedasticity--is through estimating the conditional density\n$\\mathbb{P}_{Y|X}$ and conformalizing its level sets. Previous work in this\nvein has focused on nonconformity scores based on the empirical cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF). Such scores are, however, computationally costly,\ntypically requiring expensive sampling methods. To avoid the need for sampling,\nwe observe that the CDF-based score reduces to a Mahalanobis distance in the\ncase of Gaussian scores, yielding a closed-form expression that can be directly\nconformalized. Moreover, the use of a Gaussian-based score opens the door to a\nnumber of extensions of the basic conformal method; in particular, we show how\nto construct conformal sets with missing output values, refine conformal sets\nas partial information about $Y$ becomes available, and construct conformal\nsets on transformations of the output space.

However, relying solely on gradient information, these\nmethods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,\nplateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature\ninformation from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are\ncomputationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order\ntechnique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry\nof a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only\ngradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for\nlocating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel\nframework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the\nDimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating\nthe Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By\nperiodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the\nminimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points\nand flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.\nPreliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves\ncompetitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving\nnavigation of complex loss landscapes.

Recent advances have\nshown that leveraging auxiliary datasets, such as those synthesized by\ngenerative models, can improve the accuracy of these value estimates.\nUnfortunately, such auxiliary datasets may also be biased, and existing methods\nfor using data augmentation for OPE in RL lack principled uncertainty\nquantification. In high stakes settings like healthcare, reliable uncertainty\nestimates are important for comparing policy value estimates. In this work, we\npropose two approaches to construct valid confidence intervals for OPE when\nusing data augmentation. The first provides a confidence interval over the\npolicy performance conditioned on a particular initial state $V^{\\pi}(s_0)$--\nsuch intervals are particularly important for human-centered applications. To\ndo so we introduce a new conformal prediction method for high dimensional state\nMDPs. Second, we consider the more common task of estimating the average policy\nperformance over many initial states; to do so we draw on ideas from doubly\nrobust estimation and prediction powered inference. Across simulators spanning\nrobotics, healthcare and inventory management, and a real healthcare dataset\nfrom MIMIC-IV, we find that our methods can use augmented data and still\nconsistently produce intervals that cover the ground truth values, unlike\npreviously proposed methods."}

However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model.

To mitigate\nthese challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator\n(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate\ncontext-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and\nadaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.\nOur experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG\noutperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in\nterms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the\ncalculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL\nnetwork."}

Accurate property prediction\nfor polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.\nHowever, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by\nthe constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,\nsince the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,\nwe propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training\nframework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and\nintegrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.\nFrom the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)\nand graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we\ndemonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to\napplying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose\nto further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).\nMoreover, we show the robustness of the \"star linking\" strategy through Repeat\nand Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, \"star linking\"\nstrategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,\na common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)\ntest. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the\ncapability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences.

We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage.

Robustness is further enhanced through an\nensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and\nan F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming\nindividual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying\nthe diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated\nCVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or\nscanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid\nand accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases\nthat often demand urgent care."}

To this end, we first introduce an approximate\n'plug-in' method trained directly on the neural representations of unstructured\ndata. However, when these fail to capture all confounding information, the\nmethod may be subject to confounding bias. We therefore introduce two\ntheoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the\nconfounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment\neffects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When\nthese structured measurements are only available for a non-representative\nsubset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias.

Second-order methods, which use curvature\ninformation from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are\ncomputationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order\ntechnique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry\nof a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only\ngradient information.

While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)\nand data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to\nenhance model performance, they are not without complications.

However, existing\napproaches often face trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.\nTo address these challenges, we propose 1D-CGS, a lightweight and effective\nhybrid model that integrates the speed of one-dimensional convolutional neural\nnetworks (1D-CNN) with the topological representation power of GraphSAGE for\nefficient node ranking. The model uses a lightweight input representation built\non two straightforward and significant topological features: node degree and\naverage neighbor degree. These features are processed through 1D convolutions\nto extract local patterns, followed by GraphSAGE layers to aggregate\nneighborhood information. We formulate the node ranking task as a regression\nproblem and use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to generate\nground truth influence scores. 1D-CGS is initially trained on synthetic\nnetworks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and then applied to real world\nnetworks for identifying influential nodes. Experimental evaluations on twelve\nreal world networks demonstrate that 1D-CGS significantly outperforms\ntraditional centrality measures and recent deep learning models in ranking\naccuracy, while operating in very fast runtime. The proposed model achieves an\naverage improvement of 4.73% in Kendall's Tau correlation and 7.67% in Jaccard\nSimilarity over the best performing deep learning baselines. It also achieves\nan average Monotonicity Index (MI) score 0.99 and produces near perfect rank\ndistributions, indicating highly unique and discriminative rankings.\nFurthermore, all experiments confirm that 1D-CGS operates in a highly\nreasonable time, running significantly faster than existing deep learning\nmethods, making it suitable for large scale applications."}

While quantum machine learning offers a\npromising route to efficiently capture physical properties from\nhigh-dimensional data, its practical deployment is hindered by current hardware\nnoise and limited scalability. We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning\nframework for learning partial differential equations, with an application\nfocus on chaotic systems. A quantum circuit Born machine is employed to learn\nthe invariant properties of chaotic dynamical systems, achieving substantial\nmemory efficiency by representing these complex physical statistics with a\ncompact set of trainable circuit parameters. This approach reduces the data\nstorage requirement by over two orders of magnitude compared to the raw\nsimulation data. The resulting statistical quantum-informed prior is then\nincorporated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address issues such\nas gradient vanishing or explosion, while maintaining long-term statistical\nfidelity. The framework is evaluated on three representative systems: the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and turbulent\nchannel flow. In all cases, the quantum-informed model achieves superior\nperformance compared to its classical counterparts without quantum priors. This\nhybrid architecture offers a practical route for learning dynamical systems\nusing near-term quantum hardware."}

For MPM, we\ndemonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to\napplying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose\nto further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).\nMoreover, we show the robustness of the \"star linking\" strategy through Repeat\nand Shift Invariance Test (RSIT).

Specifically, we introduce sine activation into\nthe DL model to restore the broadband nature of PARF signals given the observed\nband-limited and high-frequency PARF data. Given the scarcity of 3D training\ndata, we employ simplified training strategies by simulating random spherical\nabsorbers. This combination of sine-activated model and randomized training is\ndesigned to emphasize bandwidth learning over dataset memorization. Our model\nwas evaluated on a leaf skeleton phantom, a micro-CT-verified 3D spiral phantom\nand in-vivo human palm vasculature.

We propose a supervised\nfine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic\nreasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two\nstylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on\nindividual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of\nKantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis).\nWe find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior\ntoward the corresponding economic agent. We further assess the fine-tuned\nagents' behavior in two applications: Moral dilemmas involving autonomous\nvehicles and algorithmic pricing in competitive markets. These examples\nillustrate how different normative objectives embedded via realizations from\nstructured preference structures can influence market and moral outcomes. This\nwork contributes a replicable, cost-efficient, and economically grounded\npipeline to align AI preferences using moral-economic principles."}

Will be Submitted to ICLR 2025 for\n  review", "summary": "In real-world machine learning deployments, models must be continually\nupdated, composed, and when required, selectively undone. However, existing\napproaches to model merging and continual learning often suffer from task\ninterference, catastrophic forgetting, or lack of reversibility. We propose\nModular Delta Merging with Orthogonal Constraints (MDM-OC), a novel framework\nthat enables scalable, interference-free, and reversible composition of\nfine-tuned models. Each task-specific model is encoded as a delta from a shared\nbase and projected into an orthogonal subspace to eliminate conflict. These\nprojected deltas are then merged via gradient-based optimization to form a\nunified model that retains performance across tasks. Our approach supports\ncontinual integration of new models, structured unmerging for compliance such\nas GDPR requirements, and model stability via elastic weight consolidation and\nsynthetic replay. Extensive experiments on vision and natural language\nprocessing benchmarks demonstrate that MDM-OC outperforms prior baselines in\naccuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity, while remaining\nmemory-efficient and computationally tractable. This framework offers a\nprincipled solution for modular and compliant AI system design."}

We introduce Compositional Function Networks (CFNs), a novel\nframework that builds inherently interpretable models by composing elementary\nmathematical functions with clear semantics. Unlike existing interpretable\napproaches that are limited to simple additive structures, CFNs support diverse\ncompositional patterns -- sequential, parallel, and conditional -- enabling\ncomplex feature interactions while maintaining transparency. A key innovation\nis that CFNs are fully differentiable, allowing efficient training through\nstandard gradient descent. We demonstrate CFNs' versatility across multiple\ndomains, from symbolic regression to image classification with deep\nhierarchical networks. Our empirical evaluation shows CFNs achieve competitive\nperformance against black-box models (96.24% accuracy on CIFAR-10) while\noutperforming state-of-the-art interpretable models like Explainable Boosting\nMachines. By combining the hierarchical expressiveness and efficient training\nof deep learning with the intrinsic interpretability of well-defined\nmathematical functions, CFNs offer a powerful framework for applications where\nboth performance and accountability are paramount."}

We examine how different aspects of the\nfine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data,\nusing the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.\n  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to\ndetect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess\nverbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight\nmatrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity\nand memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA) fine-tuning.\n  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more\nsignificantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower\nperplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)\nHigher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns\nat higher ranks.\n  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance\nand privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for\ndeveloping more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large\nlanguage models while managing data privacy concerns."}
