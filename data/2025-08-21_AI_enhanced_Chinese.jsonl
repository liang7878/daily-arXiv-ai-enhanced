While direct training methods tackle the challenge of\nnon-differentiable activation mechanisms in SNNs, they often suffer from high\ncomputational and energy costs during training. As a result, ANN-to-SNN\nconversion approach still remains a valuable and practical alternative. These\nconversion-based methods aim to leverage the discrete output produced by the\nquantization layer to obtain SNNs with low latency. Although the theoretical\nminimum latency is one timestep, existing conversion methods have struggled to\nrealize such ultra-low latency without accuracy loss. Moreover, current\nquantization approaches often discard negative-value information following\nbatch normalization and are highly sensitive to the hyperparameter\nconfiguration, leading to degraded performance. In this work, we, for the first\ntime, analyze the information loss introduced by quantization layers through\nthe lens of information entropy. Building on our analysis, we introduce\nPolarity Multi-Spike Mapping (PMSM) and a hyperparameter adjustment strategy\ntailored for the quantization layer. Our method achieves nearly lossless\nANN-to-SNN conversion at the extremity, i.e., the first timestep, while also\nleveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs across multiple timesteps to maintain\nstable performance on complex tasks. Experimental results show that our PMSM\nachieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.5% on CIFAR-10, 89.3% on CIFAR-100\nand 81.6% on ImageNet with only one timestep on ViT-S architecture,\nestablishing a new benchmark for efficient conversion.

In this paper, we propose DP2Rec, a novel\nDual-Phase Playtime-guided Recommendation model designed to jointly optimize\naccuracy and diversity. First, we introduce a playtime-guided interest\nintensity exploration module that separates strong and weak preferences via\ndual-beta modeling, enabling fine-grained user profiling and more accurate\nrecommendations. Second, we present a playtime-guided multimodal random walks\nmodule that simulates player exploration using transitions guided by both\nplaytime-derived interest similarity and multimodal semantic similarity. This\nmechanism preserves core preferences while promoting cross-category discovery\nthrough latent semantic associations and adaptive category balancing. Extensive\nexperiments on a real-world game dataset show that DP2Rec outperforms existing\nmethods in both recommendation accuracy and diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u884c\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51faDP2Rec\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6e38\u620f\u884c\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u76ee\u5f55\u6269\u5c55\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDP2Rec\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u957f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDP2Rec\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DP2Rec\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Detecting and\nquantifying this phenomenon is key to understanding evolution of traits ranging\nfrom multicellularity to pathogen virulence. Multilevel selection is\nparticularly important in artificial life research due to its connection to\nmajor evolutionary transitions, a hallmark of open-ended evolution. Bonetti\nFranceschi & Volz (2024) proposed to detect multilevel selection dynamics by\nscreening for mutations that appear more often in a population than expected by\nchance (due to individual-level fitness benefits) but are ultimately associated\nwith negative longer-term fitness outcomes (i.e., smaller, shorter-lived\ndescendant clades). Here, we use agent-based modeling with known ground truth\nto assess the efficacy of this approach. To test these methods under\nchallenging conditions broadly comparable to the original dataset explored by\nBonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024), we use an epidemiological framework to model\nmultilevel selection in trade-offs between within-host growth rate and\nbetween-host transmissibility. To achieve success on our in silico data, we\ndevelop an alternate normalization procedure for identifying clade-level\nfitness effects.

Based on these insights, the paper further introduces\nthe \"Agent for Agent (A4A)\" paradigm and the \"Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity\n(HABD)\" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and\nagent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,\nintention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.\nThe effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red\nteam penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future\nresearch directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral\ndisparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to\nprovide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and\ntrustworthy human-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u8bf8\u591a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7f51\u7edc\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u3001A4A\u8303\u5f0f\u548cHABD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3AI\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u754c\u9650\u6a21\u7cca\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u7f51\u7edc\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u201d\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u201cA4A\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u201cHABD\u201d\u6a21\u578b\u4ece5\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u7528\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea2\u961f\u6e17\u900f\u3001\u84dd\u961f\u9632\u5fa1\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u6cbb\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5143\u6cbb\u7406\u534f\u8bae\u6808\u7b49\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u7ebf\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose PyloChain, a hierarchical sharded\nblockchain that balances availability and performance.

The main chain leverages a directed-acyclic-graph\n(DAG)-based mempool to guarantee local block availability and to enable\nefficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to execute global (or\ncross-shard) transactions within a collocated sharding. PyloChain speculatively\nexecutes local transactions across multiple local chains to achieve high\nparallelism. In order to reduce the number of aborted local transactions,\nPyloChain applies a simple scheduling technique to handle global transactions\nin the main chain. PyloChain provides a fine-grained auditing mechanism to\nmitigate faulty higher-level members by externalizing main chain operations to\nlower-level local members.

However, effective decision making\nremains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among\ncompeting goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)\nrequires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental\nconditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies\nfrequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.\nExisting methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent\ncoordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we\nintroduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates\nknowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven\noptimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from\nmulti-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We\nevaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three\nrepresentative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily\nlight rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and\nreinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and\nsystem robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,\nknowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban\nflood response.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6781\u7aef\u57ce\u5e02\u964d\u96e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9891\u53d1\u6311\u6218\u5e94\u6025\u8c03\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51faH - J\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u6d2a\u6c34\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6781\u7aef\u57ce\u5e02\u964d\u96e8\u4f7f\u5e94\u6025\u8c03\u5ea6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6743\u8861\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u7edf\u4e00\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165H - J\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u71b5\u7ea6\u675f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4ece\u591a\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u964d\u96e8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9H - J\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u589e\u5f3a\u57ce\u5e02\u6d2a\u6c34\u54cd\u5e94\u6062\u590d\u529b\u6709\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, a wealth of carbon-aware\ncomputing methods have been proposed, yet little work has focused specifically\non scientific workflows, even though they present a substantial opportunity for\ncarbon-aware computing because they are often significantly delay tolerant,\nefficiently interruptible, highly scalable and widely heterogeneous.

However, their\ntheoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains\nunderexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are\ngoverned by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a\nsystem of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are\ngoverned by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing\nconvergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present\nthe first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the\nconvergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph\ngeneration paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)\ngraph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation\nof both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique\nfactors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph\nstructure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer\ntheoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling\nsteps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to\nimprove convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a\ncontrolled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align\nwith our theoretical predictions.

While IIA violations have been\ndetected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has\nreceived scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the\nchoice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for\nIIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the\nframework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our\nmain technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its\nmere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to\nelicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the\nsame item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both\ndatasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.\nFurther, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity.

For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as\ncontour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out\nsmall-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations,\nsimplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than\npersistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting\nregular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data\nonto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a\nhigh sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for\nprocessing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to\nparcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using\nDelaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input.

We\nenvisage that Preguss paves a compelling path towards the automated\nverification of large-scale programs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPreguss\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7a0b\u5e8f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u65ad\u590d\u6742\u8fc7\u7a0b\u95f4\u89c4\u8303\u800c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684Preguss\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u534f\u540c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6f14\u7ece\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6f5c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5355\u5143\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u5355\u5143\u7ea7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u95f4\u89c4\u8303\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Preguss\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

This approach utilizes a system's process data, in\nconjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations.\nThese explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface\ninformation, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to\nunderstand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes.\nHere, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based\nJava system.

However, due to the limitations of earlier models,\ntraditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack\nsufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for\nevaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,\ncharacterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world\nknowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.\nSecondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via\nfine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and\nanti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics\nto systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate\n16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results\nshowing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual\ngrounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual\nunderstanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are\nsignificantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely\naffect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.\nWe anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards\ndeveloping more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding\nframeworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal\nsystems for complex real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6KnowDR - REC\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfREC\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6KnowDR - REC\uff0c\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u542b\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e09\u4e2a\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3016\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u53d7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6377\u5f84\u5173\u8054\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

This mitigates the risk of\nusers or items with fewer records being overwhelmed in sparse scenarios.\nExtensive experimental results affirm the efficacy of GSVR in assisting\nexisting multi-scenario recommendation methods in learning more robust\nrepresentations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u7535\u5546\u591a\u573a\u666f\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGSVR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u52a9\u529b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7535\u5546\u591a\u573a\u666f\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u5e95\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u963b\u788d\u6355\u6349\u573a\u666f\u72ec\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GSVR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u9879\u5206\u5e03\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8c03\u8282\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eGSVR\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u573a\u666f\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "GSVR\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u573a\u666f\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These arise\ndue to the high variability in power consumption during the training. Given the\nsynchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a\ncomputation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a\ncommunication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because\ncompute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large\npower swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with\nthe increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from\nthe frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical\nfrequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid\ninfrastructure. Therefore, to continue scaling AI training workloads safely, we\nneed to stabilize the power of such workloads.

The standard way that PBT users\ngenerate test inputs is via generators that describe how to sample test inputs\nthrough random choices. To achieve a good distribution over test inputs, users\nmust tune their generators, i.e., decide on the weights of these individual\nrandom choices. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to understand how to choose\nindividual generator weights in order to achieve a desired distribution, so\ntoday this process is tedious and limits the distributions that can be\npractically achieved.\n  In this paper, we develop techniques for the automatic and offline tuning of\ngenerators. Given a generator with undetermined symbolic weights and an\nobjective function, our approach automatically learns values for these weights\nthat optimize for the objective. We describe useful objective functions that\nallow users to (1) target desired distributions and (2) improve the diversity\nand validity of their test cases. We have implemented our approach in a novel\ndiscrete probabilistic programming system, Loaded Dice, that supports\ndifferentiation and parameter learning, and use it as a language for\ngenerators.

Thus,\nrecommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into\naccount user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of\nsuch complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a\nnew paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search\nscenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service,\nan end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as\nthere are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make\nfull use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance\nmultiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and\nstores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we\npropose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different\nperspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic\ninformation for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder\nleverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3)\nneighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for\ngeneration.

The final version is available\n  at IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine\nlearning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced\ncommunication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model\noutputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing\nmethods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require\nclients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally\nexpensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side\nfiltering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that\nreduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes\nthe need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based\ndensity ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality\nof knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,\nincluding strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,\nwithout requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge\ndistillation.

While traditional anomaly detection methods\nprimarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at\nhome at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in\ncollective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home\nalone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.\nUnlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling\nspatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional\ncomplexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to\ncapture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first\nformulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences\n(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event\nsequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention\nmechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions\nacross multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior\ndata through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to\ndetect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies\nand absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior\nwork. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that\nCoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving\nan improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

Hypergraph neural\nnetworks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn\nlatent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive\ntasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small\nnumber of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then\nutilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a\ncost, as the representations only capture local information and forego\nlong-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly\nincreasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also\ndegrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.\n  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture\nlong-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.\nDespite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency\nissues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing\nhypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more\ninformation to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit\nHypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns\nfixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end\nmanner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we\nintroduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model\nefficiently.

To\naddress these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,\nwhich incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling\n(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with\nthe capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware\nActivation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's\ninteraction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)\nCertainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token\nscores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight\nquantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves\nsignificant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "DLLMs\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eDLLMs\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDLLMQuant\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3DLLMs\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eDLLMs\u65f6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDLLMQuant\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bTMAS\u3001IA - AQ\u3001CGQ\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "DLLMQuant\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DLLMQuant\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3DLLMs\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and\nsearch-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function\nlearned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding\ndownstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement\nlearning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to\nlearn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely\neliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the\nresulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a\nheuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning\nchain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including\nmathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our\nunified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,\nmatching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,\nour PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.\nThese results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best\nPRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex\nreasoning tasks in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAIRL - S\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eRL\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u4f5c\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u7684RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u6807\u7b7e\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08AIRL\uff09\u548c\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b66\u4e60\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRM\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad89%\uff0c\u5339\u914dGPT - 4o\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0cPRM\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u7528\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebfPRM\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u6700\u4f73PRM\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance\nclimate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble\n(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under\ndifferent FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent\nbaselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and\nmid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to\ntransfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited\nfor geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a\nscalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for\nphysically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a\nchanging climate.

Existing theoretical studies on the\nlearning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning\nalgorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude\nconnection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum\ndegree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk\n(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the\ngeneralization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional\nsettings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine\nhow graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several\nkey contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure\nand learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and\nRidge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure\nthrough spectral graph theory.

A valuable\nstep in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform\npatrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching\nprediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the\nexpressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent\nadvances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more\nflexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data\nfaces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited\ndata.

Existing HOI generation approaches, such as\ndiffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible\ncontacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder\nsuccessful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of\ngenerative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and\nphysically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion\nTransformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,\nobject geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These\nkey actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into\nsmooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To\nensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy\ntrained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while\ncorrecting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the\ncontrol policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and\ntracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates\nrealistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,\nachieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and\nenabling long-horizon manipulation tasks.

This method should ease the\nclinical workflow of preoperative planning.\n  Methods: Manual segmentation was performed on hepatobiliary phase MRI scans\nfrom 90 consecutive patients who underwent liver surgery between January 2020\nand October 2023. A deep learning network (nnU-Net v1) was trained on 72\npatients with an extra focus on thin structures and topography preservation.\nPerformance was evaluated on an 18-patient test set by comparing automated and\nmanual segmentations using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC).

DuPO addresses\ntwo key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s\nreliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and\ntraditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,\ntranslation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal\ntask's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task\nto reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information\n(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening\napplicability to non-invertible tasks.

LLM inference is an online and multi-task\nservice process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM\nprocesses input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,\nit is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power\nconsumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key\nchallenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known\nupon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and\nprocessing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms\nthat leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the\nprediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each\nrequest.\n  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\max}$, which\nschedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to\nprevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as\nprediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to\npotential overestimation.

For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private\ninformation or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such\nincidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent\nfuture occurrences.

In particular, such processes are\nlargely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but\npotentially sensitive, information such as an agent's chain of thought or\nbrowser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting\nprocesses, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on\nsystems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that\ncan cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual\n(e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user\nrequest). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which\nfactors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation\nand access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide\nrecommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2)\nwhat information developers and deployers should retain and make available to\nincident investigators upon request.

The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to\nmodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.\nHowever, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy.

Despite being a\nsecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to\nthat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved\nby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently\napproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the\napproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower\napproximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive\nexperiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark\ndatasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset\nselection.

However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs\ncan exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.\nMoreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and\nmessage-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias\nby filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge\ndropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may\nunintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised\nbalance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we\npresent a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias\nmitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using\ncounterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node\nrepresentations learning from the augmented graph.

This study analyzes the spectral\ndistribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that\nthe heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low\nto high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral\nneural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection\non heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into\nhomophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions.

However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the\ngradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update\nof multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more\nbecause of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class\nrelational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not\nsacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact\nthat an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate\nis attached to a car in a similar position).

While large language models (LLMs) have shown great\npromise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation\nclassification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related\nentity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine\nwhether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence\nstructures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such\nhallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the\nintegrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware\nsEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the\nrelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,\nDEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for\neach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence\ninto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise\nwhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local\npredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,\ncorrecting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a\ncausality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling\nspurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning\nwith human feedback.

Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs\nremain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers\nappended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on\ninefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of\ncontinuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to\nselected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary\nmodels. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete\ntokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.\nWe propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed\none-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient\ndescent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot\nencoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We\nprovide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement\nan efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.\nOur method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to\nthree state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four\nadversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods.

While such scaling has been well studied for\nlanguage modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in\nthis regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,\nvalue-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute\nallocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed\ncompute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes\nto maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between\nmodel size, batch size, and UTD.

Recent works have\nhighlighted the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks\noutside of the sole natural language area. In particular, recent approaches\nhave investigated coupling LLMs with other data modalities by using pre-trained\nbackbones and different fusion mechanisms. This work proposes a novel approach\nthat fine-tunes an LLM with audio and text representations for emotion\nprediction. Our method first extracts audio features using an audio feature\nextractor, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a\nlearnable interfacing module.

This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel\nconceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as\na tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of\nescalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an\nAdaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a\nCo-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator.

The paper further engages in a\ncritical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration,\nexamining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared\nintentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while\nAI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed\nas a highly effective functional collaborator.

However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains\nchallenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.\nWhile post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted\ntechnique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely\nunexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing\ndiffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of\nactivation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that\ndominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit\nquantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority\nof values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model\nvariants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,\nquantization method, task category, and model type. Through this\nmulti-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization\nbehavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide\na foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and\nexperimental setups will be released to support the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "dLLMs\u56e0\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\uff08PTQ\uff09\u5bf9dLLMs\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5148\u8fdbPTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u4f4d\u5bbd\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97dLLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u6548dLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}
