In these areas, predictive modeling\nover relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on\nreducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.\nThis raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be\nautomated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?\n  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature\naugmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features\nextracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN\nfirst captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table\nattribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,\nsemantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted\ngraph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,\nReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate\ninformation through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the\noriginal dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and\nsynthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing\nmethods on both classification and regression tasks."}

We study the\ngeneral model of Costly Information Combinatorial Selection (CICS) that was\nrecently introduced by Chawla et al. [2024] and Bowers et al. [2025]. In this\nproblem, a decision maker needs to select a feasible subset of stochastic\nvariables, and can only learn information about their values through a series\nof costly steps, modeled by a Markov decision process. The algorithmic\nobjective is to maximize the total value of the selection minus the cost of\ninformation acquisition. However, determining the optimal algorithm is known to\nbe a computationally challenging problem.\n  To address this challenge, previous approaches have turned to approximation\nalgorithms by considering a restricted class of committing policies that\nsimplify the decision-making aspects of the problem and allow for efficient\noptimization. This motivates the question of bounding the commitment gap,\nmeasuring the worst case ratio in the performance of the optimal committing\npolicy and the overall optimal.\n  In this work, we obtain improved bounds on the commitment gap of CICS through\na reduction to a simpler problem of Bayesian Combinatorial Selection where\ninformation is free. By establishing a close relationship between these\nproblems, we are able to relate the commitment gap of CICS to ex ante\nfree-order prophet inequalities.

Despite accounting for just approximately\n5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x\nperformance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from\nthe complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core\nsystems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading\nto cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.\nOffloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a\npotential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache\npollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for\nmulti-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators\nremains a significant challenge.\n  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory\nallocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a\nlightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data\nsynchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This\ndesign minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for\ncross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core\ninstead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting\nnew allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software\nand hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and\nMemento.

However,\nensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant\nchallenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource\nrequirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload\ntransformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models\non individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either\nconsiderable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy\nand efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative\ninference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer.

To\naddress this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and\nscalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful\ntraining samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a\nheld-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample\nloss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient\nand curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We\ndevelop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees\nfor CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is\nupper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the\nrepresentativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,\nCLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art\nmethods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally\nexpensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across\narchitectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with\n<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,\nincurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias\nreduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional\nstratified sampling.

In this article, we propose assertion-based test\noracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the\ninputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test\noracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,\nfails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe\ntwo methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic\nprogramming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization\n(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness\nfunctions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR).

Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations\ncharacterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and\nvarying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and\nconvergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional\ntimetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key\ninnovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by\naugmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station\nID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,\nvelocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to\ncapture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs\ninto a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function\naligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway\ndeviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule\nadherence.

The\ncurrent naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited\nbiological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.\nWe investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine\nlearning EEG analysis.\n  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that\ncreates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG\ndata and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that\ntypically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable\nsynthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG\nmethod has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying\nit to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG\nwith fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG\nmachine learning pipeline for seizure detection.\n  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure\ndetection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using\na standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and\nrequires fewer segments.\n  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG\ncan be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to\nimprove performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation\nfor signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard\npreprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications."}

While online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS)\nmitigates this issue via latent factor analysis-based imputation, existing\nmethods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to\ninflexible models and degraded performance. To address these gaps, this work\nproposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection\nframework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach\nintroduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label\nrelationships; 2) Three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in\nsupervised learning.

However, these techniques alter the input graph's global\ntopology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph\nstructure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This\nstudy presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate\nthe effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global\nstructure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the\nnode centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,\nthe proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with\nlikely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across\nselected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without\nadding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve\nperformance on graph and node classification tasks.

We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories\n(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a\nstandardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different\nlayers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt\nvariations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level\nchanges, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by\nmodifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that\npreserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to\nLLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent\nstage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle\nlayers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers\nprepare task-specific outputs.

Although many works on GFMs have been\nfocused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling\narbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.\nHowever, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in\nthe field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the\nrecent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a\nsimple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.\nSpecifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood\nfeature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to\nthe constructed node representations.

This framework enables the application of\nreinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms to develop dynamic policies based on\nsimulated financial scenarios, regardless of prerequisites. We use the Kelly\ncriterion to balance immediate reward signals against long-term investment\nobjectives, and we take the novel step of integrating the Time-series Dense\nEncoder (TiDE) into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL framework\nfor continuous decision-making. We compare DDPG-TiDE with a simple\ndiscrete-action Q-learning RL framework and a passive buy-and-hold investment\nstrategy.

The\nCHI 2025 workshop on Tools for Thought aimed to bridge an emerging science of\nhow the use of GenAI affects human thought, from metacognition to critical\nthinking, memory, and creativity, with an emerging design practice for building\nGenAI tools that both protect and augment human thought. Fifty-six researchers,\ndesigners, and thinkers from across disciplines as well as industry and\nacademia, along with 34 papers and portfolios, seeded a day of discussion,\nideation, and community-building.

However, existing\nacademic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,\ntypically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing\nimages, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To\nmitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world\nchallenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake\ninvolves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with\nrigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,\nemerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,\nwe propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake\ndetector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce\npattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as\n\"planning\" and \"self-reflection\" to emulate human forensic process. We further\npropose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake\nreasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset\nreveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on\ncross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.\nOur Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is\ncapable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs."}

Even beyond the\nU.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of\noverlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly\npenalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,\nmaking modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We\npropose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate\ntax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging\nStAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for\nestimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties\nfor tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of\nplain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently\nretrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve\nperformance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.\nOur results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic\narchitectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance."}

Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial\nmanipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions\nand background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them\nparticularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in\ndetection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale\nbenchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial\ndeepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level\nmanipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of\ndetection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human\ndetection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar\nperformance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models.

However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context\nvideos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which\nmakes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long\nsequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information\nretrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,\nMixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.\nIn MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory\nanchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that\nprevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the\nrouting, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,\nactions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct\nof retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and\nsynthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes."}
