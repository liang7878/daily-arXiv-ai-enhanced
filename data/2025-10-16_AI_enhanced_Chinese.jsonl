Prior works have focused on leveraging the\ngenerative capabilities of LLMs to improve GR, while overlooking that their\nreasoning capabilities could likewise help.

To investigate, we first conduct a preliminary\nstudy where an LLM is prompted to generate free-form chain-of-thought (CoT)\nreasoning before performing constrained docid decoding.

R4R augments an existing GR method by leveraging a reasoning-capable\nLLM that has been instruction-tuned for GR.

Our human-verified results demonstrate that\nthe RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human\nAlignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.\nFurthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.\nThis work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering\nLLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,\npaving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRID\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u5219\u521a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u521a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u7684\u5143\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u7b49\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRID\u6846\u67b6\u8fbe\u523095%\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u768480%\u548cCoT\u768475%\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u4e14\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u5b9e\u7528\u7684AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Dodoor leverages advanced\nresearch on the weighted balls-into-bins model with b-batched setting. Unlike\nother decentralized schedulers that rely on real-time probing of remote\nservers, Dodoor makes scheduling decisions based on cached server information,\nwhich is updated in batches, to reduce communication overheads. To schedule\ntasks with dynamic, multidimensional resource requirements in heterogeneous\ncluster, Dodoor uses a novel load score to measure servers' loads for each\nscheduled task. This score captures the anti-affinity between servers and tasks\nin contrast to the commonly used heuristic of counting pending tasks to balance\nload. On a 101-node heterogeneous cluster, Dodoor is evaluated using two\nworkloads: (i) simulated Azure virtual machines placements and (ii) real\nserverless Python functions executions in Docker. The evaluation shows that\nDodoor reduces scheduling messages by 55--66% on both workloads. Dodoor can\nalso increase throughput by up to 33.2% and 21.5%, reduce mean makespan latency\nby 12.1% and 7.2%, and improve tail latency by 21.9% and 24.6% across the two\nworkloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u968f\u673a\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668Dodoor\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f13\u5b58\u4fe1\u606f\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6d88\u606f\u91cf\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u7ef4\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u7403\u5165\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4fe1\u606f\u505a\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8bc4\u5206\u8861\u91cf\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "result": "\u5728101\u8282\u70b9\u5f02\u6784\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cDodoor\u51cf\u5c11\u8c03\u5ea6\u6d88\u606f55 - 66%\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe33.2%\u548c21.5%\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e73\u5747\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6539\u5584\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "Dodoor\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The CES\ndefines existence as a reflexive correspondence --'to be' and 'to be\nsayable'--and positions any formal system, including ZFC or HoTT, as an\nattachable extension atop this minimal structure. The IMU functions as a\nregistry of axiomatic dependencies that connect heterogeneous theories,\nemploying the Institution-theoretic framework to ensure coherent\ninter-theoretical linkages. The HSG concretizes these ideas through categorical\nconstruction, defined by three orthogonal axes: the state-depth axis, the\nmapping-hierarchy axis, and the temporal axis incorporating the principle of\n'no future reference.' Through these, the identity of 'definition = state' is\nformally established as a categorical property. Extending this structure to\nbiological systems, the neural system is implemented as a 0-3D complex of\nneuron-function fields on the HSG, while its categorical extensions via\nfiberization over the material base enable the parallel integration of multiple\nphysiological universes-neural, endocrine, learning, genetic, and input/output\nsystems-into a coherent adjoint ensemble. Within this framework, human behavior\nand cognition emerge as temporal compositions of inter-universal algorithms\nconstrained by the material base.

To address the\nchallenges from the large scale models, model compression techniques such as\nlow-rank decomposition have been explored. Previous model decomposition works\nhave focused on weight decomposition to avoid costly runtime decomposition,\nwhose latency often significantly exceeds the benefits from decomposition\n(e.g., 38% more end-to-end latency when running Llama2-7b on A100 with 4K\nsequence length with activation decomposition compared to no decomposition). In\nthis work, we debunk such observations and report that the input decomposition\ncan be significantly beneficial with a proper choice of decomposition algorithm\nand hardware support. We adopt progressive decomposition algorithm, Lanczos\nalgorithm, and design a co-accelerator architecture for the decomposition\nalgorithm. To address the memory- boundness of the decomposition operation, we\nintroduce a novel compute replication methodology that moves the op- eration\ntoward compute-bound region, which enables 6.2x speedup in our evaluation. We\nalso develop an output shape- preserving computation scheme that eliminates\ndecomposi- tion costs in consecutive layers. To compensate model quality loss\nfrom compression, we introduce a multi-track decom- position approach that\nseparately handles outlier channels for high accuracy and low perplexity with\nminimal compu- tational costs.

Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved\naccuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal\nclassification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared\nto about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower\nfor prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or\nexpensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully\ncompatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of\nIntel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for\non-chip learning.

This is no longer the case for connected autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs), which will be able to communicate and collaborate to jointly\nform routing coalitions.\n  We demonstrate this for the first time on a carefully designed toy-network\nexample, where a `club` of three autonomous vehicles jointly decides to deviate\nfrom the user equilibrium and benefit (arrive faster).

Abstract shortened due to arXiv\n  restrictions", "summary": "The starting point of our work is a decade-old open question concerning the\nsubexponential parameterized complexity of \\textsc{2-Layer Crossing\nMinimization}. In this problem, the input is an $n$-vertex graph $G$ whose\nvertices are partitioned into two independent sets $V_1$ and $V_2$, and a\nnon-negative integer $k$. The question is whether $G$ admits a 2-layered\ndrawing with at most $k$ crossings, where each $V_i$ lies on a distinct line\nparallel to the $x$-axis, and all edges are straight lines. We resolve this\nopen question by giving the first subexponential fixed-parameter algorithm for\nthis problem, running in time $2^{O(\\sqrt{k}\\log k)} + n \\cdot k^{O(1)}$.\n  We then ask whether the subexponential phenomenon extends beyond two layers.\nIn the general $h$-Layer Crossing Minimization problem, the vertex set is\npartitioned into $h$ independent sets $V_1, \\ldots, V_h$, and the goal is to\ndecide whether an $h$-layered drawing with at most $k$ crossings exists. We\npresent a subexponential FPT algorithm for three layers with running time\n$2^{O(k^{2/3}\\log k)} + n \\cdot k^{O(1)}$ for $h = 3$ layers.

While LLM-based IR has shown great promise, the prevailing\nretrieve-then-rerank paradigm inherits the limitations of embedding-based\nretrieval; parametric generative approaches are difficult to update with new\ninformation; and long-context methods that place the entire corpus in context\nare computationally infeasible for large document collections. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce LATTICE, a hierarchical retrieval framework that\nenables an LLM to reason over and navigate large corpora with logarithmic\nsearch complexity by imposing a semantic tree structure on the corpus. Our\napproach consists of two stages: (1) an offline phase that organizes the corpus\ninto a semantic hierarchy via either a bottom-up agglomerative strategy or a\ntop-down divisive strategy using multi-level summaries and (2) an online\ntraversal phase where a search LLM navigates this tree. A central challenge in\nsuch LLM-guided search is that the model's relevance judgments are noisy,\ncontext-dependent, and unaware of the hierarchy, making cross-branch and\ncross-level comparisons difficult. To overcome this, we propose a traversal\nalgorithm that estimates calibrated latent relevance scores from local LLM\noutputs and aggregates them into a global path relevance metric. Our\ntraining-free framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the\nreasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, demonstrating up to 9% improvement in\nRecall@100 and 5% in nDCG@10 over the next best zero-shot baseline.\nFurthermore, compared to the fine-tuned SOTA method DIVER-v2, LATTICE attains\ncomparable results on BRIGHT subsets that use a static corpus for evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6LATTICE\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3IR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728BRIGHT\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3IR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u68c0\u7d22\u91cd\u6392\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLATTICE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u6216\u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u8bed\u6599\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u904d\u5386\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba9\u641c\u7d22LLM\u904d\u5386\u6811\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u904d\u5386\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u6821\u51c6\u6f5c\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6570\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728BRIGHT\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6700\u4f18\uff0cRecall@100\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe9%\uff0cnDCG@10\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe5%\uff1b\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5DIVER - v2\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u6599\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684BRIGHT\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "LATTICE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3IR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The problem of setting those\nprices is known to be #P-hard for the original and most well-known AMM, the\nlogarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR) market maker [Chen et al., 2008]. We\nfocus on another natural AMM, the Constant Log Utility Market Maker (CLUM).\nUnlike LMSR, whose worst-case loss bound grows with the number of outcomes,\nCLUM has constant worst-case loss, allowing the market to add outcomes on the\nfly and even operate over countably infinite many outcomes, among other\nfeatures. Simpler versions of CLUM underpin several Decentralized Finance\n(DeFi) mechanisms including the Uniswap protocol that handles billions of\ndollars of cryptocurrency trades daily. We first establish the computational\ncomplexity of the problem: we prove that pricing securities is #P-hard for\nCLUM, via a reduction from the model counting 2-SAT problem.

To obtain valid\nprediction sets in the presence of unseen labels, we compute and integrate into\nour predictions a new family of conformal p-values that can test whether a new\ndata point belongs to a previously unseen class. We study these p-values\ntheoretically, establishing their optimality, and uncover an intriguing\nconnection with the classical Good--Turing estimator for the probability of\nobserving a new species.

We investigate the impact\nof these dynamics on the seller's ability to learn about the buyer and exploit\nthis learning for revenue. We obtain conclusions that differ dramatically with\nthe time horizon of the interactions. To understand short time horizons, we\nanalyze a two-period model, and find that the strategic demand reduction\nobserved with fully sophisticated buyers is robust to the introduction of naive\ntypes. In fact, despite the inability of naive buyers to game the pricing\nalgorithm, their introduction can further harm the seller's revenue, due to\nmore intense demand reduction overall. For long horizons, we consider an\ninfinite-horizon model with time discounting. We find that the extreme demand\nreduction predicted by previous work does not survive the introduction of naive\nbuyers. Instead, we observe equilibria where the seller learns meaningfully\ndespite the sophisticated buyers' demand reduction.

Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama\n2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human\nbrain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels.\nRepresentational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM\nrepresentations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language\nprocessing).

In this paper, we introduce a ratio-based Shapley value that\nreplaces the standard additive formulation with a relative contribution\nmeasure. While our overall reward framework, including the incentive\ndefinitions and model-reward setting, remains aligned with that of Sim and\ncolleagues, the underlying value function is fundamentally different. Our\nalternative valuation induces a different distribution of model rewards and\noffers a new lens through which to analyze incentive properties. We formally\ndefine the ratio-based value and prove that it satisfies the same set of\nincentive conditions as the additive formulation, including adapted versions of\nfairness, individual rationality, and stability.

At the same time, modern deep\nRL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.\nWhile pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its\nrole in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first\ntheoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in\nstate-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and\ncategorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise\npruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the\npolicy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret\ndecomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced\nperformance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental\nperformance--robustness frontier.

This raises two\nchallenges for RAG. First, current RAG methods lack effective time-aware\nrepresentations. Same facts of different time are difficult to distinguish with\nvector embeddings or conventional knowledge graphs. Second, most RAG\nevaluations assume a static corpus, leaving a blind spot regarding update costs\nand retrieval stability as knowledge evolves. To make RAG time-aware, we\npropose Temporal GraphRAG (TG-RAG), which models external corpora as a bi-level\ntemporal graph consisting of a temporal knowledge graph with timestamped\nrelations and a hierarchical time graph. Multi-granularity temporal summaries\nare generated for each time node to capture both key events and broader trends\nat that time. The design supports incremental updates by extracting new\ntemporal facts from the incoming corpus and merging them into the existing\ngraph. The temporal graph explicitly represents identical facts at different\ntimes as distinct edges to avoid ambiguity, and the time hierarchy graph allows\nonly generating reports for new leaf time nodes and their ancestors, ensuring\neffective and efficient updates.

Although envy-freeness has emerged as the\narchetypal fairness notion, envy-free (EF) allocations need not exist with\nindivisible items. To bypass this, a prominent line of research demonstrates\nthat there exist allocations that can be made envy-free by allowing a subsidy.\nExtensive work in the offline setting has focused on finding such envy-freeable\nallocations with bounded subsidy. We extend this literature to an online\nsetting where items arrive one at a time and must be immediately and\nirrevocably allocated. Our contributions are two-fold:\n  1. Maintaining EF Online: We show that envy-freeability cannot always be\npreserved online when the valuations are submodular or supermodular, even with\nbinary marginals. In contrast, we design online algorithms that maintain\nenvy-freeability at every step for the class of additive valuations, and for\nits superclasses including $k$-demand and SPLC valuations.\n  2. Ensuring Low Subsidy: We investigate the quantity of subsidy required to\nguarantee envy-freeness online. Surprisingly, even for additive valuations, the\nminimum subsidy may be as large as $\\Omega(mn)$, in contrast to the offline\nsetting, where the bound is $O(n)$. On the positive side, we identify valuation\nclasses where the minimum subsidy is small (i.e., does not depend on $m$),\nincluding $k$-valued, rank-one, restricted additive, and identical valuations,\nand we obtain (mostly) tight subsidy bounds for these classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7ebf\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u7269\u54c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ef4\u62a4\u5728\u7ebf\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u6027\u548c\u786e\u4fdd\u4f4e\u8865\u8d34\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u6210\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ebf\u4e0b\u5df2\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u6709\u754c\u8865\u8d34\u7684\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u53ef\u5206\u914d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u7269\u54c1\u9010\u4e2a\u5230\u8fbe\u9700\u7acb\u5373\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e0d\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u53ef\u5206\u914d\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u8865\u8d34\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6b21\u6a21\u6216\u8d85\u6a21\u4f30\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u65e0\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4fdd\u6301\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u53ef\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u4e3a\u52a0\u6027\u4f30\u503c\u53ca\u5176\u8d85\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u53ef\u5206\u914d\u6027\u3002\u52a0\u6027\u4f30\u503c\u5728\u7ebf\u6700\u4f4e\u8865\u8d34\u53ef\u8fbe\u03a9(mn)\uff0c\u800c\u7ebf\u4e0b\u4e3aO(n)\uff0c\u8fd8\u627e\u51fa\u6700\u4f4e\u8865\u8d34\u5c0f\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u7c7b\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u8865\u8d34\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u7269\u54c1\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u7ef4\u62a4\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8865\u8d34\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002"}}

With the help of LLM inference frameworks, such as\nllama.cpp, which support optimizations such as KV-caching and quantization, it\nis now easier than ever to deploy LLMs on edge devices. Quantization is\nfundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp\nutilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit\nwidth of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational\npower required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP\nquantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due\nto quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of\nBFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP\nvariants without reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible\nBlock FloatingPoint Quantization (F-BFQ) accelerator, which can dynamically\nswitch between two BFP quantization variants and perform matrix multiplication\n(MatMul) operations.

Recent\nworks have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the\nspectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their\ndensity estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can\naccurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the\ndiffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in\ncompute- and memory-constrained scenarios.\n  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,\nmotivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.\nMoreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also\napproximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent\nLID estimator, FLIPD.

However, exact computation is\nintractable for systems with more than $\\sim20$ agents due to exponential\ncomplexity $\\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide\nstatistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot\ntransfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them\nimpractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel\nlearning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate\nBanzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a\ngraph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent\ninfluence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a\ncomprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN\narchitectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with\nEdge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of\n200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count\n(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained\nGNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with\norder-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most\nsignificantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on\ngraphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for\nentirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring\nretraining.

However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from\nrepeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical\npipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full\ncontext-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to\ninefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution\nfor avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes\nremain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to\ndiverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify\nthat the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents.\nTo address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables\nefficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning\ncache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM\nestimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of\ncached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under\nvarying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing\ndynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM\nachieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including\nretrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks,\nall without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent\nreceives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a\nfive-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard\nprefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u5904\u7406\u91cd\u53e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6KVCOMM\uff0c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u91cd\u7528\u7387\u548c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u91cd\u53e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u73b0\u6709KV\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6KVCOMM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u8003\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0d\u540c\u524d\u7f00\u4e0b\u7f13\u5b58\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u951a\u70b9\u6c60\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5bb9\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u4e14\u951a\u70b9\u6c60\u5728\u7ebf\u7ef4\u62a4\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "KVCOMM\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d8570%\u7684\u91cd\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u9884\u586b\u5145\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe7.8\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5c06TTFT\u4ece\u7ea6430\u6beb\u79d2\u964d\u81f3\u7ea655\u6beb\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "KVCOMM\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

There is a need to develop a model that accurately\nperceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to\ncontrol the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based\nanalytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the\ndriving environment.

The perception model is validated based on the object detection\ntask, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'\nperformance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show\nthree best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,\nSGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822).

However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial\nperturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate\nthe robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies\nfocus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider\nhow to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations\nsuch as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential\nsynergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack\n(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two\nimportant phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent\nmethod utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an\nadversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed\nstate, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final\nadversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the\ndistance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added\ninto the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.\nWe evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating\nthat (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only\nattacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its\nattacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSAJA\u6846\u67b6\u653b\u51fbMADRL\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728MPE\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u653b\u51fb\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "MADRL\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4ece\u653b\u51fb\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAJA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542b\u72b6\u6001\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u653b\u51fb\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u6b65\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6297\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728MPE\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSAJA\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u653b\u51fb\u4e14\u66f4\u9690\u853d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u62b5\u5fa1\u5176\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "SAJA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u653b\u51fbMADRL\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

It involves a cooperative game\nmodel where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the\ninput (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based\non these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically\nimpose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired\ngeneration.

We\nargue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,\nwhere latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This\ntension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:\nconstructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.\nRethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent\nmutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may\ncause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,\nexpressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such\ncollapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an\ninformation-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this\ntradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian\nformulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a\nstable and interpretable Koopman representation.

We show that under uniform weighting, the TE\nvanishes asymptotically with a $\\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas\ndiscounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount\nfactor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step.

Not only does it serve as a rigorous\ntheoretical benchmark for evaluating statistical methods, but it also sheds\nlight on how to develop and unify novel statistical procedures. For example,\nthe calculus of influence functions has led to many important statistical\nbreakthroughs in the past decades. Responding to the pressing challenge of\nanalyzing increasingly complex datasets, particularly those with\nnon-Euclidean/nonlinear structures, many novel statistical models and methods\nhave been proposed in recent years. However, the existing efficiency theory is\nnot always readily applicable to these cases, as the theory was developed, for\nthe most part, under the often neglected premise that both the sample space and\nthe parameter space are normed linear spaces. As a consequence, efficiency\nresults outside normed linear spaces are quite rare and isolated, obtained on a\ncase-by-case basis. This paper aims to develop a more unified asymptotic\nefficiency theory, allowing the sample space, the parameter space, or both to\nbe Riemannian manifolds satisfying certain regularity conditions. We build a\nvocabulary that helps translate essential concepts in efficiency theory from\nnormed linear spaces to Riemannian manifolds, such as (locally) regular\nestimators, differentiable functionals, etc. Efficiency bounds are established\nunder conditions parallel to those for normed linear spaces.

Recent\nadvances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this\nlatent structure.

We are now\naddressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages\nclustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed\neffectively speed up learning.\n  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first\nlearns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an\noptimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm\nachieves a regret that is $O(\\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible\nto clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the\ncardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\\cdot)$ holds\nup to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior\nbound, $O(\\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large.

Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static\nrepresentations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),\nare efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program\nwill behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic\nrepresentations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights\ninto performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks\ndue to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends\nthis trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program\nrepresentation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization\nsensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation\ngenerated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization\nsequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To\neffectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a\ncompositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize\nthe continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.\nSubsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to\nlearn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes.

Existing studies often pre-process raw training\ndatasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or\noff-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining\nwhether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data\nquality through individual influence on validation data using our newly\nproposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring\npresent in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is\ninherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits\none model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data\nselection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we\nintroduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally\nsimpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model\ndependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for\npreference data selection.

Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis\nis confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across\nrepresentative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on\nsummarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the\ncomplexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in\nspecific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative\nmodels, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative\nloads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can\napproximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour\nbetween substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network\noperation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more\npronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as\nestimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a\nConditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power\nprofiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed.

However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose\nlimited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents\nRockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that\nachieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault\nor malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that\nCPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that\nintegrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for\ndistributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need\nminimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and\nefficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes\nthe communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.\nHardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate\nRockNet's effectiveness.

Drawing on historical analogies, we emphasize that no past\ntransition constituted a strict singularity: disruptive shifts eventually\nbecame governable through new norms and institutions.\n  We examine recurring patterns across revolutions -- democratization at the\nusage layer, concentration at the production layer, falling costs, and\ndeepening personalization -- and show how these dynamics are intensifying in\nthe AI era. Sectoral analysis illustrates how accounting, law, education,\ntranslation, advertising, and software engineering are being reshaped as\nroutine cognition is commoditized and human value shifts to judgment, trust,\nand ethical responsibility. At the frontier, the challenge of designing moral\nAI agents highlights the need for robust guardrails, mechanisms for moral\ngeneralization, and governance of emergent multi-agent dynamics.\n  We conclude that AI is neither a singular break nor merely incremental\nprogress. It is both evolutionary and revolutionary: predictable in its median\neffects yet carrying singularity-class tail risks.

Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR\nbenchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real\nRGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion\nframework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural\nfidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal\nbaselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of\nU2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight\nsubstantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and\nautonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6076\u52a3\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4eceLWIR\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210SWIR\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u9762\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cSWIR\u6210\u50cf\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u4eceLWIR\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210SWIR\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u5408\u6210SWIR\u3001LWIR\u548cRGB\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668 - \u89e3\u7801\u5668\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

These models typically\nrely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture\nuser intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording\nnecessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,\nleading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this\nstorage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system\ndesigned to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded\nmobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We\nidentify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user\nbehavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across\ndifferent features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing\nbehaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To\nsolve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level\nredundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and\nproposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,\nAdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous\nbehaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to\nensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an\nincremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting\noutdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into\npopular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on\nreal-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%\nwith minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),\nproviding a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device\nML.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAdaLog\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3ML\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u65e5\u5fd7\u5b58\u50a8\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u65e5\u5fd7\u5927\u5c0f\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "ML\u9a71\u52a8\u670d\u52a1\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5e26\u6765\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u4f4e\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5378\u8f7d\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6d88\u9664\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u5197\u4f59\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8d85\u56fe\u6700\u5927\u52a0\u6743\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u865a\u62df\u54c8\u5e0c\u5c5e\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u914d\u5f02\u6784\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cAdaLog\u51cf\u5c11\u884c\u4e3a\u65e5\u5fd7\u5927\u5c0f19% - 44%\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u9500\u4ec52\u79d2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c15MB\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaLog\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5229\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefML\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To\nbridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating\nsequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully\ndesigned dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with\n2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.\nAdditionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic\nevaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and\ntemporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency.

Through\nsystematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current\nT2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action\nsequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and\ndifficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between\nsequential actions.

Furthermore, without\nlarge-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on\nlarge-scale robotic data, like $\\pi_0.5$-KI, $\\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct.\nThese findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms\nSmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data.

Most existing deep\nlearning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,\nneglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,\nwe propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP\nframework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture\ncomprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder\nbased on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable\nBERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared\nlatent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance\nefficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where\nthe trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student\nmodel to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT\ndatasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding\n97%.

To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,\nwe consider the $\\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline\nalgorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the\nmaximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the\n$K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time\nslots, and its {\\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its\n$\\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\\textit{min-max}$\nregret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret\nneeds to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.\n  We consider this $\\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where\nall loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the\ni.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known\n$\\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably\nsimple proof that its expected $\\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\\sqrt{T \\log\nK})$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u62d3\u5c55\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u81f3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8003\u8651min - max\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u5728i.i.d.\u8f93\u5165\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408Hedge\u548cOGD\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u671f\u671bmin - max\u9057\u61be\u4e3aO(\u221a(T log K))\u3002", "motivation": "\u62d3\u5bbd\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5728i.i.d.\u8f93\u5165\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u8457\u540d\u7684Hedge\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08OGD\uff09\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u671f\u671bmin - max\u9057\u61be\u4e3aO(\u221a(T log K))\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408Hedge\u548cOGD\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7684i.i.d.\u8f93\u5165\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236min - max\u9057\u61be\u3002"}}

An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a\nfaster alternative for climate downscaling.

This paper\nbenchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces\nphysics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,\nwith a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.\nOur experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models\nsuch as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,\ncentral Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,\nMorocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north.

Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate\nmodels can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.\nConversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and\nencompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity\ninformation, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in\npractical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of\ndifferent modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating\nthe modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive\nmulti-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse\ndata types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded\ninputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural\nnetworks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity\nlevels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded\ninputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection\nsystem enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while\nensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level\nwithout altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new\ninput data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions\nbased on the available inputs.

Recently, MARL\nmodels, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep\nQ-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging\nsequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance\nperformance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in\nwhich agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action\nDecisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which\nagents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence\nof action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and\npredict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a\nTransformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the\nsequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL\narchitecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next\nagent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss\nfunction to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential\ndecision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive\nexperiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo\nbenchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model\noutperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8003\u8651\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u987a\u5e8f\u7684AOAD - MAT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MARL\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAOAD - MAT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6f14\u5458 - \u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u884c\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728StarCraft Multi - Agent Challenge\u548cMulti - Agent MuJoCo\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAOAD - MAT\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709MAT\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c03\u6574AOAD\u987a\u5e8f\u5728MARL\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

In\nthis paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of\nadversarial attack on RL.

We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient\nagent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on\nstate-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms.

Manual investigation of such a vast\namount of malware is an unrealistic, time-consuming, and overwhelming task. To\ncope with this volume, there is a clear need to develop specialized techniques\nand efficient tools for preliminary filtering that can group malware based on\nsemantic similarity. In this paper, we propose TrapNet, a novel, scalable, and\nunsupervised framework for malware fingerprinting and grouping. TrapNet employs\ngraph community detection techniques for malware fingerprinting and family\nattribution based on static analysis, as follows: (1) TrapNet detects packed\nbinaries and unpacks them using known generic packer tools. (2) From each\nmalware sample, it generates a digest that captures the underlying semantics.\nSince the digest must be dense, efficient, and suitable for similarity\nchecking, we designed FloatHash (FH), a novel numerical fuzzy hashing technique\nthat produces a short real-valued vector summarizing the underlying assembly\nitems and their order. FH is based on applying Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) to ordered assembly items (e.g., opcodes, function calls) extracted from\nthe malware's assembly code. (3) Representing malware with short numerical\nvectors enables high-performance, large-scale similarity computation, which\nallows TrapNet to build a malware similarity network. (4) Finally, TrapNet\nemploys state-of-the-art community detection algorithms to identify dense\ncommunities, which represent groups of malware with similar semantics.

However, video MAR models\nsuffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack\nof a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation\nacross the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this\nwork, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues\nby introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next\nframe, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides\nglobal structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame\nsynthesis.

Despite this progress, their adversarial\nrobustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial\npatch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first\nintroduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic\nadversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the\ncamera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to\ndifferent VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model\narchitecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these\npatches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual\nlatent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent\nrepresentations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.\nThrough the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's\ninterpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate\nincorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given\nrobotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for\nthe visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent\nrepresentations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.\nExtensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation\nbenchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate\nof cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates\nthis degradation.

Its core idea is spatially guided\nvision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical\nlink between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage\npipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning\ndata to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,\nembodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training\nto decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through\nplug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields\nconsistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance\nby +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO\nFranka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,\npoint, and trace prediction.

In\nreal-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with\nsynthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel\nconfigurations.

However, domain shift remains a key concern for clinical adoption: priors\ntrained on images from one anatomy, acquisition protocol or pathology may\nproduce artefacts on out-of-distribution data. We propose integrating steerable\nconditional diffusion (SCD) with our previously-introduced likelihood-scheduled\ndiffusion (PET-LiSch) framework to improve the alignment of the diffusion\nmodel's prior to the target subject. At reconstruction time, for each diffusion\nstep, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align the diffusion model prior with\nthe target domain on the fly. Experiments on realistic synthetic 2D brain\nphantoms demonstrate that our approach suppresses hallucinated artefacts under\ndomain shift, i.e. when our diffusion model is trained on perturbed images and\ntested on normal anatomy, our approach suppresses the hallucinated structure,\noutperforming both OSEM and diffusion model baselines qualitatively and\nquantitatively. These results provide a proof-of-concept that steerable priors\ncan mitigate domain shift in diffusion-based PET reconstruction and motivate\nfuture evaluation on real data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210SCD\u4e0ePET - LiSch\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528LoRA\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684PET\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8ePET\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u5b58\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53ef\u8f6c\u5411\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\uff08SCD\uff09\u4e0e\u4f3c\u7136\u8c03\u5ea6\u6269\u6563\uff08PET - LiSch\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u65f6\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5408\u62102D\u8111\u6a21\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eOSEM\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u8f6c\u5411\u5148\u9a8c\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684PET\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

The investigation is conducted\nthrough four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several\nanalyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral\nanalysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis\nwith PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual\ninformation are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a\n2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to\nperforming spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning\na spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,\nPLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean\ncontent of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.\nModeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is\nlimited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.\nTherefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat\ncontent in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and\npixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN\naugmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with\nPLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by\nanalyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results\nwere inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,\nthis thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages.

We first distinguish attention heads\nbetween locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that\nlocally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating\nphrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad\ndownstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:\n1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward\nattention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which\nquantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives\nfrom subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring\npreplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range\ncontextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately\nfollowed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent\nreasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies\nthat dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan\ntokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent\nperformance gains across various reasoning tasks.

This generalizes the familiar problem of Gaussian\ncovariance estimation, for which the sample covariance achieves optimal\nestimation error. For Elliptical distributions, Tyler proposed a natural\nM-estimator and showed strong statistical properties in the asymptotic regime,\nindependent of the underlying distribution. Numerical experiments show that\nthis estimator performs very well, and that Tyler's iterative procedure\nconverges quickly to the estimator. Franks and Moitra recently provided the\nfirst distribution-free error bounds in the finite sample setting, as well as\nthe first rigorous convergence analysis of Tyler's iterative procedure.\nHowever, their results exceed the sample complexity of the Gaussian setting by\na $\\log^{2} d$ factor. We close this gap by proving optimal sample threshold\nand error bounds for Tyler's M-estimator for all Elliptical distributions,\nfully matching the Gaussian result.

This\nchallenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private\nand may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party\nverification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later\nverification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and\nrely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and\nnon-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight\nwatermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the\ndiffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation\nprocess. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is\nhighly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash\nfunction into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a\nvalid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an\nalternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the\nrobustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to\nuse cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing\nthe seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark\nremoval. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating\nefficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access\nto model weights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7248\u6743\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848NoisePrints\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u53ca\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u7248\u6743\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u8457\u4f5c\u6743\u6210\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7248\u6743\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4e0d\u66b4\u9732\u79cd\u5b50\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u6709\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1NoisePrints\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u79cd\u5b50\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u5c31\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848NoisePrints\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u5bc6\u79cd\u5b50\u589e\u52a0\u6c34\u5370\u53bb\u9664\u96be\u5ea6\u3002"}}
