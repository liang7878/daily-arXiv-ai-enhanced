Traditional software-based schedulers struggle to efficiently balance\nworkload distribution due to high scheduling overhead, lack of adaptability to\ndynamic workloads, and suboptimal resource utilization. These pitfalls are\ncompounded in heterogeneous systems, where differing computational elements can\nhave vastly different performance profiles.

By\nintroducing a hardware-accelerated approach to real-time scheduling, this paper\nestablishes a new paradigm for adaptive scheduling mechanisms in heterogeneous\ncomputing systems.

Quantization has emerged as a promising solution; however, its\neffectiveness is often limited by quantization errors arising from weight\ndistributions that are not quantization-friendly and the presence of activation\noutliers. To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative\npost-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight\ncompression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance\ndegradation. DBellQuant uses Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB)\nalgorithm, which transforms single-bell weight distributions into dual-bell\nforms to reduce binarization errors and applies inverse transformations to\nsmooth activations. DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving\nsuperior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization.\nFor example, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant achieves a perplexity of\n14.39 on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, significantly\noutperforming BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization, underscoring its\npotential in compressing LLMs for real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDBellQuant\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DBellQuant\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Learnable Transformation for Dual - Bell (LTDB)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u949f\u5f62\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u4e3a\u53cc\u949f\u5f62\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u9006\u53d8\u6362\u5e73\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Wikitext2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cLLaMA2 - 13B 6\u4f4d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u91cf\u5316\u65f6\uff0cDBellQuant\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea614.39\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85BiLLM\u65e0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u91cf\u5316\u768421.35\u3002", "conclusion": "DBellQuant\u5728\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u6f5c\u529b\u5927\u3002"}}

Existing solutions either rely\non heuristic rules or historical templates, often failing to effectively\nutilize contextual information, despite studies showing that over half of\nadaptation cases are context-dependent. In this paper, we introduce WIRL, an\nLLM-based agent for code wiring framed as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) infilling task. WIRL combines an LLM, a customized toolkit, and an\norchestration module to identify unresolved variables, retrieve context, and\nperform context-aware substitutions.

We evaluate WIRL on a carefully curated, high-quality dataset\nconsisting of real-world code adaptation scenarios.

Within this framework, we show that\nbinarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking\nrecovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking\nerror associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential\nconvergence rate than that of ordinal data.

Because most of the global\nminima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly\nPlatonic solution is rather extraordinary.

Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a\nrapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable\nperformance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt\ntrial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1)\ninherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low\nsearch efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose\nAPRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS\nincorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing\na global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising\none for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the\nproblems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of\npatch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that,\nwhen integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which\noutperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini,\nGPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs,\nrespectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance\nadvantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the\n500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared\nto existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and\nmonetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively.

To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness.

When\nevaluating recommender systems, most studies focus on overall recommendation\nperformance. Only a few assess the quality of the explanations.

We\naim to fill this gap by developing an objective metric to evaluate Veracity:\nthe information quality of explanations. Specifically, we decompose Veracity\ninto two dimensions: Fidelity and Attunement. Fidelity refers to whether the\nexplanation includes accurate information about the recommended item.\nAttunement evaluates whether the explanation reflects the target user's\npreferences. By applying signal detection theory, we first determine decision\noutcomes for each dimension and then combine them to calculate a sensitivity,\nwhich serves as the final Veracity value.

In this work, we identify and exploit\na critical observation: within these solvers, a large portion of the solution\nremains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant\ncomputations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address\nthis, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA)\ndecomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA\npreserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within\neach segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable\nportions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be\naggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg),\na novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and\nunstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants:\nnon-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate),\nautoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy,\nwith bespoke training and inference strategies. Empirical results on CVRP and\nVRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up\nto 7x.

We focus on the Gaussian case as a motivating paradigm, and\nprovide a reduction of this more general optimal transport criterion to a\nmatrix optimization problem. This reduction enables us to provide a complete\ndescription of the solution, both in terms of the primal variable and the dual\nvariables. We argue that flexibility in terms of the reference measure can be\nimportant in statistical contexts, for instance when one has prior information,\nwhen there is uncertainty regarding the measures to be coupled, or to reduce\nbias when the entropic problem is used to estimate the un-regularized transport\nproblem.

Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples.

In this\npaper, we critically re-examine this popular family of OOD detection\nprocedures, and we argue that these methods are fundamentally answering the\nwrong questions for OOD detection. There is no simple fix to this misalignment,\nsince a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected\nto identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently\nmisclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from\ndogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike.

Here, we aim to solve these gaps by proposing a variational\ndigital twin (VDT) framework that augments standard neural architectures with a\nsingle Bayesian output layer. This lightweight addition, along with a novel VDT\nupdating algorithm, lets a twin update in seconds on commodity GPUs while\nproducing calibrated uncertainty bounds that can inform experiment design,\ncontrol algorithms, and model reliability. The VDT is evaluated on four\nenergy-sector problems. For critical-heat-flux prediction, uncertainty-driven\nactive learning reaches R2 = 0.98 using 47 % fewer experiments and one-third\nthe training time of random sampling. A three-year renewable-generation twin\nmaintains R2 > 0.95 for solar output and curbs error growth for volatile wind\nforecasts via monthly updates that process only one month of data at a time. A\nnuclear reactor transient cooldown twin reconstructs thermocouple signals with\nR2 > 0.99 and preserves accuracy after 50 % sensor loss, demonstrating\nrobustness to degraded instrumentation. Finally, a physics-informed Li-ion\nbattery twin, retrained after every ten discharges, lowers voltage mean-squared\nerror by an order of magnitude relative to the best static model while adapting\nits credible intervals as the cell approaches end-of-life.

This study compares the performance of three AI\nmodels [Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), and\nJoint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)] in predicting triage outcomes\nagainst the FRENCH scale and clinical practice.We conducted a retrospective\nanalysis of a prospectively recruited cohort gathering adult patient triage\ndata over a 7-month period at the Roger Salengro Hospital ED (Lille, France).\nThree AI models were trained and validated : (1) TRIAGEMASTER (NLP), (2)\nURGENTIAPARSE (LLM), and (3) EMERGINET (JEPA). Data included demographic\ndetails, verbatim chief complaints, vital signs, and triage outcomes based on\nthe FRENCH scale and GEMSA coding. The primary outcome was the concordance of\nAI-predicted triage level with the FRENCH gold-standard. It was assessed thanks\nto various indicators : F1-Score, Weighted Kappa, Spearman, MAE, RMSE. The LLM\nmodel (URGENTIAPARSE) showed higher accuracy (composite score: 2.514) compared\nto JEPA (EMERGINET, 0.438) and NLP (TRIAGEMASTER, -3.511), outperforming nurse\ntriage (-4.343).

Synthesis of emerging patterns from the literature was achieved by\nthematic categorization. Six of these had enough quantitative information,\ni.e., item-level means and standard deviations, to permit probabilistic\nmodeling. One dataset, from the resulting subset, was itself selected as a\nrepresentative case with which to illustrate inverse-variance weighting by\nMonte Carlo simulation, by virtue of its well-designed Likert scale format and\nthematic alignment with the use of computing systems by the researcher.\n  The simulation provided a composite \"Success Score\" forecasting the strength\nof the relationship between student perceptions and learning achievements.\nFindings reveal that attitude factors concerned with usability and real-world\nusefulness are significantly better predictors of positive learning achievement\nthan affective or trust-based factors. Such an interdisciplinary perspective\nprovides a unique means of linking thematic results with predictive modelling,\nresonating with longstanding controversies about the proper use of GenAI tools\nwithin the university.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u8ba8\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6001\u5ea6\u56e0\u7d20\u6bd4\u60c5\u611f\u6216\u4fe1\u4efb\u56e0\u7d20\u66f4\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u60f3\u4e86\u89e3\u5b66\u751f\u770b\u6cd5\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4eceScopus\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u9009\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u884c\u9006\u65b9\u5dee\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5f97\u51fa\u201c\u6210\u529f\u5206\u6570\u201d\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6001\u5ea6\u56e0\u7d20\u6bd4\u60c5\u611f\u6216\u4fe1\u4efb\u56e0\u7d20\u66f4\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u79ef\u6781\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u89c6\u89d2\u5c06\u4e3b\u9898\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u547c\u5e94\u5927\u5b66\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u3002"}}

We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this\ntoy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from\nrandomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the\ntransformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its\ncontext when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking\na closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two\nfunctions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that\nsystem to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system\nto predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first\ncapability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second\ncapability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much\nearlier.\n  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model\nweights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy\nproblem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the\ndiscrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the\nstart of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,\nwhich is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a\n\"Bayesian-style\" prediction based on the previous token and the context.

The system autonomously conducts cell passaging and culture\ntasks, matching or exceeding manual performance in viability, consistency, and\nmorphological integrity. It also supports context-aware optimization,\noutperforming conventional strategies in differentiating retinal pigment\nepithelial cells. A web interface enables real-time human-AI collaboration,\nwhile a modular backend allows scalable integration with laboratory hardware.\nThese results highlight the feasibility of generalizable, AI-driven laboratory\nautomation and the transformative role of language-based reasoning in\nbiological research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u667a\u80fd\u5e73\u53f0BioMARS\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b8c\u6210\u751f\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u51f8\u663eAI\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u521a\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7b49\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "BioMARS\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6\u4ee3\u7406\u5408\u6210\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u5458\u4ee3\u7406\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f2a\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u68c0\u67e5\u5458\u4ee3\u7406\u786e\u4fdd\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b8c\u6210\u7ec6\u80de\u4f20\u4ee3\u548c\u57f9\u517b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u624b\u52a8\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u8272\u7d20\u4e0a\u76ae\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u7684\u3001AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u751f\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

One of the primary challenges in addressing\nthese issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this\nproblem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods\nto automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection\nalgorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this\nstudy, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on\nthese approaches.

This paper addresses the challenge of generating\nclassical piano performances from scratch, aiming to emulate the dual roles of\ncomposer and pianist in the creative process. We introduce the Expressive\nCompound Word (ECP) representation, which effectively captures both the\nmetrical structure and expressive nuances of classical performances. Building\non this, we propose the Expressive Music Variational AutoEncoder (XMVAE), a\nmodel featuring two branches: a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder\n(VQ-VAE) branch that generates score-related content, representing the\nComposer, and a vanilla VAE branch that produces expressive details, fulfilling\nthe role of Pianist.

In contrast to\nprior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)\napproximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information\nto capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian\nmatrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned\nwhen the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a\nmore reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate\nthe rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a\nquadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in\ngeneral. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular\nfunction maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with\napproximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under\nwhich the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a\nclosed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid\ntheoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational\nefficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,\nalternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank\nbudget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach.

Addressing\nthese challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal\nInteraction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a\npromising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual\ndescriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual\ninputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive\ncross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into\nthe image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.\nTo eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting\nstrategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of\nchallenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy\nfor memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical\nimaging and enhance localized details.

Previous work on large-scale\nNeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces\nSnake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method\neliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and\noperates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest\ninto NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with\noverlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We\nintroduce a novel $2\\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented\nsampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.\nOur experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be\nprocessed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise\nin quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSnake - NeRF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf3D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5355\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NeRF\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c0f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSnake - NeRF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u65e0\u91cd\u53e0\u76843D NeRF\u5757\uff0c\u88c1\u526a\u56fe\u50cf\u6709\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5f15\u51652\u00d72 3D\u5757\u63a8\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5206\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u5728\u5355GPU\u4e0a\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5927\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Snake - NeRF\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

These demands\nchallenge traditional code-specific decoders, which lack the flexibility and\nscalability required for next-generation systems. To tackle this problem, we\npropose an AI-native foundation model for unified and code-agnostic decoding\nbased on the transformer architecture. We first introduce a cross-attention\nmessage-passing transformer (CrossMPT). CrossMPT employs two masked\ncross-attention blocks that iteratively update two distinct input\nrepresentations-magnitude and syndrome vectors-allowing the model to\neffectively learn the decoding problem. Notably, our CrossMPT has achieved\nstate-of-the-art decoding performance among single neural decoders. Building on\nthis, we develop foundation CrossMPT (FCrossMPT) by making the architecture\ninvariant to code length, rate, and class, allowing a single trained model to\ndecode a broad range of codes without retraining.

However, directly training policies to\nsimultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due\nto unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address\nthis, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving\npriors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple\nstages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors\nthrough iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER\nprogressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration\nand policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or\nhandcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured\nthree-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation\nspace, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust\nmonopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the\nresulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional\nmethods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly\nspaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm.\nJumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing\nlocomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faJumpER\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u5f62\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u6311\u6218\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJumpER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9012\u589e\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f15\u5bfc\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u5f62\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u5e94\u5bf9\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "JumpER\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u539f\u5219\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However,\ntraditional methods rely on subjective human judgment, which requires\nconsiderable time and effort. To address this issue, we developed a deep\nlearning model using a transformer encoder for a more objective and efficient\nclassification. Tested on Mount Asama's diverse seismic activity, our model\nachieved high F1 scores (0.930 for volcano tectonic, 0.931 for low-frequency\nearthquakes, and 0.980 for noise), superior to a conventional CNN-based method.\nTo enhance interpretability, attention weight visualizations were analyzed,\nrevealing that the model focuses on key waveform features similarly to human\nexperts. However, inconsistencies in training data, such as ambiguously labeled\nB-type events with S-waves, were found to influence classification accuracy and\nattention weight distributions. Experiments addressing data selection and\naugmentation demonstrated the importance of balancing data quality and\ndiversity. In addition, stations within 3 km of the crater played an important\nrole in improving model performance and interpretability.

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is\ntime-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising\npass using a LoRA swapping technique.

This\npaper introduces a privacy-preserving platform by which manufacturers may\nsafely share their data with researchers through secure methods, so that those\nresearchers then create innovative tools to solve the manufacturers' real-world\nproblems, and then provide tools that execute solutions back onto the platform\nfor others to use with privacy and confidentiality guarantees. We illustrate\nthis problem through a particular use case which addresses an important problem\nin the large-scale manufacturing of food crystals, which is that quality\ncontrol relies on image analysis tools. Previous to our research, food crystals\nin the images were manually counted, which required substantial and\ntime-consuming human efforts, but we have developed and deployed a crystal\nanalysis tool which makes this process both more rapid and accurate.

To explore their true detection\npotential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).\nOur results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both\nacceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally\nefficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the\nother more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than\noriginal Mag1c on resource-limited hardware.

We analyze\nthe CAMS Meteoroid Orbit Database v3.0 using three feature vectors: LUTAB (CAMS\ngeocentric parameters), ORBIT (heliocentric orbital elements), and GEO (adapted\ngeocentric parameters). HDBSCAN is applied with varying minimum cluster sizes\nand two cluster selection methods (eom and leaf). To align HDBSCAN clusters\nwith CAMS classifications, the Hungarian algorithm determines the optimal\nmapping. Clustering performance is assessed via the Silhouette score,\nNormalized Mutual Information, and F1 score, with Principal Component Analysis\nfurther supporting the analysis. With the GEO vector, HDBSCAN confirms 39\nmeteoroid streams, 21 strongly aligning with CAMS. The ORBIT vector identifies\n30 streams, 13 with high matching scores. Less active showers pose\nidentification challenges. The eom method consistently yields superior\nperformance and agreement with CAMS. Although HDBSCAN requires careful\nselection of the minimum cluster size, it delivers robust, internally\nconsistent clusters and outperforms the look-up table method in statistical\ncoherence.

Stellar\nspectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical\ninformation about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral\ndatasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support\ndiverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves\npre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed\nby contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different\ninstruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve\nspectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between\nspectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information\nbetween embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework\nenabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments.

We address these\nchallenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable\nand API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized\nbenchmarking framework.\n  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art\nspecialist models at any task.

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required.

LCS programs herald a\ngenerational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related\nearly-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of\nradiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a\ncomputationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT\nanalysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can\nbe fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with\nlimited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained\nfrom scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning,\nthereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label\nefficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of\nfine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000\nthoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public\ndatasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease\nclassification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases,\nwhile generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a\nmasked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable\nsolution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive\nmodels by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest\ncomputational requirements.

A common approach to understanding these systems is to\nmodel the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between\nthem. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the\nsubsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the\ndirectionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between\nsubsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically\nlinear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by\nnonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven\nnonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions\nvia the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning\nJacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning\nmethod that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for\narbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs\noutperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems,\nincluding high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we\nshow that the \"sensory\" area gains greater control over the \"cognitive\" area\nover learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the\ntrained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior.
