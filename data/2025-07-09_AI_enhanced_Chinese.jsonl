However, optimizing purely for revenue can lead to imbalanced\nsales across products, potentially causing supplier disengagement and reduced\nproduct diversity. To address these fairness concerns, we introduce a market\nshare balancing constraint that limits the disparity in expected sales between\nany two offered products to a factor of a given parameter $\\alpha$. We study\nboth static and dynamic assortment optimization under the multinomial logit\n(MNL) model with this fairness constraint. In the static setting, the seller\nselects a distribution over assortments that satisfies the market share\nbalancing constraint while maximizing expected revenue. We show that this\nproblem can be solved in polynomial time, and we characterize the structure of\nthe optimal solution: a product is included if and only if its revenue and\npreference weight exceed certain thresholds. We further extend our analysis to\nsettings with additional feasibility constraints on the assortment and\ndemonstrate that, given a $\\beta$-approximation oracle for the constrained\nproblem, we can construct a $\\beta$-approximation algorithm under the fairness\nconstraint. In the dynamic setting, each product has a finite initial\ninventory, and the seller implements a dynamic policy to maximize total\nexpected revenue while respecting both inventory limits and the market share\nbalancing constraint in expectation. We design a policy that is asymptotically\noptimal, with its approximation ratio converging to one as inventories grow\nlarge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ebf\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u4f18\u5316\u5546\u54c1\u7ec4\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5e02\u573a\u4efd\u989d\u5e73\u8861\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5546\u54c1\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u7eaf\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u5165\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea7\u54c1\u9500\u552e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u4e0d\u6ee1\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u9879logit\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5f15\u5165\u5e02\u573a\u4efd\u989d\u5e73\u8861\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u9759\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u52a8\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u4efd\u989d\u5e73\u8861\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5546\u54c1\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Their performance is typically evaluated using programming\nbenchmarks that simulate real-world tasks. These benchmarks provide\nspecifications in the form of docstrings, function signatures, or bug reports.\nThe model then generates a program, which is tested against predefined test\ncases. In contrast, Programming by Example (PBE) uses input-output examples as\nthe specification. Traditional PBE systems rely on search-based methods over\nrestricted transformation spaces. They are usually designed for narrow domains\nand fixed input formats. It remains unclear how well LLMs perform on PBE tasks.\n  In this work, we evaluate LLMs on PBE tasks involving tabular data\ntransformations. We prompt models to generate functions that convert an input\ntable to an output table. We test the generated functions on unseen inputs to\nmeasure accuracy. Our study includes multiple LLMs and evaluates different\nprompting strategies, such as one-shot vs. multi-try. We also compare\nperformance with and without PBE-specific knowledge.

Working paper (1st full draft); typos may exist", "summary": "In the online portfolio optimization framework, existing learning algorithms\ngenerate strategies that yield significantly poorer cumulative wealth compared\nto the best constant rebalancing portfolio in hindsight, despite being\nconsistent in asymptotic growth rate. While this unappealing performance can be\nimproved by incorporating more side information, it raises difficulties in\nfeature selection and high-dimensional settings. Instead, the inherent serial\ndependence of assets' returns, such as day-of-the-week and other calendar\neffects, can be leveraged. Although latent serial dependence patterns are\ncommonly detected using large training datasets, this paper proposes an\nalgorithm that learns such dependence using only gradually revealed data,\nwithout any assumption on their distribution, to form a strategy that\neventually exceeds the cumulative wealth of the best constant rebalancing\nportfolio.\n  Moreover, the classical Kelly criterion, which requires independent assets'\nreturns, is generalized to accommodate serial dependence in a market modeled as\nan independent and identically distributed process of random matrices.

The value of the function is $1$ iff there are at least $k$ $1$s among\nthe variables. The goal is to efficiently compute a strategy that, at minimum\nexpected cost, tests the variables until the function value is determined.\nWhile an elegant polynomial-time exact algorithm is known when tests can be\nmade adaptively, we focus on the non-adaptive variant, for which much less is\nknown.\n  First, we show a clean and tight lower bound of $2$ on the adaptivity gap,\ni.e., the worst-case multiplicative loss in the objective function caused by\ndisallowing adaptivity, of the problem. This improves the tight lower bound of\n$3/2$ for the unit-cost variant.\n  Second, we give a PTAS for computing the best non-adaptive strategy in the\nunit-cost case, the first PTAS for an SBFE problem.

When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans\nare utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading\nto further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a\nuser-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study\nproposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous\ndescriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)\nresults, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or\nring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)\nsoftware and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first\nleverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan\ndescriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and\nphase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python\nscripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic\nsignal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.\nWithin a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan\nediting. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of\nover 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300\nplan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of\nunderstanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an\neasy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,\nserving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile\napplication of LLMs in the field of ITS.

Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a promising technique to\nachieve efficient utilization of communication resource for model aggregation\nby leveraging the superposition property of a wireless multiple access channel\n(MAC). However, AirComp requires strict synchronization among edge devices,\nwhich is hard to achieve in heterogeneous scenarios. In this paper, we propose\nan AirComp-based grouping asynchronous federated learning mechanism\n(Air-FedGA), which combines the advantages of AirComp and asynchronous FL to\naddress the communication and heterogeneity challenges. Specifically, Air-FedGA\norganizes workers into groups and performs over-the-air aggregation within each\ngroup, while groups asynchronously communicate with the parameter server to\nupdate the global model. In this way, Air-FedGA accelerates the FL model\ntraining by over-the-air aggregation, while relaxing the synchronization\nrequirement of this aggregation technology. We theoretically prove the\nconvergence of Air-FedGA. We formulate a training time minimization problem for\nAir-FedGA and propose the power control and worker grouping algorithm to solve\nit, which jointly optimizes the power scaling factors at edge devices, the\ndenoising factors at the parameter server, as well as the worker grouping\nstrategy.

Across these\ndata sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage\ncounterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the\nflow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of\n81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative\nerrors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial\ndetails. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware\nprior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual\nlearning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy,\nand (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow\nto nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural\nmodifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear,\ntime-dependent continua.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4f5c\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u65f6\u7a7a\u573a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u65f6\u7a7a\u573a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b97\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u7565\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u5176\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6b8b\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Recently, explainable artificial\nintelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of\nunderstanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be utilized to get to know the\ninner functioning of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and\nfeatures in the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN\ncompression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model\nsize with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance\nscore of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI\ntechnique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are\nused to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or\nzero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2)\nmixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with\nhigher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits.

However, because of the\nintricacy in the interplay between complex fluid flows and nonlinear structural\ndeformations that accompany the phenomenology of slamming, a general\nengineering theory in slamming has yet to be uncovered, and so design relies on\nspecialized theories. In this paper, we propose one such theory for a design\ncase that has, until now, eluded a proper description. In pursuit of this\ntheory, we employ a specialized implicit, partitioned fluid-structural\ninteraction (FSI) simulation approach, in order to study the underlying\nphysical mechanisms accompanying the oblique impact of a flexible plate during\nwater entry. In the present work, we first present validation results from\nflexible plate water entry experiments, to confirm the veracity of the\ndeveloped FSI solver. Subsequent to validation, we carry out a series of\nnumerical analyses, in an effort to characterize the regimes in impact force\nand plate out-of-plane deformations, as a function of impact velocities and\nplate flexural rigidity. Finally, we use our FSI solver, as a kind of\n\"microscope\", to study the mechanistic evolution of fluid flows and elastic\nplate deformations that occur during slamming.

In\na spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data\nby computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However,\nidentifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables\nremains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the\nproblem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot\ntables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of\nrecommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works\ninadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to\nconsider the problem of pivot table diversification.\n  We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted\ndiverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k\nrecommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is\ninsightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences,\nwhile also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each\nother, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical\ncontributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a\nsingle pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a\nscalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot\ntables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce\nthe combinatorial search space. Our extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently\nscales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets.

We conducted a quasi-experiment study to\nmeasure the effects of code changes on Large Language Model (LLM)s\ninterpretation regarding its readability quality attribute. Nine LLMs were\ntested, undergoing three interventions: removing comments, replacing identifier\nnames with obscure names, and refactoring to remove code smells. Each\nintervention involved 10 batch analyses per LLM, collecting data on response\nvariability. We compared the results with a known reference model and tool. The\nresults showed that all LLMs were sensitive to the interventions, with\nagreement with the reference classifier being high for the original and\nrefactored code scenarios. The LLMs demonstrated a strong semantic sensitivity\nthat the reference model did not fully capture. A thematic analysis of the LLMs\nreasoning confirmed their evaluations directly reflected the nature of each\nintervention. The models also exhibited response variability, with 9.37% to\n14.58% of executions showing a standard deviation greater than zero, indicating\nresponse oscillation, though this did not always compromise the statistical\nsignificance of the results.

Therefore, this paper systematically deconstruct the pros and\ncons of ID features: (i) they provide initial embedding but lack semantic\nrichness, (ii) they provide a unique identifier for each user and item but\nhinder generalization to untrained data, and (iii) they assist in aligning and\nfusing multimodal features but may lead to representation shift. Based on these\ninsights, this paper proposes IDFREE, an ID-free multimodal collaborative\nFiltering REcommEndation baseline. IDFREE replaces ID features with multimodal\nfeatures and positional encodings to generate semantically meaningful ID-free\nembeddings. For ID-free multimodal collaborative filtering, it further proposes\nan adaptive similarity graph module to construct dynamic user-user and\nitem-item graphs based on multimodal features. Then, an augmented user-item\ngraph encoder is proposed to construct more effective user and item encoding.\nFinally, IDFREE achieves inter-multimodal alignment based on the contrastive\nlearning and uses Softmax loss as recommendation loss. Basic experiments on\nthree public datasets demonstrate that IDFREE outperforms existing ID-based\nMCFRec methods, achieving an average performance gain of 72.24% across standard\nmetrics (Recall@5, 10, 20, 50 and NDCG@5, 10, 20, 50).

To address this gap, we introduce a novel\nChinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records\nannotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the\npredictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk\nstratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation\nframework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme\nassesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and\nICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.\nCrucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate\nhow different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP\nand its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield\ntwo principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP\nrisk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit\nmarked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.\nSecond, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent\ninclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared\nto negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating\npredictive bias in model outputs.

However, the use of LLMs for\nrecommendation tasks is limited by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.\nThis lack of relevant relational knowledge about the items to be recommended in\nthe LLM's pre-training corpus can lead to inaccuracies or hallucinations,\nresulting in incorrect or misleading recommendations. Moreover, directly using\ninformation from the knowledge graph introduces redundant and noisy\ninformation, which can affect the LLM's reasoning process or exceed its input\ncontext length, thereby reducing the performance of LLM-based recommendations.\nTo address the lack of domain-specific knowledge, we propose a novel model\ncalled Knowledge-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Recommendation\n(KERAG_R).

As physics-motivated applications, we use\nevortran to confront extended Higgs sectors with LHC data and to reconstruct\ngravitational wave spectra and the underlying physical parameters from LISA\nmock data, demonstrating its effectiveness in realistic, data-driven scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u7684Fortran\u5e93evortran\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u5e93\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e93\u6784\u5efa\u4e3afpm\u5305\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u793a\u4f8b\u57fa\u51c6\u5e94\u7528\u5c55\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "evortran\u5177\u6709\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u7b80\u5355\u5b89\u88c5\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7269\u7406\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "evortran\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u662f\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While existing research has primarily\nconcentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter\nregularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT\nremains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two\ncore post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge\nretention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT\ninherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to\nmulti-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit\nregularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.\nFinally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the\nstability and efficiency of RFT.

To support the\nidentification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have\nbeen developed.

Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement\nelicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks.

To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel approach combining profile generation via\nhierarchical interaction summarization (PGHIS), which leverages a pretrained\nLLM to hierarchically summarize user-item interactions, generating structured\ntextual profiles as explicit representations of user and item characteristics.\nAdditionally, we propose contrastive prompting for explanation generation\n(CPEG) which employs contrastive learning to guide another reasoning language\nmodels in producing high-quality ground truth recommendation explanations.\nFinally, we use the textual profiles of user and item as input and high-quality\nexplanation as output to fine-tune a LLM for generating explanations.\nExperimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a great improvement on\nmetrics about explainability (e.g., 5% on GPTScore) and text quality.\nFurthermore, our generated ground truth explanations achieve a significantly\nhigher win rate compared to user-written reviews and those produced by other\nmethods, demonstrating the effectiveness of CPEG in generating high-quality\nground truths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPGHIS\u548cCPEG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u8005\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPGHIS\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCPEG\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a8\u8350\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7528\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, given the expensive measurements, large configuration\nspace, and rugged configuration landscape, existing tuners suffer\nineffectiveness due to the difficult balance of budget utilization between\nexploring uncertain regions (for escaping from local optima) and exploiting\nguidance of known good configurations (for fast convergence). The root cause is\nthat we lack knowledge of where the promising regions lay, which also causes\nchallenges in the explainability of the results.\n  In this paper, we propose PromiseTune that tunes configuration guided by\ncausally purified rules. PromiseTune is unique in the sense that we learn\nrules, which reflect certain regions in the configuration landscape, and purify\nthem with causal inference. The remaining rules serve as approximated\nreflections of the promising regions, bounding the tuning to emphasize these\nplaces in the landscape. This, as we demonstrate, can effectively mitigate the\nimpact of the exploration and exploitation trade-off. Those purified regions\ncan then be paired with the measured configurations to provide spatial\nexplainability at the landscape level.

To incorporate user\nhistory for personalization, existing methods typically adopt a conditional\ndiffusion framework, where the reverse denoising process of reconstructing\nitems from noise is modified to be conditioned on the user history. However,\nthis design may fail to fully utilize historical information, as it gets\ndistracted by the need to model the \"item $\\leftrightarrow$ noise\" translation.\nThis motivates us to reformulate the diffusion process for sequential\nrecommendation in an unconditional manner, treating user history (instead of\nnoise) as the endpoint of the forward diffusion process (i.e., the starting\npoint of the reverse process), rather than as a conditional input. This\nformulation allows for exclusive focus on modeling the \"item $\\leftrightarrow$\nhistory\" translation. To this end, we introduce Brownian Bridge Diffusion\nRecommendation (BBDRec).

This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of\nreward hacking across diverse RL environments and algorithms. We analyze 15,247\ntraining episodes across 15 RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, custom domains) and\n5 algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, A3C, Rainbow), implementing automated detection\nalgorithms for six categories of reward hacking: specification gaming, reward\ntampering, proxy optimization, objective misalignment, exploitation patterns,\nand wireheading. Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7%\nrecall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through\ncontrolled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that\nreward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking\nfrequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$).

This study\ncompares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a\nreasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.\n  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI\n(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The\nanonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human\nexperts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical\nrubric.\n  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored\npeer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;\np=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th\n(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI\nplans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313).

After each\naction, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.\nHowever, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning\n(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is\nnon-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in\ncomplex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual\ntargets.\n  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI\nTest-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate\naction proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we\nsample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to\nevaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better\ndecision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and\nimproving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves\nimproved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its\ncorresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning\n(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,\nrewarding successful clicks on interface elements.\n  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across\ndiverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%\naccuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively.

A plethora of hardware accelerators has been\nintroduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.\nHowever, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally\noverlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to\nhardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output\nby modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory\ndevice. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware\nbit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight\ngradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of\nbits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is\ncreated to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted\nfrom memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a\nspecific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the\nselected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node\nclassification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that\nGBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its\nimpact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a\nlayer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's\nprediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in\nthe last layer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76GNN\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGBFA\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6b65\u64cd\u4f5c\u653b\u51fb\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u8106\u5f31\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGBFA\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u6ee1\u8db3GNN\u6027\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u786c\u4ef6\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76GNN\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGBFA\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5148\u521b\u5efa\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u4ee5\u653b\u51fb\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u5185\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u8bc6\u522b\u8106\u5f31\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728Cora\u548cPubMed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cGBFA\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5982\u5728Cora\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u7ffb\u8f6c\u4f7fGraphSAGE\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e17%\u3002", "conclusion": "GBFA\u653b\u51fb\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u51f8\u663eGNN\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical\nsuccess across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the\ngeneralization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring\neither graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the\nfirst learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping\nconnections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the\ngeneralization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest\nachievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the\nproposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification\nmaintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges\nthat support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections\nlead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a\ntwo-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified\nmatrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer.

To address this, the study presents an\nAI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm\n(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for\nhealthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series\nforecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains\nunderexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and\nProphet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM\nachieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)\nof 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:\n87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm\nis applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,\nenabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis\nfurther enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different\nfeatures on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes.

We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain\nthis phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points\nsuffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised\nfinetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled\nexperiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data\ngenerated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even\nsmaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta.

Thus, delta\nlearning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art\npost-training.

This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing\nbetween such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between\nthe attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI.\nWe begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to\nformalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human\nmonitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction\nbetween the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one\nreductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL\nfailure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL\nsetup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and\nEU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always\nachieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest\nareas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups\nand assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding unnecessary and\nunproductive human \"scapegoating\". Overall, we show how HITL setups involve\nmany technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures which are often\nout of the humans' control.

To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its\npotential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM\nassistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity,\ncategorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we\ncompare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully\ngenerate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more\nconstrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code\nconstruction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual\nencodings) based on properties of the example code and data.

Despite its remarkable empirical success,\nits theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory.

This perspective\nnecessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy\nand opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In\ncontrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like\noptimizer, expressed as $\\bm{x}_{t+1} = \\bm{x}_t - \\gamma_t\n\\frac{|\\bm{m}_t|}{{\\sqrt{\\bm{v}_t}+\\epsilon}} \\circ {\\rm Sign}(\\bm{m}_t)$.

Standard\ndiffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large\nnumber of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial\ncomputational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to\nimprove efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To\naddress this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet\nfeature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD\nenables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT,\nand effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by\nskip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the\ndistribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling\nthe model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference,\nthe LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory,\nallowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps.

To address these challenges, we developed a vision\nguided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed\npresence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation\nin real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep\nlearning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,\nand uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated\nnozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted\nusing 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to\nsimulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean\naverage precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close\nto 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision\nof 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water\nsensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones\nwhere canopy was present.

While various algorithms for BPDN have been\nproposed, they invariably suffer from drawbacks and must either favor\nefficiency at the expense of accuracy or vice versa. As such, state-of-the-art\nalgorithms remain ineffective for high-dimensional applications that require\naccurate solutions within a reasonable amount of computational time. In this\nwork, we address this issue and propose an exact and efficient algorithm for\nBPDN using differential inclusions. Specifically, we prove that a selection\nprinciple from the theory of differential inclusions turns the dual problem of\nBPDN into calculating the trajectory of an \\emph{integrable} projected\ndynamical system, that is, whose trajectory and asymptotic limit can be\ncomputed exactly. Our analysis naturally yields an exact algorithm, numerically\nup to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and\nvery fast.

However, the\ncommon lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and\ncopyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a\nspecific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising\nsolutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed\nvarious auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial\nattacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods\nand attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:\ndecoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based\nmethods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new\nbenchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9\nrepresentative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal\nthat none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or\ndistinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent\nneed for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable\nof withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation.

In this work, we propose DESIGN\n(EncrypteD GNN Inference via sErver-Side Input Graph pruNing), a novel\nframework for efficient encrypted GNN inference. DESIGN tackles the critical\nefficiency limitations of existing FHE GNN approaches, which often overlook\ninput data redundancy and apply uniform computational strategies. Our framework\nachieves significant performance gains through a hierarchical optimization\nstrategy executed entirely on the server: first, FHE-compatible node importance\nscores (based on encrypted degree statistics) are computed from the encrypted\ngraph. These scores then guide a homomorphic partitioning process, generating\nmulti-level importance masks directly under FHE. This dynamically generated\nmask facilitates both input graph pruning (by logically removing unimportant\nelements) and a novel adaptive polynomial activation scheme, where activation\ncomplexity is tailored to node importance levels.

To provide a computationally efficient alternative, we introduce\nHRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning\ntechniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)\nand a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional\nneural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise\nLinear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising\nDiffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a\nsingle model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy\nrollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity\nover the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR\noutperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves\ncompetitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the\nStormCast model of Pathak et al. [21] by: a) training on the full CONUS domain,\nb) using multiple lead times to improve long-range skill, c) training on\nanalysis data instead of the +1h post-analysis data inadvertently used in\nStormCast, and d) incorporating future GFS states as inputs, enabling\ndownscaling that improves long-lead accuracy.

Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user\ninstructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,\nand applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by\nselective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving\nimprovements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,\nenabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative\nrefinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves\ninstruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data\ngenerated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of\ndata while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the\nnon-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and\neffective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external\nsupervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRe5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Re5\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u5185\u5bb9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fee\u8ba2\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "result": "Re5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eGPT - 4o - mini\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u80dc\u738764.24%\u3002", "conclusion": "Re5\u662f\u5728\u6700\u5c11\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u589e\u5f3a\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The final dataset\ncomprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six\nfine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular\nopen-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant\nperformance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation\nin Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible\nframework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments.\nThe benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and\nevaluation code are publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6RabakBench\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4e1c\u5357\u4e9a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\uff1a\u751f\u6210\uff08\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u82f1\u8bed\u7f51\u7edc\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff09\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\uff08\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\u3001\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u7ec8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u542b\u8d855000\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u6ce8\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3011\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "RabakBench\u80fd\u5728\u4e1c\u5357\u4e9a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u6784\u5efa\u672c\u5730\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}

However, the consistent disadvantage of these\nmodels is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled\ntext in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical\npurposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces\na new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware\nAttention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three\nwell-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder\nthat encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph\nrepresentations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input\ntext that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of\nthe character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to\nlimit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to\navoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning\nphase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be\nlegible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,\nsuch as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new\nstate-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text\nrendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error\nRate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality\non high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGCDA\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8bfb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u8bfb\u3001\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4e14\u62fc\u5199\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u521b\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GCDA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53cc\u6d41\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5e26\u65b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u79bb\u635f\u5931\u3001OCR\u5faa\u73af\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u53ca\u5168\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728MARIO - 10M\u548cT2I - CompBench\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cGCDA\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u6e32\u67d3\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "GCDA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8bfb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In\nthis work, we demonstrate that ESNs constructed using deterministic rules and\nsimple topologies (MESNs) outperform standard ESNs in the task of chaotic\nattractor reconstruction.

A Theory of Long-Range Connections for the Sensorimotor Brain", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI"], "comment": "18 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows\nup a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex\nfeatures. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of\nconnections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many\nanatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical\ninterpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond\nin parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other\nevidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at\nthe same time. Given this flexibility, the word \"heterarchy\" might be a more\nsuitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new\ninterpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the\nneocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the \"Thousand Brains\nTheory\", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning\nsystem. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a\nsensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2,\ncan learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the\nhierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional\nstructure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the\ntheory by examining the different types of long-range connections between\ncortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus.

A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct\nvalidity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended\ntrait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.\nTo make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation\nusing LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which\nthe same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By\nsimulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that\nrobustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait\ntheories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and\nsimulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate\nthe ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to\nsimulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,\nmetrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective\nsurvey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like\nbehavior.

In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in\nrobot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do),\nembodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the\nconventional intuition of \"more diverse is better\". Throughout extensive\nexperiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity\nproves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer\nfrom diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)\nmulti-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment\ntransfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently\ntransfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during\nfine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,\narising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in\nhuman demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity\nmultimodality emerging as a key contributing factor.

Our methodological analysis identifies\nkey limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of\nperturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on\nperturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based\napproaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same\nimage, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance\ndisproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we\nfind limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same\nproblems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity\nmetrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent.

Existing\ndeep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,\noverlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent\nadvances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a\npowerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new\nopportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce\nLangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages\nVLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).\nLangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a\nLanguage-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT\nimages into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we\nsynergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:\nSemantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local\nsemantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and\nLanguage-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that\ndenoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba\noutperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving\ndetail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong\ngeneralizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.\nFurthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided\ninsights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion.
