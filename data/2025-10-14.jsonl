While deep\nlearning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual\ndependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most\neffective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a\ncomparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and\nstandard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a\nsimplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this\nillustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability\nto transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models\nare evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by\nheterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability\nscore is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the\nseen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for\nimbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network\narchitecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built\nenvironments."}

This paper introduces the Hybrid Multimodal Graph Index (HMGI),\na novel framework designed to bridge this gap by creating a unified system for\nefficient, hybrid queries on multimodal data. HMGI leverages the native graph\ndatabase architecture and integrated vector search capabilities, exemplified by\nplatforms like Neo4j, to combine Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)\nwith expressive graph traversal queries. Key innovations of the HMGI framework\ninclude modality-aware partitioning of embeddings to optimize index structure\nand query performance, and a system for adaptive, low-overhead index updates to\nsupport dynamic data ingestion, drawing inspiration from the architectural\nprinciples of systems like TigerVector.

Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally\nchallenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two\nvariational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model.\nIn this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural\nnetwork-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly\nutilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the\nupstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis\nand reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for\nthe upstream model.

This shift calls for\nrethinking the underlying axioms. A key property in this temporal framework is\nthe incentive for optimal arrival (I4OA), which encourages agents to join in\nthe order maximizing total worth. Alongside, we define two additional\nproperties: online individual rationality (OIR), incentivizing earlier agents\nto invite more participants, and sequential efficiency (SE), ensuring that the\ntotal worth of any sequence is fully distributed among its agents. We identify\na class of reward-sharing mechanisms uniquely characterized by these three\nproperties. The classical Shapley value does not directly apply here, so we\nconstruct its natural analogs in two variants: the sequential world, where\nrewards are defined for each sequence-player pair, and the extended world,\nwhere rewards are defined for each player alone. Properties of efficiency,\nadditivity, and null player uniquely determine these Shapley analogs in both\nworlds. Importantly, the Shapley analogs are disjoint from mechanisms\nsatisfying I4OA, OIR, and SE, and this conflict persists even for restricted\nclasses such as convex and simple TCGs.

We find that maintaining multiple\nimputation pathways may help balance the need to capture uncertainty under\nmissingness and the need for efficiency in online settings. We consider\nmultiple approaches for incorporating these pathways into learning and action\nselection.

To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed\non specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their\npredictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it\ninduces Language Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens-such\nas task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens-while underutilizing core user\ninteraction tokens that encode user-specific preferences.

By designing a fuzzing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving\nmutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs\nacross multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness\nflaws of various popular MASs: they fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of problems they\ninitially resolved successfully after applying the semantic-preserving\nmutations. Through comprehensive failure analysis, we identify a common yet\nlargely overlooked cause of the robustness issue: miscommunications between\nplanning and coding agents, where plans lack sufficient detail and coding\nagents misinterpret intricate logic, aligning with the challenges inherent in a\nmulti-stage information transformation process. Accordingly, we also propose a\nrepairing method that encompasses multi-prompt generation and introduces a new\nmonitor agent to address this issue. Evaluation shows that our repairing method\neffectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0%-88.9% of\nidentified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and\nprovides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for\ndeveloping more reliable MASs for code generation."}

To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel\nsemantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,\ndubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a\nnew textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,\ndepicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a\ncross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal\nsemantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a\nwell-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space\ncan be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of\ncross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic\nsimilarities between image and text modality.

In this\nframework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational\ndivergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual\ninformation, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single\ngeometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not\nisolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory\nfurther predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise\nto an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)\nand over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors\nminimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,\nsuch as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and\ngeneralization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are\nused to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable\nredundancy level where generalization peaks.

We evaluate CoI on mortality and\ndisease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic\nkidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods\nin predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that\nCoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease\nprogression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented\ntransparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform\nclinical decision-making."}

Free-form\ninstructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows\nencode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure\ncause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during\nexecution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent\nframework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of\nprocedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or\nunstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into\nexecutable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable\nsubroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which\nfocuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of\nprocedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in\nresponse to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures\nquality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once\nand reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also\nprovides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon\nreasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for\nreliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.\nThese results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure\nrepresentations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and\ngeneralizable execution."}

Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --\ncomputation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In\npractice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human\ncontribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed\nset of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models\nwith task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially\nsubstitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a\nhuman-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,\ngenerative models function as \\emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small\nhuman-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while\nhumans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.\nThus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the\nfundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input\nremains necessary to ground the system in the intended task."}

In this context, sourcing\ninformation from multiple perspectives is essential.\n  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for\ncontent generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that\ntogether capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model\nperspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish\ncontent generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model\nStructure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing\narchitectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data\nperspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing\nthe origins of generated content back to the training data of model.

Under review at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline\nreinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,\nmulti-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,\niterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while\nfast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded\nperformance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this\ngap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,\nlies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including\ndiffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of\nlearning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary\nDifferential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer\ndesign space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative\nTrajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns\nthe entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical\nfor offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled\nadaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative\npolicies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks."}

However, in\nsome situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it\nmore difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank\nbackground. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,\nnot necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were\ntested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid\ndatasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,\nnon-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,\nmaking classification more challenging. The second method involves the\napplication of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,\nand Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover\nbackground noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate\nthat this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and\nbackground noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without\nthe need to use background information."}

YOLOv11-Litchi\nachieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline\n- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.\nAdditionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time\ndetection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of\nYOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,\nshowcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture."}

Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from\nparasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing\nposes. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the\nimpulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that\neffectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the\nfeasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free\nflight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.\nReal robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip\nobjects to a pose target within ($\\pm$5 cm, $\\pm$45 degrees) threshold in\ndozens of trials.

In this survey, we\nexplore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual\nfoundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based\nagents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along\nthree fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as\nthe system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through\nreasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,\nwhereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their\nproblem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)\nAgentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or\nphysical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and\nsustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further\naccelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source\ntraining frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic\nMLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and\noutline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field.

The OOD datasets often include both\ncovariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and\nsemantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the\nimportance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD\ndata, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In\nthis paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set\ndata when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly\nreducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel\nOOD score, named {\\Delta}Energy. {\\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the\nvanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD\ndetection. Furthermore, {\\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD\ngeneralization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound\nmaximization for {\\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to\nnot only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,\nwhich serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this\nfinding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving\nVLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive\nexperiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by\n10% to 25% in AUROC."}

EASE introduces a\nsequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)\nEvidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into\ndecision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)\nReasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is\nadequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates\nsentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the\naccuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo\nlabels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge\nthrough interpretable reasoning.

This allows commands such as 'Please decrease\nthe temperature by 20 % in machine 1 and set the motor speed to 5000 rpm in\nmachine 2.' The large language model receives the user input and selects one of\nthree predefined tools that connect to an OPC UA server and either change or\nread the value of a node.

The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data.

We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained\non CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct\nof networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning\nprocess or non-robust inputs."}

To address this, we\npropose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for \"thinking\nwith images\" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text\nreasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into\nimages as \"visual thought\", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we\nfirst construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark\nfor Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.\nSecond, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art\nimage-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures\ninto codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model\nfor solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model\nachieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully\nvalidating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our\nwork opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides\nthe community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and\nstrong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our\ndatasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT."}
