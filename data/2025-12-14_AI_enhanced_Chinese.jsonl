We study Timeboost, a mechanism on Arbitrum that auctions a timestamp advantage, crucial under first-come first-served sequencing rules. We develop a game-theoretic model in which users choose the number of transaction copies to submit, and extend upon the baseline setting by modeling the Timeboost auction and subsequent transaction submission behavior. We show that Timeboost reduces spam and increases sequencer/DAO revenue in equilibrium relative to the baseline, transferring user payments from revert costs to auction bids. Empirically, we assemble mempool data from multiple Layer-2 networks, measuring spam via identical transactions submitted in narrow time intervals, and conduct an event study around Timeboost adoption on Arbitrum using other L2s as contemporaneous benchmarks.

If the game is furthermore monotone, an even stronger guarantee holds: Nash equilibria are unique under strictness assumptions. Unfortunately, we show that certifying concavity or monotonicity is NP-hard, already for games where utilities are multivariate polynomials and compact, convex basic semialgebraic strategy sets -- an expressive class that captures extensive-form games with imperfect recall. On the positive side, we develop two hierarchies of sum-of-squares programs that certify concavity and monotonicity of a given game, and each level of the hierarchies can be solved in polynomial time. We show that almost all concave/monotone games are certified at some finite level of the hierarchies. Subsequently, we introduce SOS-concave/monotone games, which globally approximate concave/monotone games, and show that for any given game we can compute the closest SOS-concave/monotone game in polynomial time.

In the special case where degree constraints are cardinality constraints and the query is Boolean, PANDA runs in $\\tilde O (N^{subw})$-time, where $N$ is the input size, and $subw$ is the submodular width of the query, a notion introduced by Daniel Marx (JACM 2013). When specialized to certain classes of sub-graph pattern finding problems, the $\\tilde O(N^{subw})$ runtime matches the optimal runtime possible, modulo some conjectures in fine-grained complexity (Bringmann and Gorbachev (STOC 25)). The PANDA framework is much more general, as it handles arbitrary input degree constraints, which capture common statistics and integrity constraints used in relational database management systems, it works for queries with free variables, and for both CQs and DDRs.\n  The key weakness of PANDA is the large $polylog(N)$-factor hidden in the $\\tilde O(\\cdot)$ notation. This makes PANDA completely impractical, and fall short of what is achievable with specialized algorithms. This paper resolves this weakness with two novel ideas. First, we prove a new probabilistic inequality that upper-bounds the output size of DDRs under arbitrary degree constraints. Second, the proof of this inequality directly leads to a new algorithm named PANDAExpress that is both simpler and faster than PANDA. The novel feature of PANDAExpress is a new partitioning scheme that uses arbitrary hyperplane cuts instead of axis-parallel hyperplanes used in PANDA. These hyperplanes are dynamically constructed based on data-skewness statistics carefully tracked throughout the algorithm's execution. As a result, PANDAExpress removes the $polylog(N)$-factor from the runtime of PANDA, matching the runtimes of intricate specialized algorithms, while retaining all its generality and power.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86PANDA\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPANDAExpress\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684polylog(N)\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "PANDA\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u7684polylog(N)\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u8bc1\u660e\u65b0\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4e0a\u754cDDRs\u8f93\u51fa\u5927\u5c0f\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u63d0\u51faPANDAExpress\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u504f\u659c\u7edf\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u5207\u5272\u7684\u5206\u533a\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "PANDAExpress\u7b97\u6cd5\u53bb\u9664\u4e86PANDA\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684polylog(N)\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "PANDAExpress\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559PANDA\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5176\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, by up to orders of magnitude in terms of query processing time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u96c6\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5019\u9009\u8d85\u8fb9\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5339\u914d\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u56fe\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u9876\u70b9\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u96c6\u7ea6\u675f\u52a0\u901f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5019\u9009\u8d85\u8fb9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b58\u50a8\u53ef\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5339\u914d\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u56de\u6eaf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4\u5019\u9009\u8d85\u8fb9\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We show that the underlying idea generalizes to a broad class of dynamic programs with local dependencies on directed acyclic graphs (DP DAGs). Modeling a DP as deterministic time evolution over a topologically ordered DAG with frontier width $\u03c9$ and bounded in-degree, and assuming a max-type semiring with deterministic tie breaking, we prove that in a standard offline random-access model any such DP admits deterministic traceback in space $O(\u03c9\\log T + (\\log T)^{O(1)})$ cells over a fixed finite alphabet, where $T$ is the number of states. Our construction replaces backward dynamic programs by forward-only recomputation and organizes the time order into a height-compressed recursion tree whose nodes expose small \"middle frontiers'' across which every optimal path must pass. The framework yields near-optimal traceback bounds for asymmetric and banded sequence alignment, one-dimensional recurrences, and dynamic-programming formulations on graphs of bounded pathwidth. We also show that an $\u03a9(\u03c9)$ space term (in bits) is unavoidable in forward single-pass models and discuss conjectured $\\sqrt{T}$-type barriers in streaming settings, supporting the view that space-efficient traceback is a structural property of width-bounded DP DAGs rather than a peculiarity of grid-based algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

STARS combines several innovations: dual-memory user embeddings that separate long-term preferences from short-term session intent; semantic item tokens that fuse pretrained text embeddings, learnable deltas, and LLM-derived attribute tags, strengthening content-based matching, long-tail coverage, and cold-start performance; context-aware scoring with learned calendar and event offsets; and a latency-conscious two-stage retrieval pipeline that performs offline embedding generation and online maximum inner-product search with filtering, enabling tens-of-milliseconds response times. In offline evaluations on production-scale data, STARS improves Hit@5 by more than 75 percent relative to our existing LambdaMART system. A large-scale A/B test on 6 million visits shows statistically significant lifts, including Total Orders +0.8%, Add-to-Cart on Home +2.0%, and Visits per User +0.5%.

While deep learning offers promising alternatives, existing methods often struggle with flexibility and generalization, particularly on unstructured meshes, which significantly limits their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose PhysGTO, an efficient Graph-Transformer Operator for learning physical dynamics through explicit manifold embeddings in both physical and latent spaces. In the physical space, the proposed Unified Graph Embedding module aligns node-level conditions and constructs sparse yet structure-preserving graph connectivity to process heterogeneous inputs. In the latent space, PhysGTO integrates a lightweight flux-oriented message-passing scheme with projection-inspired attention to capture local and global dependencies, facilitating multilevel interactions among complex physical correlations.

In spiking neural networks (SNNs), synaptic delays are crucial for encoding temporal structure, yet existing models treat them as fully trainable, unconstrained parameters, leading to large memory footprints, higher computational demand, and a departure from biological plausibility. In the brain, however, delays arise from physical distances between neurons embedded in space. Building on this principle, we introduce Spatial Spiking Neural Networks (SpSNNs), a framework in which neurons learn coordinates in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and delays emerge from inter-neuron distances. This replaces per-synapse delay learning with position learning, substantially reducing parameter count while retaining temporal expressiveness. Across the Yin-Yang and Spiking Heidelberg Digits benchmarks, SpSNNs outperform SNNs with unconstrained delays despite using far fewer parameters. Performance consistently peaks in 2D and 3D networks rather than infinite-dimensional delay spaces, revealing a geometric regularization effect. Moreover, dynamically sparsified SpSNNs maintain full accuracy even at 90% sparsity, matching standard delay-trained SNNs while using up to 18x fewer parameters. Because learned spatial layouts map naturally onto hardware geometries, SpSNNs lend themselves to efficient neuromorphic implementation. Methodologically, SpSNNs compute exact delay gradients via automatic differentiation with custom-derived rules, supporting arbitrary neuron models and architectures. Altogether, SpSNNs provide a principled platform for exploring spatial structure in temporal computation and offer a hardware-friendly substrate for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SpSNNs\uff09\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SNNs\uff09\u5c06\u7a81\u89e6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u751f\u7269\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SpSNNs\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7531\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5b66\u4e60\u66ff\u4ee3\u7a81\u89e6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2dSpSNNs\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eSNNs\uff0c2D\u548c3D\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u540e\u53c2\u6570\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "SpSNNs\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u662f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We propose HGC-Herd, a training-free condensation framework that generates compact yet informative heterogeneous graphs while maintaining both semantic and structural fidelity. HGC-Herd integrates lightweight feature propagation to encode multi-hop relational context and employs a class-wise herding mechanism to identify representative nodes per class, producing balanced and discriminative subsets for downstream learning tasks.

Based on these results, we discuss how specific choices of weighting distribution influence both the underlying optimization problem and statistical properties of the resulting estimator, as well as some examples for which weightings that lead to fast convergence cause bad statistical performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u52a0\u6743\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6536\u655b\u754c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5e73\u7a33\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5404\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u968f\u673a\u52a0\u6743\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u52a0\u6743\u6570\u636e\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u77e9\u6536\u7f29\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u52a0\u6743\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u3001\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u6536\u655b\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u754c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5e73\u7a33\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u9009\u62e9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u8f83\u5dee\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the metrics used to evaluate model performance have received comparatively little attention. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) has long been a standard choice for model comparison. Despite its advantages, AUROC is not always ideal, particularly for problems that are invariant to local exchange of classes (LxC), a new form of metric invariance introduced in this work. To address this limitation, we propose LxCIM (LxC-invariant metric), which is not only rank-based and invariant under local exchange of classes, but also intuitive, logically consistent, and always computable, while enabling more detailed analysis through the cumulative accuracy-decision rate curve. Moreover, LxCIM exhibits clear theoretical connections to AUROC, accuracy, and the area under the accuracy-decision rate curve (AUDRC). These relationships allow for multiple complementary interpretations: as a symmetric form of AUROC, a rank-based analogue of accuracy, or a more representative and more interpretable variant of AUDRC. Finally, we demonstrate the direct applicability of LxCIM to the bivariate causal discovery problem (which exhibits invariance to local exchange of classes) and show how it addresses the acknowledged limitations of existing metrics used in this field.

However, this paradigm fundamentally shifts the auction object from discrete ad slots to the distribution over LLM outputs, posing new challenges for designing auction mechanisms. Existing mechanisms for LLM-native advertising adopt frameworks that decouple auction and generation, which either ignore externalities or require multiple LLM inferences for ad allocation, rendering them impractical for industrial scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Auction, which to the best of our knowledge is the first learning-based generative auction mechanism that integrates auction and LLM generation for LLM-native advertising. By formulating the allocation optimization as a preference alignment problem between LLM outputs and the mechanism's objective which reflects both advertisers' expected value and user experience, we introduce Iterative Reward-Preference Optimization (IRPO) algorithm that alternately optimizes the reward model and the LLM. This approach enables the LLM to inherently model allocation externalities without any extra inference cost. We further identify the allocation monotonicity and continuity of LLM-Auction, which allows us to prove that a simple first-price payment rule exhibits favorable incentive properties. Additionally, we design an LLM-as-a-judge simulation environment to facilitate large-scale data construction and enable comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the mechanism's performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LLM-Auction significantly outperforms existing baselines in allocation efficiency, while achieving the desired mechanism properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u751f\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236LLM - Auction\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u751f\u5e7f\u544a\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u62cd\u5356\u5bf9\u8c61\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u5ffd\u7565\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u6216\u9700\u591a\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM - Auction\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165IRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u5206\u914d\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4ee5\u8bc1\u660e\u652f\u4ed8\u89c4\u5219\u6fc0\u52b1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLLM - Auction\u5728\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM - Auction\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u751f\u5e7f\u544a\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u7406\u60f3\u673a\u5236\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

This is the full version", "summary": "A $k$-defective clique is a relaxation of the traditional clique definition, allowing up to $k$ missing edges. This relaxation is crucial in various real-world applications such as link prediction, community detection, and social network analysis. Although the problems of enumerating maximal $k$-defective cliques and searching a maximum $k$-defective clique have been extensively studied, existing algorithms suffer from limitations such as the combinatorial explosion of small partial solutions and sub-optimal search spaces. To address these limitations, we propose a novel clique-first branch-and-bound framework that first generates cliques and then adds missing edges. Furthermore, we introduce a new pivoting technique that achieves a search space size of $\\mathcal{O}(3^{\\frac{n}{3}} \\cdot n^k)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. We prove that the worst-case number of maximal $k$-defective cliques is $\u03a9(3^{\\frac{n}{3}} \\cdot n^k)$ when $k$ is a constant, establishing that our algorithm's search space is worst-case optimal. Leveraging the diameter-two property of defective cliques, we further reduce the search space size to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\cdot 3^{\\frac\u03b4{3}} \\cdot (\u03b4\u0394)^k)$, where $\u03b4$ is the degeneracy and $\u0394$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. We also propose an efficient framework for maximum $k$-defective clique search based on our branch-and-bound, together with practical techniques to reduce the search space. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets with more than 1 million edges demonstrate that each of our proposed algorithms for maximal $k$-defective clique enumeration and maximum $k$-defective clique search outperforms the respective state-of-the-art algorithms by up to four orders of magnitude in terms of processing time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u652f\u9650\u754c\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u67a2\u8f74\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u679a\u4e3e\u6700\u5927k-\u7f3a\u9677\u56e2\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u5927k-\u7f3a\u9677\u56e2\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u8fdc\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u679a\u4e3e\u6700\u5927k-\u7f3a\u9677\u56e2\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u5927k-\u7f3a\u9677\u56e2\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5148\u751f\u6210\u56e2\u518d\u6dfb\u52a0\u7f3a\u5931\u8fb9\u7684\u5206\u652f\u9650\u754c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u67a2\u8f74\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7f3a\u9677\u56e2\u7684\u76f4\u5f84\u4e8c\u5c5e\u6027\u7f29\u5c0f\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u652f\u9650\u754c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5feb\u8fbe\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u679a\u4e3e\u6700\u5927k-\u7f3a\u9677\u56e2\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u5927k-\u7f3a\u9677\u56e2\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

These HID embeddings effectively learn collaborative information from historical user-item interactions, making them vulnerable to situations where most items are rarely consumed (the long-tail problem). Recent methods that incorporate auxiliary information often suffer from noisy collaborative sharing caused by co-occurrence signals or semantic homogeneity caused by flat dense embeddings. Semantic IDs (SIDs), with their capability of code sharing and multi-granular semantic modeling, provide a promising alternative. However, the collaborative overwhelming phenomenon hinders the further development of SID-based methods. The quantization mechanisms commonly compromise the uniqueness of identifiers required for modeling head items, creating a performance seesaw between head and tail items. To address this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{\\name}, a novel framework that harmonizes the SID and HID. Specifically, we devise a dual-branch modeling architecture that enables the model to capture both the multi-granular semantics within SID while preserving the unique collaborative identity of HID. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level alignment strategy that bridges the two representations, facilitating knowledge transfer and supporting robust preference modeling. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that \\name~ effectively balances recommendation quality for both head and tail items while surpassing the existing baselines.

High-mix discrete manufacturing systems require jointly optimizing mid-term production planning and machine-level scheduling under heterogeneous resources and stringent delivery commitments. We address this problem with a profit-driven integrated framework that couples a mixed-integer planning model with a machine-level scheduling heuristic. The planning layer allocates production, accessory co-production, and outsourcing under aggregate economic and capacity constraints, while the scheduling layer refines these allocations using a structure-aware procedure that enforces execution feasibility and stabilizes daily machine behavior. This hierarchical design preserves the tractability of aggregated optimization while capturing detailed operational restrictions. Evaluations are conducted on a real industrial scenario. A flexible machine-level execution scheme yields 73.3% on-time completion and significant outsourcing demand, revealing bottleneck congestion. In contrast, a stability-enforcing execution policy achieves 100% on-time completion, eliminates all outsourcing, and maintains balanced machine utilization with only 1.9 to 4.6% capacity loss from changeovers.

However, it remains an open question how neural mechanisms perform their abstract operations. We investigate a hypothesis where a distributed form of Bayesian inference, namely message passing on factor graphs, is performed by a simulated network of leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons. Specifically, we perform Gaussian belief propagation by encoding messages that come into factor nodes as spike-based signals, propagating these signals through a spiking neural network (SNN) and decoding the spike-based signal back to an outgoing message.

Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the \"curse of dimensionality,\" rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

They model evidence accumulation in simple decision tasks as a stochastic process drifting towards a decision barrier. In models where the drift rate is both time-varying within a trial and variable across trials, the high computational cost for accurate likelihood evaluation has led to the common use of a computationally convenient surrogate for parameter inference, the time-averaged drift approximation (TADA). In each trial, the TADA assumes that the time-varying drift rate can be replaced by its temporal average throughout the trial. This approach enables fast parameter inference using analytical likelihood formulas for DDMs with constant drift. In this work, we show that such an estimator is inconsistent: it does not converge to the true drift, posing a risk of biasing scientific conclusions drawn from parameter estimates produced by TADA and similar surrogates. We provide an elementary proof of this inconsistency in what is perhaps the simplest possible setting: a Brownian motion with piecewise constant drift hitting a one-sided upper boundary.

We study such an auction with one player having access to perfect information against straightforward bidders. When the opponents' valuations satisfy the ordinary substitutes condition, we show that it is optimal to bid on a fixed lot overtime. In this setting, we consider a continuous-time version of the SCA auction in which the prices follow a differential inclusion with a piecewise-constant dynamics. We show that there exists a unique solution in the sense of Filippov.

Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been utilized for automated program repair; however, their applicability to repairing cloud access control policies remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CloudFix, the first automated policy repair framework for cloud access control that combines formal methods with LLMs. Given an access control policy and a specification of allowed and denied access requests, CloudFix employs Formal Methods-based Fault Localization to identify faulty statements in the policy and leverages LLMs to generate potential repairs, which are then verified using SMT solvers. To evaluate CloudFix, we curated a dataset of 282 real-world AWS access control policies extracted from forum posts and augmented them with synthetically generated request sets based on real scenarios. Our experimental results show that CloudFix improves repair accuracy over a Baseline implementation across varying request sizes.

While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant \"popularity direction\" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

Existing approaches often treat crop interactions, such as legume-cereal complementarity, which implicitly or rely on static deterministic formulations that fail to guarantee resilience against market and climate volatility. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Layer Robust Crop Planning Framework (MLRCPF) that integrates spatial reasoning, temporal dynamics, and robust optimization. Specifically, we formalize crop-to-crop relationships through a structured interaction matrix embedded within the state-transition logic, and employ a distributionally robust optimization layer to mitigate worst-case risks defined by a data-driven ambiguity set. Evaluations on a real-world high-mix farming dataset from North China demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The framework autonomously generates sustainable checkerboard rotation patterns that restore soil fertility, significantly increasing the legume planting ratio compared to deterministic baselines.

Neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative, yet existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or fall short of the performance of modern ANN architectures. This paper presents a neuromorphic version of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models, replacing their recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity.

But this benchmark may overlap with model training data. If that is true, scores may reflect training recall, not issue-solving skill. To study this, we test two Claude models that frequently appear in top-performing agents submitted to the benchmark. We ask them to find relevant files using only issue text, and then issue text plus file paths. We then run the same setup on BeetleBox and SWE-rebench. Despite both benchmarks involving popular open-source Python projects, models performed 3 times better on SWE-Bench-Verified. They were also 6 times better at finding edited files, without any additional context about the projects themselves. This gap suggests the models may have seen many SWE-Bench-Verified tasks during training. As a result, scores on this benchmark may not reflect an agent's ability to handle real software issues, yet it continues to be used in ways that can misrepresent progress and lead to choices that favour agents that use certain models over strong agent design.

Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines.

For second-order models with confining potentials, we prove contraction and stability under kernel perturbations using a hypocoercive Lyapunov-type distance. This framework accommodates non-translation-invariant kernels and white-noise forcing, explicitly linking improved kernel estimation to enhanced trajectory prediction. Numerical examples validate these theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u542b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8f68\u8ff9\u5dee\u5f02\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u542b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u4ee5\u5e7f\u4e49\u6717\u4e4b\u4e07\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u540c\u6b65\u566a\u58f0\u8026\u5408\u4e0eVolterra\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u52a0\u6743\u7a7a\u95f4\u7528\u9884\u89e3\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e00\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u77e9\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u7528\u6b21\u5f3a\u5236Lyapunov\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bc1\u660e\u4e8c\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u52bf\u4e0b\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5dee\u5f02\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u7531\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6838\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u53d7\u6838\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6838\u548c\u767d\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u8feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6838\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u4f8b\u5b50\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

To appear at AAAI 2026", "summary": "We study the problem of fairly allocating a set of $m$ goods among $n$ agents in the asymptotic setting, where each item's value for each agent is drawn from an underlying joint distribution. Prior works have shown that if this distribution is well-behaved, then an envy-free allocation exists with high probability when $m=\u03a9(n\\log{n})$ [Dickerson et al., 2014]. Under the stronger assumption that item values are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across agents, this requirement improves to $m=\u03a9(n\\log{n}/\\log{\\log{n}})$, which is tight [Manurangsi and Suksompong, 2021]. However, these results rely on non-strategyproof mechanisms, such as maximum-welfare allocation or the round-robin algorithm, limiting their applicability in settings with strategic agents.\n  In this work, we extend the theory to a broader, more realistic class of joint value distributions, allowing for correlations among agents, atomicity, and unequal probabilities of having the highest value for an item. We show that envy-free allocations continue to exist with a high probability when $m=\u03a9(n\\log{n})$. More importantly, we give a new randomized mechanism that is truthful in expectation, efficiently implementable in polynomial time, and outputs envy-free allocations with high probability, answering an open question posed by [Manurangsi and Suksompong, 2017]. We further extend our mechanism to settings with asymptotic weighted fair division and multiple agent types and good types, proving new results in each case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6e10\u8fd1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5546\u54c1\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u8054\u5408\u4ef7\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u65b0\u968f\u673a\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5f00\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u6269\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4ef7\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u968f\u673a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5f53m = \u03a9(n log n)\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u5206\u914d\u4ecd\u5927\u6982\u7387\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u671f\u671b\u8bda\u5b9e\u3001\u53ef\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e14\u5927\u6982\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u5206\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5546\u54c1\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u516c\u5f00\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, in the context of decentralized data access within Web3.0, it is imperative to cope with efficiency concerns caused by the replication of redundant data, as well as security vulnerabilities caused by data inconsistency. To address these challenges, we develop a Trustworthy Decentralized Cooperative Caching (TDC-Cache) framework for Web3.0 to ensure efficient caching and enhance system resilience against adversarial threats. This framework features a two-layer architecture, wherein the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) layer serves as a trusted intermediary platform for decentralized caching, bridging the contents from decentralized storage and the content requests from users. In light of the complexity of Web3.0 network topologies and data flows, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decentralized Caching (DRL-DC) for TDC-Cache to dynamically optimize caching strategies of distributed oracles. Furthermore, we develop a Proof of Cooperative Learning (PoCL) consensus to maintain the consistency of decentralized caching decisions within DON. Experimental results show that, compared with existing approaches, the proposed framework reduces average access latency by 20%, increases the cache hit rate by at most 18%, and improves the average success consensus rate by 10%.

A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0).

While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries.

Classical $r$-adaptivity optimizes vertex positions but requires solving expensive auxiliary PDEs such as the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation, while classical $h$-adaptivity modifies topology through element subdivision but suffers from expensive error indicator computation and is constrained by isotropic refinement patterns that impose accuracy ceilings. Combined $hr$-adaptive techniques naturally outperform single-modality approaches, yet inherit both computational bottlenecks and the restricted cost-accuracy trade-off. Emerging machine learning methods for adaptive mesh refinement seek to overcome these limitations, but existing approaches address $h$-adaptivity or $r$-adaptivity in isolation. We present HypeR, a deep reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes mesh relocation and refinement. HypeR casts the joint adaptation problem using tools from hypergraph neural networks and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Refinement is formulated as a heterogeneous multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) where element agents decide discrete refinement actions, while relocation follows an anisotropic diffusion-based policy on vertex agents with provable prevention of mesh tangling. The reward function combines local and global error reduction to promote general accuracy. Across benchmark PDEs, HypeR reduces approximation error by up to 6--10$\\times$ versus state-of-art $h$-adaptive baselines at comparable element counts, breaking through the uniform refinement accuracy ceiling that constrains subdivision-only methods. The framework produces meshes with improved shape metrics and alignment to solution anisotropy, demonstrating that jointly learned $hr$-adaptivity strategies can substantially enhance the capabilities of automated mesh generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHypeR\u6846\u67b6\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6PDEs\u4e0a\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u6210\u672c - \u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u5904\u7406h\u6216r\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec6\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6PDEs\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684h\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u8fd1\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u5c06\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e6 - 10\u500d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u5f62\u72b6\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4e0e\u89e3\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7684hr\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In average reward DR-MGs, agents aim to maximize their worst-case infinite-horizon average reward, to ensure satisfactory performance under environment uncertainties and opponent actions. We first establish a connection between the best-response policies and the optimal policies for the induced single-agent problems. Under a standard irreducible assumption, we derive a correspondence between the optimal policies and the solutions of the robust Bellman equation, and derive the existence of stationary Nash Equilibrium (NE) based on these results. We further study DR-MGs under the weakly communicating setting, where we construct a set-valued map and show its value is a subset of the best-response policies, convex and upper hemi-continuous, and derive the existence of NE. We then explore algorithmic solutions, by first proposing a Robust Nash-Iteration algorithm and providing convergence guarantees under some additional assumptions and a NE computing oracle.

A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard measure of worst-case distinguishability between quantum processes. Here we show that a quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system can be estimated to accuracy $\\varepsilon$ in diamond distance using $O(d^4/\\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses. This scaling is essentially optimal, as it matches lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis extends to channels with input and output dimensions $d_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $d_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$, for which $O(d_{\\mathrm{in}} d_{\\mathrm{out}} k/\\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses suffice, interpolating between unitary and fully generic channels. As by-products, we obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first essentially optimal strategies for operator-norm learning of binary POVMs and isometries, and we recover optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach consists of using the channel only non-adaptively to prepare copies of the Choi state, purify them in parallel, perform sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the purifications, and analyse the resulting estimator directly in diamond distance via its semidefinite-program characterisation. While the sample complexity of state tomography in trace distance is by now well understood, our results finally settle the corresponding problem for quantum channels in diamond distance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c42\u6790\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u77e5\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u6240\u9700\u901a\u9053\u4f7f\u7528\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u7ed9\u51faO(d^4/\u03b5^2)\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548cKraus\u79e9\u7684\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u5b9a\u5728\u94bb\u77f3\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u672a\u77e5\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u901a\u9053\u4f7f\u7528\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u672a\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u9053\u5236\u5907Choi\u6001\u526f\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u7eaf\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u7eaf\u5316\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u672c\u6700\u4f18\u7eaf\u6001\u5c42\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u8868\u5f81\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u94bb\u77f3\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u5728\u94bb\u77f3\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8ed\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u81f3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u03b5\u6240\u9700O(d^4/\u03b5^2)\u6b21\u901a\u9053\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8be5\u7f29\u653e\u57fa\u672c\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548cKraus\u79e9\u7684\u901a\u9053\uff0cO(d_in d_out k/\u03b5^2)\u6b21\u901a\u9053\u4f7f\u7528\u8db3\u591f\uff1b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e8c\u5143POVM\u548c\u7b49\u8ddd\u7b97\u5b50\u8303\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u57fa\u672c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u56fa\u5b9a\u79e9\u6001\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8ff9\u8ddd\u79bb\u5c42\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u5728\u94bb\u77f3\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate LLM inference by using lightweight draft models to generate candidate tokens, which are subsequently verified by a larger, more accurate model. However, ensuring both high goodput (the effective rate of accepted tokens) and fairness across multiple draft servers cooperating with a central verification server remains an open challenge. This paper introduces GOODSPEED, a novel distributed inference framework that optimizes goodput through adaptive speculative decoding. GOODSPEED employs a central verification server that coordinates a set of heterogeneous draft servers, each running a small language model to generate speculative tokens. To manage resource allocation effectively, GOODSPEED incorporates a gradient scheduling algorithm that dynamically assigns token verification tasks, maximizing a logarithmic utility function to ensure proportional fairness across servers. By processing speculative outputs from all draft servers in parallel, the framework enables efficient collaboration between the verification server and distributed draft generators, streamlining both latency and throughput. Through rigorous fluid sample path analysis, we show that GOODSPEED converges to the optimal goodput allocation in steady-state conditions and maintains near-optimal performance with provably bounded error under dynamic workloads. These results demonstrate that GOODSPEED provides a scalable, fair and efficient solution for multi-server speculative decoding in distributed LLM inference systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGOODSPEED\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u7ecf\u5206\u6790\u5728\u7a33\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u5747\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5404\u8349\u7a3f\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GOODSPEED\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e2d\u592e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u534f\u8c03\u5f02\u6784\u8349\u7a3f\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u914d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u6d41\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u6790\uff0cGOODSPEED\u5728\u7a33\u6001\u4e0b\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u4e14\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "GOODSPEED\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results.

In this paper, we introduce, BinSeek, the first two-stage cross-modal retrieval framework for stripped binary code analysis.

To this end, we built an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline to automate training construction, also deriving a domain benchmark for future research.

We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $\u03ba=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps.

It is designed to model complex, uncertain systems whose random outputs are strongly non-Gaussian given deterministic inputs. The architecture itself is a random object stochastically generated by a latent anisotropic Gaussian random field defined on a compact, boundaryless, multiply-connected manifold. The goal is to establish a novel conceptual and mathematical framework in which neural architectures are realizations of a geometry-aware, field-driven generative process. Both the neural topology and synaptic weights emerge jointly from a latent random field. A reduced-order parameterization governs the spatial intensity of an inhomogeneous Poisson process on the manifold, from which neuron locations are sampled. Input and output neurons are identified via extremal evaluations of the latent field, while connectivity is established through geodesic proximity and local field affinity. Synaptic weights are conditionally sampled from the field realization, inducing stochastic output responses even for deterministic inputs. To ensure scalability, the architecture is sparsified via percentile-based diffusion masking, yielding geometry-aware sparse connectivity without ad hoc structural assumptions. Supervised learning is formulated as inference on the generative hyperparameters of the latent field, using a negative log-likelihood loss estimated through Monte Carlo sampling from single-observation-per-input datasets. The paper initiates a mathematical analysis of the model, establishing foundational properties such as well-posedness, measurability, and a preliminary analysis of the expressive variability of the induced stochastic mappings, which support its internal coherence and lay the groundwork for a broader theory of geometry-driven stochastic learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u67b6\u6784\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u4e14\u8f93\u51fa\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u968f\u673a\u573a\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u964d\u9636\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u786e\u5b9a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u6f5c\u5728\u573a\u8bc4\u4f30\u786e\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u573a\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u5efa\u7acb\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u7528\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u6269\u6563\u63a9\u7801\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u635f\u5931\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u91c7\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u6027\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u5c5e\u6027\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u6620\u5c04\u8868\u8fbe\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

With such techniques, there is a high prevalence of data-dependent communication and computation operations where communication is exposed, leaving as high as 1.7x ideal performance on the table. Prior works harness the fact that ML model state and inputs are already sharded, and employ careful overlap of individual computation/communication shards. While such coarse-grain overlap is promising, in this work, we instead make a case for finer-grain compute-communication overlap which we term FiCCO, where we argue for finer-granularity, one-level deeper overlap than at shard-level, to unlock compute/communication overlap for a wider set of network topologies, finer-grain dataflow and more. We show that FiCCO opens up a wider design space of execution schedules than possible at shard-level alone. At the same time, decomposition of ML operations into smaller operations (done in both shard-based and finer-grain techniques) causes operation-level inefficiency losses. To balance the two, we first present a detailed characterization of these inefficiency losses, then present a design space of FiCCO schedules, and finally overlay the schedules with concomitant inefficiency signatures. Doing so helps us design heuristics that frameworks and runtimes can harness to select bespoke FiCCO schedules based on the nature of underlying ML operations. Finally, to further minimize contention inefficiencies inherent with operation overlap, we offload communication to GPU DMA engines. We evaluate several scenarios from realistic ML deployments and demonstrate that our proposed bespoke schedules deliver up to 1.6x speedup and our heuristics provide accurate guidance in 81% of unseen scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97 - \u901a\u4fe1\u91cd\u53e0\u6280\u672fFiCCO\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f4e\u6548\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GPU DMA\u5f15\u64ce\u51cf\u5c11\u4e89\u7528\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fML\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFiCCO\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97 - \u901a\u4fe1\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f4e\u6548\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1FiCCO\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u4fe1\u5378\u8f7d\u5230GPU DMA\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe1.6\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u572881%\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "FiCCO\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fML\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u5229\u7528GPU DMA\u5f15\u64ce\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u4f4e\u6548\u635f\u5931\u3002"}}

As systems increasingly deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) applications, these systems face evolving phishing email threats that exploit their fundamental architectures.

This paper proposes LLMPEA, an LLM-based framework to detect phishing email attacks across multiple attack vectors, including prompt injection, text refinement, and multilingual attacks. We evaluate three frontier LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Grok-3) and comprehensive prompting design to assess their feasibility, robustness, and limitations against phishing email attacks. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs can detect the phishing email over 90% accuracy while we also highlight that LLM-based phishing email detection systems could be exploited by adversarial attack, prompt injection, and multilingual attacks.

A promising process is molten salt electrolysis, which typically requires temperatures in excess of 900\u00b0C. Fission reactors do not depend on solar irradiance and are thus well suited for power generation on the Moon, especially during the 14-day lunar night. As of now, fission reactors have only been considered for electric power generation, but the reactor coolant could also be used directly to heat those processes to their required temperatures. In this work, a concept for a co-generation fission power plant on the Moon that can directly heat a MSE plant to the required temperatures and provide a surplus of electrical energy for the lunar base is presented. The neutron transport code Serpent 2 is used to model a ceramic core, gas-cooled very-high-temperature microreactor design and estimate its lifetime with a burnup simulation in hot conditions with an integrated step-wise criticality search.

Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. \"Swaddling\" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average.

Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy.

We obtain an $O(MN^2\\log(NU))$ static equivalent instance for feasibility ILPs where $M$ is the number of constraints, $N$ is the number of variables and $U$ is an upper bound for the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm of the smallest feasible solution. With this, we get an $O(n^2\\log(n))$ static equivalent instance for Knapsack where $n$ is the number of items. Moreover, we give an $O(M^2N\\log(NM\u0394))$ kernel for feasibility ILPs where $\u0394$ is an upper bound for the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm of the given constraint matrix.\n  Using balancing results by Knop et al., the ConfILP and a proximity result by Eisenbrand and Weismantel we give an $O(d^2\\log(p_{\\max}))$ equivalent instance for LoadBalancing, a generalization of scheduling problems. Here $d$ is the number of different processing times and $p_{\\max}$ is the largest processing time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, the growing heterogeneity of GPU clusters and limited visibility into application characteristics pose major challenges for existing schedulers, which often rely on offline profiling or application-specific assumptions. We present RLTune, an application-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling framework that dynamically prioritizes and allocates DL jobs on heterogeneous GPU clusters. RLTune integrates RL-driven prioritization with MILP-based job-to-node mapping to optimize system-wide objectives such as job completion time (JCT), queueing delay, and resource utilization. Trained on large-scale production traces from Microsoft Philly, Helios, and Alibaba, RLTune improves GPU utilization by up to 20%, reduces queueing delay by up to 81%, and shortens JCT by as much as 70 percent. Unlike prior approaches, RLTune generalizes across diverse workloads without requiring per-job profiling, making it practical for cloud providers to deploy at scale for more efficient, fair, and sustainable DL workload management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u7528\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6RLTune\uff0c\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u5f02\u6784GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684DL\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e91\u5e73\u53f0\u627f\u8f7d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5728GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eMILP\u7684\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5230\u8282\u70b9\u6620\u5c04\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u4ea7\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u8fbe20%\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6392\u961f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fbe81%\uff0c\u7f29\u77ed\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u8fbe70%\u3002", "conclusion": "RLTune\u80fd\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9010\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4e91\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

While loop temperatures are measured, loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters are unobserved, making it impossible to diagnose hydraulic imbalances or receiver degradation using standard monitoring tools.\n  We present a physics-informed learning framework that infers (i) loop-level mass-flow ratios and (ii) time-varying receiver heat-transfer coefficients directly from routine operational data. The method exploits nocturnal homogenization periods -- when hot oil is circulated through a non-irradiated field -- to isolate hydraulic and thermal-loss effects. A differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model is discretized and embedded into an end-to-end learning pipeline optimized using historical plant data from the 50 MW Andasol 3 solar field.\n  The model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE $<2^\\circ$C) and produces physically meaningful estimates of loop imbalances and receiver heat losses. Comparison against drone-based infrared thermography (QScan) shows strong correspondence, correctly identifying all areas with high-loss receivers.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether existing approaches can effectively leverage such hybrid queries, particularly in cross-language contexts. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of representative code models and reveal three challenges: (1) insufficient semantic understanding; (2) inefficient fusion in hybrid code retrieval; and (3) weak generalization in cross-language scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniCoR, a novel self-supervised framework that learns Unified Code Representations framework designed to learn unified and robust code representations. Firstly, we design a multi-perspective supervised contrastive learning module to enhance semantic understanding and modality fusion. It aligns representations from multiple perspectives, including code-to-code, natural language-to-code, and natural language-to-natural language, enforcing the model to capture a semantic essence among modalities. Secondly, we introduce a representation distribution consistency learning module to improve cross-language generalization, which explicitly aligns the feature distributions of different programming languages, enabling language-agnostic representation learning. Extensive experiments on both empirical benchmark and large-scale benchmark show that UniCoR outperforms all baseline models, achieving an average improvement of 8.64% in MRR and 11.54% in MAP over the best-performing baseline.

The approach preserves interpretability through a parametric linear component for covariates of primary interest, while a nonparametric DNN component captures complex time-covariate interactions among nuisance variables. We refer to the method as FLEXI-Haz, a flexible hazard model with a partially linear structure. In contrast to existing DNN approaches for partially linear Cox models, FLEXI-Haz does not rely on the proportional hazards assumption. We establish theoretical guarantees: the neural network component attains minimax-optimal convergence rates based on composite Holder classes, and the linear estimator is root-n consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically efficient. Extensive simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate that FLEXI-Haz provides accurate estimation of the linear effect, offering a principled and interpretable alternative to modern methods based on proportional hazards.

However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication.

While datasets such as LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat capture real-world user-LLM conversations, few studies systematically explore the mechanisms of human-LLM collaboration in coding scenarios. What tortuous paths do users experience during the interaction process? How well do the LLMs follow instructions? Are users satisfied? In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis on human-LLM coding collaboration using LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat datasets to explore the human-LLM collaboration mechanism, LLMs' instruction following ability, and human satisfaction. This study yields interesting findings: 1) Task types shape interaction patterns(linear, star and tree), with code quality optimization favoring linear patterns, design-driven tasks leaning toward tree structures, and queries preferring star patterns; 2) Bug fixing and code refactoring pose greater challenges to LLMs' instruction following, with non-compliance rates notably higher than in information querying; 3) Code quality optimization and requirements-driven development tasks show lower user satisfaction, whereas structured knowledge queries and algorithm designs yield higher levels. These insights offer recommendations for improving LLM interfaces and user satisfaction in coding collaborations, while highlighting avenues for future research on adaptive dialogue systems.

This approach improves the physical interpretability of surrogate models while achieving high computational efficiency and accuracy. However, the performance and efficiency of PC$^2$ can still be degraded with high-dimensional parameter spaces, limited data availability, or unrepresentative training data. To address this problem, this study explores two complementary enhancements to the PC$^2$ framework. First, a numerically efficient constrained optimization solver, straightforward updating of Lagrange multipliers (SULM), is adopted as an alternative to the conventional KKT solver. The SULM method significantly reduces computational cost when solving physically constrained problems with high-dimensionality and derivative boundary conditions that require a large number of virtual points. Second, a D-optimal sampling strategy is utilized to select informative virtual points to improve the stability and achieve the balance of accuracy and efficiency of the PC$^2$. The proposed methods are integrated into the PC$^2$ framework and evaluated through numerical examples of representative physical systems governed by ordinary or partial differential equations.

However, existing Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) exhibit structural limitations in this setting: inflated local groups increase single-node repair cost, multi-node failures frequently trigger expensive global repair, and reliability degrades sharply. We identify a key root cause: local and global parity blocks are designed independently, preventing them from cooperating during repair. We present Cascaded Parity LRCs (CP-LRCs), a new family of wide stripe LRCs that embed structured dependency between parity blocks by decomposing a global parity block across all local parity blocks.

In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.\n  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \\textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \\textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone.

Specifically, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have forced the community to focus on users' data privacy. Despite the vast amount of data on developer issues available in GitHub repositories, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the issues developers of Open Source Software discuss to comply with privacy legislation. Method: In this work, we examine such discussions by mining and analyzing 32,820 issues from GitHub repositories. We partially analyzed the dataset automatically to identify law user rights and principles indicated, and manually analyzed a sample of 1,186 issues based on the type of concern addressed. Results: We devised 24 discussion categories placed in six clusters: features/bugs, consent-related, documentation, data storing/sharing, adaptability, and general compliance. Our results show that developers mainly focus on specific user rights from the legislation (right to erasure, right to opt-out, right to access), addressing other rights less frequently, while most discussions concern user consent, user rights functionality, bugs and cookies management. Conclusion: The created taxonomy can help practitioners understand which issues are discussed for law compliance, so that they ensure they address them first in their systems.

This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details.

By clustering clients and training cluster-specific models, CFL enables personalized models tailored to groups of heterogeneous clients.

This paper advocates a shift to hierarchical CFL, allowing bi-level aggregation to train cluster-specific models at the edge and a unified global model at the cloud. This shift improves training efficiency yet might introduce communication challenges. To this end, we propose CFLHKD, a novel personalization scheme for integrating hierarchical cluster knowledge into CFL. Built upon multi-teacher knowledge distillation, CFLHKD enables inter-cluster knowledge sharing while preserving cluster-specific personalization. CFLHKD adopts a bi-level aggregation to bridge the gap between local and global learning.

Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.\n  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793aAI\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u88c2\uff0c\u9700\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u5de5\u4f5c\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u516c\u6b63\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u5bb3\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u7d27\u8feb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u4e24\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u6b67\u5927\u4e14\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b64\u7acb\uff0c\u9700\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5206\u88c2\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5bf912\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4f1a\u8bae\uff082020 - 2025\uff09\u76846442\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u732e\u8ba1\u91cf\u548c\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u8005\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8d8580%\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6216\u4f26\u7406\u793e\u533a\u5185\uff0c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fde\u63a5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u8bba\u6587\u5360\u6865\u63a5\u94fe\u63a5\u8d8585%\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u5c11\u91cf\u4e2d\u95f4\u4eba\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u9694\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u5408\u6280\u672f\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u4f26\u7406\u5b66\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u516c\u6b63\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

In this work, we build upon Zorya, a concolic execution framework that translates Go binaries to Ghidra's P-Code intermediate representation to address these challenges. We added the detection of bugs in concretely not taken paths and a multi-layer filtering mechanism to concentrate symbolic reasoning on panic-relevant paths. Evaluation on five Go vulnerabilities demonstrates that panic-reachability gating achieves 1.8-3.9x speedups when filtering 33-70% of branches, and that Zorya detects all panics while existing tools detect at most two.

This paper addresses this gap by proposing the first axiomatic theory that formally defines the essential structure, scope, and limitations of LA. Derived from the psychological definition of learning and the methodological requirements of LA, the framework consists of five axioms specifying discrete observation, experience construction, state transition, and inference. From these axioms, we derive a set of theorems and propositions that clarify the epistemological stance of LA, including the inherent unobservability of learner states, the irreducibility of temporal order, constraints on reachable states, and the impossibility of deterministically predicting future learning. We further define LA structure and LA practice as formal objects, demonstrating the sufficiency and necessity of the axioms and showing that diverse LA approaches -- such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and dashboards -- can be uniformly explained within this framework. The theory provides guiding principles for designing analytic methods and interpreting learning data while avoiding naive behaviorism and category errors by establishing an explicit theoretical inference layer between observations and states.

To meet this demand, blockchain technology provides a decentralized, tamper-resistant infrastructure capable of enabling trustless collaboration among distributed quantum edge devices. This paper presents QFLchain, a novel framework that integrates QFL with blockchain to support scalable and secure 6G intelligence.

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably.

This chapter provides an overview of graph topology identification and statistical inference methods for multidimensional relational data. Approaches for undirected links connecting graph nodes are outlined, going all the way from correlation metrics to covariance selection, and revealing ties with smooth signal priors. To account for directional (possibly causal) relations among nodal variables and address the limitations of linear time-invariant models in handling dynamic as well as nonlinear dependencies, a principled framework is surveyed to capture these complexities through judiciously selected kernels from a prescribed dictionary. Generalizations are also described via structural equations and vector autoregressions that can exploit attributes such as low rank, sparsity, acyclicity, and smoothness to model dynamic processes over possibly time-evolving topologies. It is argued that this approach supports both batch and online learning algorithms with convergence rate guarantees, is amenable to tensor (that is, multi-way array) formulations as well as decompositions that are well-suited for multidimensional network data, and can seamlessly leverage high-order statistical information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6982\u8ff0\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u65e0\u5411\u548c\u6709\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u591a\u7ef4\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u65e0\u5411\u94fe\u63a5\u91c7\u7528\u4ece\u76f8\u5173\u5ea6\u91cf\u5230\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u9009\u62e9\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u6279\u91cf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

While their theoretical foundations are well studied, practical performance under real-world conditions remains less understood.\n  In this work, we present a systematic, implementation-level comparison of zk-SNARKs (Groth16) and zk-STARKs using publicly available reference implementations on a consumer-grade ARM platform. Our empirical evaluation covers proof generation time, verification latency, proof size, and CPU profiling. Results show that zk-SNARKs generate proofs 68x faster with 123x smaller proof size, but verify slower and require trusted setup, whereas zk-STARKs, despite larger proofs and slower generation, verify faster and remain transparent and post-quantum secure. Profiling further identifies distinct computational bottlenecks across the two systems, underscoring how execution models and implementation details significantly affect real-world performance.

Deep learning models often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Medical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician-derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare-class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading. Ex periments on ten multicenter datasets show consistent gains, including a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% improvmnet in F1 score of rare class, substantially outperforming strong deep learning baselines. Ablations confirm that the symbolic components act as effective clinical priors and regularizers, improving robustness under distribution shift.

However, serverless cloud users remain vulnerable to various types of attacks, including micro-architectural side-channel attacks. These attacks typically rely on the physical co-location of victim and attacker instances, and attackers will need to exploit cloud schedulers to achieve co-location with victims. Therefore, it is crucial to study vulnerabilities in serverless cloud schedulers and assess the security of different serverless scheduling algorithms. This study addresses the gap in understanding and constructing co-location attacks in serverless clouds. We present a comprehensive methodology to uncover exploitable features in serverless scheduling algorithms and devise strategies for constructing co-location attacks through normal user interfaces. In our experiments, we successfully reveal exploitable vulnerabilities and achieve instance co-location on prevalent open-source infrastructures and Microsoft Azure Functions.

This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.\n  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction.

This work investigates how a chip can be generated from a high-level object-oriented software specification, targeting introductory-level chip design learners with only very light performance requirements, while maintaining mental continuity between the chip layout and the software source program. In our approach, each software object is represented as a corresponding region on the die, producing a one-to-one structural mapping that preserves these familiar abstractions throughout the design flow. To support this mapping, we employ a modular construction strategy in which vertically composed IP blocks implement the behavioral protocols expressed in software. A direct syntactic translation, however, cannot meet hardware-level efficiency or communication constraints. For this reason, we leverage formal type systems based on sequences that check whether interactions between hardware modules adhere to the communication patterns described in the software model. We further examine hardware interconnect strategies for composing many such modules and develop layout techniques suited to this object-aligned design style.

The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems.

Traditional mechanistic models struggle with empirical parameter variability, while purely data-driven models lack physical consistency and rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ). This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual). Crucially, we implement a full UQ methodology by decomposing the total predictive variance (sigma2_total) into model uncertainty (epistemic, from GPR's posterior variance) and input uncertainty (aleatoric, analytically propagated via the Delta method for multi-variate correlated inputs). Leveraging the inherent strength of GPR in low-data regimes, the model, trained on a meagre 120 data points, achieved a state-of-the-art Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.26% and an R2 of 0.999 on the independent test data, validating a truly robust and reliable surrogate model for advanced FO process optimization and digital twin development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7406 - \u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u5411\u6e17\u900f\u6c34\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b63\u5411\u6e17\u900f\u6c34\u901a\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u68b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5404\u81ea\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7406 - \u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u503c\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3GPR\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u5168\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec5120\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.26%\uff0cR2\u4e3a0.999\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u6b63\u5411\u6e17\u900f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u53ef\u9760\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields. Experiments demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs systems and significantly improves trust scores according to a comprehensive evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u519c\u4e1a\u54a8\u8be2\u7684RAG\u6846\u67b6AgriRegion\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u54a8\u8be2\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AgriRegion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u5c42\u548c\u533a\u57df\u4f18\u5148\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fd8\u521b\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6AgriRegion - Eval\u3002", "result": "AgriRegion\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u51cf\u5c1110 - 20%\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4fe1\u4efb\u5f97\u5206\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "AgriRegion\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u519c\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u672c\u5730\u519c\u4e1a\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f00\u6e90\u7684Confucius Code Agent (CCA)\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eConfucius SDK\uff0c\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e13\u6709\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5f00\u6e90AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaConfucius SDK\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7f16\u6392\u5668\u3001\u6301\u4e45\u7b14\u8bb0\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6784\u5efa - \u6d4b\u8bd5 - \u6539\u8fdb\u5faa\u73af\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "CCA\u5728SWE - Bench - Pro\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523054.3%\u7684Resolve@1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "Confucius SDK\u548cCCA\u4e3aAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u539f\u578b\u4e0e\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5f00\u53d1\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \\textit{global} \\revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \\emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

Internet of Things and Cloud computing integrated systems (IoT-Cloud) facilitate sensing, automation, and processing for these healthcare applications. While real-time response is crucial for alleviating patient emergencies, protecting patient privacy is extremely important in data-driven healthcare. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer IoT, Edge and Cloud architecture to enhance the speed of response for emergency healthcare by distributing tasks based on response criticality and permanence of storage. Privacy of patient data is assured by proposing a Differential Privacy framework across several machine learning models such as K-means, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. We establish a comprehensive threat model identifying three adversary classes and evaluate Laplace, Gaussian, and hybrid noise mechanisms across varying privacy budgets, with supervised algorithms achieving up to 86% accuracy. The proposed hybrid Laplace-Gaussian noise mechanism with adaptive budget allocation provides a balanced approach, offering moderate tails and better privacy-utility trade-offs for both low and high dimension datasets.

As these companies become increasingly consequential, how do their transparency practices evolve? The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders. As policymakers around the world increasingly mandate certain types of transparency, this work reveals the current state of transparency for foundation model developers, how it may change given newly enacted policy, and where more aggressive policy interventions are necessary to address critical information deficits.", "AI": {"tldr": "2025\u5e74\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u8f832024\u5e74\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cIBM\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u516c\u53f8\u5904\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6e38\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u72b6\u53ca\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u516c\u53f8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5176\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5b9e\u8df5\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc72025\u5e74\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd42024\u5e74\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "2025\u5e74\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5206\u4ece2024\u5e74\u768458\u964d\u81f340\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u6700\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0cIBM\u5f97\u520695\uff0cxAI\u548cMidjourney\u4ec514\uff0c\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u8bba\u575b\u6210\u5458\u5904\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6e38\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u653f\u7b56\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u9700\u66f4\u6fc0\u8fdb\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Recent work suggests that both graph neural network (GNN)-based and transformer-based models, including large language models (LLMs), yield promising results when evaluated on curated benchmark datasets. These datasets are typically characterized by consistent data distributions and heuristic or partially noisy labels. In this study, we systematically evaluate two representative DL models-ReVeal and LineVul-across four representative datasets: Juliet, Devign, BigVul, and ICVul. Each model is trained independently on each respective dataset, and their code representations are analyzed using t-SNE to uncover vulnerability related patterns. To assess realistic applicability, we deploy these models along with four pretrained LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-o3-mini, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 on a curated dataset, VentiVul, comprising 20 recently (May 2025) fixed vulnerabilities from the Linux kernel. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle to distinguish vulnerable from non-vulnerable code in representation space and generalize poorly across datasets with differing distributions. When evaluated on VentiVul, our newly constructed time-wise out-of-distribution dataset, performance drops sharply, with most models failing to detect vulnerabilities reliably. These results expose a persistent gap between academic benchmarks and real-world deployment, emphasizing the value of our deployment-oriented evaluation framework and the need for more robust code representations and higher-quality datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cdDL\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLMs\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u5206\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u5b66\u672f\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868DL\u6a21\u578b\uff08ReVeal\u548cLineVul\uff09\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7528t - SNE\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLMs\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6VentiVul\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u975e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684VentiVul\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u672f\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u4e45\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u90e8\u7f72\u5bfc\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u793a\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

The global availability of large-scale viral sequence data presents significant opportunities for computational analysis; however, existing approaches face notable limitations. Phylogenetic tree-based methods are computationally intensive and do not scale efficiently to today's multi-million-sequence datasets. Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\\%.

However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees.

However, in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX, the time source is outside the Trusted Computing Base: a malicious host can manipulate the TEE's notion of time, jumping in time or affecting perceived time speed. Previous work (Triad) proposes protocols for TEEs to maintain a trustworthy time source by building a cluster of TEEs that collaborate with each other and with a remote Time Authority to maintain a continuous notion of passing time. However, such approaches still allow an attacker to control the operating system and arbitrarily manipulate their own TEE's perceived clock speed.

In this paper, we argue that the i.i.d. setting can and should be reframed in terms of exchangeability, a strictly more general symmetry principle. We present the implications of this reframing, alongside two core arguments: (1) a conceptual argument, based on extending the dependency of experimental causal inference on exchangeability to causal discovery; and (2) an empirical argument, showing that many existing i.i.d. causal-discovery methods are predicated on exchangeability assumptions, and that the sole extensive widely-used real-world \"i.i.d.\" benchmark (the T\u00fcbingen dataset) consists mainly of exchangeable (and not i.i.d.) examples. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset that enforces only the exchangeability assumption, without imposing the stronger i.i.d. assumption. We show that our exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors the statistical structure of the real-world \"i.i.d.\" dataset more closely than all other i.i.d. synthetic datasets.

Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences (\"chunks\") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality.

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy.

Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \\textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \\textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction.

Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \\textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy.

Traditional approaches primarily rely on historical time series data to predict the future values. However, in practical scenarios, this is often insufficient for accurate predictions due to the limited information available. To address this challenge, multimodal time series forecasting methods which incorporate additional data modalities, mainly text data, alongside time series data have been explored. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline. Experiment results with the real world market data such as crude oil price and exchange rates demonstrate that AIR effectively modulates the behavior of the time series model using textual inputs, significantly enhancing forecasting accuracy in various time series forecasting tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u606f\u8def\u7531\uff08AIR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u7cbe\u70bc\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 AIR \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u52a8\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6587\u672c\u7cbe\u70bc\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9002\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u539f\u6cb9\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u6c47\u7387\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAIR \u53ef\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u8282\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AIR \u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u7c7b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Under review for IEEE TPAMI", "summary": "Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework. Physical insights is further incorporated as a regularization term to ensure that the alignment results adhere to known physical knowledge. Next, within the multi-source transfer GP model, a sparsity penalty is imposed on the transfer coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively select the most informative source outputs and suppress negative transfer. Extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of our R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6R^2 - HGP\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u6613\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f02\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u57df\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6e90\u8fc1\u79fbGP\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eCVAE\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u7cfb\u6570\u65bd\u52a0\u7a00\u758f\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86R^2 - HGP\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "R^2 - HGP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency.

This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy.

A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models.

Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes.\n  Methods. We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.\n  Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\\% in Hartford and 13.8\\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution. The learned decision boundaries aligned with real-world outcomes and clinical observations.\n  Interpretation. Our interpretable prescriptive framework is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide transparent, data-driven recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR that improve estimated long-term outcomes both in an internal and external cohort, while remaining clinically grounded and contributing toward a more systematic and evidence-based approach to precision medicine in structural heart disease.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u4e25\u91cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u72ed\u7a84\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5904\u65b9\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u8350\u624b\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e5\u5e74\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e2d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u4e25\u91cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u72ed\u7a84\u60a3\u8005\u624b\u672f\u65b9\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u63a8\u8350\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5904\u65b9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u9884\u540e\u5339\u914d\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u4e24\u5730\u533b\u9662\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u63a8\u8350\u964d\u4f4e5\u5e74\u9884\u671f\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5904\u65b9\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u4e24\u57305\u5e74\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e20.3%\u548c13.8%\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5904\u65b9\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u624b\u672f\u65b9\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u7597\u3002"}}

Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference.

Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5de5\u4ef6\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7b49\u6e17\u6821\u51c6\u6d88\u9664\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6536\u7f29\u91cd\u5199\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u603b\u7ed3\u5426\u5b9a\u5faa\u73af\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8fed\u4ee3LLM\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u6536\u655b\u3001\u53d1\u6563\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow.

Existing approaches have largely focused on valuing on-ball actions, leaving much of defenders' true impact unmeasured. To address this gap, we propose DEFCON (DEFensive CONtribution evaluator), a comprehensive framework that quantifies player-level defensive contributions for every attacking situation in soccer. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks, DEFCON estimates the success probability and expected value of each attacking option, along with each defender's responsibility for stopping it. These components yield an Expected Possession Value (EPV) for the attacking team before and after each action, and DEFCON assigns positive or negative credits to defenders according to whether they reduced or increased the opponent's EPV. Trained on 2023-24 and evaluated on 2024-25 Eredivisie event and tracking data, DEFCON's aggregated player credits exhibit strong positive correlations with market valuations.

Considering existing RL-based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing studies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ignore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the diversity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective-adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which enhances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the entropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formulates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial objective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger answer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token-selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the effectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities.

We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns.

Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%).

In this work, we derive a unified operator-theoretoretic description of neural training dynamics directly from gradient descent. Starting from the exact evolution $\\dot e_t = -M(t)e_t$ in function space, we apply Kato perturbation theory to obtain a rigorous system of coupled mode ODEs and show that, after coarse-graining, these dynamics converge to a spectral transport-dissipation PDE \\[ \\partial_t g + \\partial_\u03bb(v g) = -\u03bbg + S, \\] where $v$ captures eigenbasis drift and $S$ encodes nonlocal spectral coupling.\n  We prove that neural training preserves functional regularity, forcing the drift to take an asymptotic power-law form $v(\u03bb,t)\\sim -c(t)\u03bb^b$. In the weak-coupling regime -- naturally induced by spectral locality and SGD noise -- the PDE admits self-similar solutions with a resolution frontier, polynomial amplitude growth, and power-law dissipation. This structure yields explicit scaling-law exponents, explains the geometry of double descent, and shows that the effective training time satisfies $\u03c4(t)=t^\u03b1L(t)$ for slowly varying $L$.\n  Finally, we show that NTK training and feature learning arise as two limits of the same PDE: $v\\equiv 0$ recovers lazy dynamics, while $v\\neq 0$ produces representation drift.

While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task.

In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks.

This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction.

Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process.

Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Moreover, downstream biological analyses confirm that the recovered cell populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures, further validating the biological relevance of our approach.

Standard methods, often relying on a fixed data-mixing ratio, struggle to manage the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences. Our extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves the final performance of various O2O RL algorithms, highlighting the importance of an adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff08ARB\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08O2O RL\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6O2O RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u56fa\u5b9a\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65b0\u5728\u7ebf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u65e9\u671f\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u201con - policyness\u201d\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff08ARB\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7531\u4e14\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cARB\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u8f7b\u65e9\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u79cdO2O RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9O2O RL\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality.

By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684NAS\u52a0\u5f3a\u65e9\u9000\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9000\u51fa\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u80fd\u4ee5\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5e73\u5747MAC\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u9000\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709NAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u9000\u51fa\u5206\u652f\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65e9\u9000\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684NAS\u52a0\u5f3a\u9000\u51fa\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u9000\u51fa\u5206\u652f\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5c42\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR - 10\u3001CIFAR - 100\u548cSVHN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4ee5\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5e73\u5747MAC\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e9\u9000\u7f51\u7edc\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks.

To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a \"Minimal-Sufficient-Clean\" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLaT - IB\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff08IB\uff09\u539f\u7406\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165MSC\u51c6\u5219\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u7f20\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u539f\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLaT - IB\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u201cMinimal - Sufficient - Clean\u201d\uff08MSC\uff09\u51c6\u5219\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u7f20\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\u5404\u90e8\u5206\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLaT - IB\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LaT - IB\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning (\"thinking\") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results.

The first contribution addresses constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under the average-cost criterion through the Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm. ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings.

General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.\n  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.\n  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.\n  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases.

While quantization techniques have successfully reduced resource requirements in standard deep learning models, their application to probabilistic models remains largely unexplored. We introduce a systematic multi-level quantization framework for Stochastic Variational Inference based BNNs that distinguishes between three quantization strategies: Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ), Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ), and Joint Quantization (JQ). Our logarithmic quantization for variance parameters, and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure are essential for calibrated uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments on Dirty-MNIST, we demonstrate that BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining both classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement. At 4 bits, Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation.

We propose \\textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \\textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\\textbf{S}earch $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{E}xtract $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{A}ssess $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \\textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \\textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \\textbf{HotpotQA} and \\textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}.

The methodology integrates machine learning techniques with qualitative insights from migration experts. This approach aims at improving the predictive capacity of data-driven models through the inclusion of a human-assessed covariate, an innovation that addresses challenges posed by sudden shifts in migration patterns and limitations in traditional datasets. The proposed methodology responds directly to the forecasting needs outlined in the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, supporting the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR).

In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR.

We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^\u03b2$ with $\u03b2<\\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $\u03b2$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution. We also examine the regime in which the attention parameter tends to infinity and the softmax approaches a hardmax, and in this setting, we establish a logarithmic rate of convergence.

We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets.

Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors.

Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms.

Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control.

We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this approach enables compositional generalization supporting complex relations between composed concepts, advancing beyond prior work that assumes simpler interactions like additive effects. Critically, we also prove that this latent hierarchical structure is provably recoverable (identifiable) from observable data like text-image pairs, a necessary step for learning such a generative process. To validate our theory, we apply insights from our theoretical framework and achieve significant improvements on benchmark datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u539f\u5219\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u539f\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u539f\u5219\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ece\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $\u03c1\\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\\geq 0.5$ after 10\\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our method introduces learnable masks across multiple levels of granularity, from entire blocks to individual neurons, within a unified optimization objective. Granularity-specific sparsity penalties guide the pruning process, allowing a comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run. Empirically, our approach identifies circuits that are smaller in nodes than those discovered by prior methods; moreover, we demonstrate that many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant, while still maintaining task performance.

Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process.

Existing spherical operators rely on rotational equivariance but often lack the flexibility for real-world complexity. We propose a general operator-design framework based on the designable spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, establishing a solid operator-theoretic foundation for spherical learning. Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation.

It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\u505a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u542b\u6bcd\u5973\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u83b7\u53d6\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\u8ba9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u542b\u6bcd\u5973\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5973\u513f\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u80fd\u63a5\u89e6\u6bcd\u4eb2\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bcd\u4eb2\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bdd\u8bed\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u83b7\u53d6\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u5e76\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f97\u5230\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u5973\u513f\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e2d\uff1b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e5f\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u83b7\u53d6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u3002"}}

Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity.

To that end, we introduce two new computationally inexpensive interpretability and steerability metrics and conduct a systematic analysis on LVLMs. Our analysis uncovers two observations; (i) a majority of SAE neurons exhibit either low interpretability or low steerability or both, rendering them ineffective for downstream use; and (ii) due to the unsupervised nature of SAEs, user-desired concepts are often absent in the learned dictionary, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set.

Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets.

In real deployments, providers distribute a global model to many edge devices, where each client personalizes the model using private data. When a deletion request is issued, clients may ignore it or falsely claim compliance, and providers cannot check their parameters or data. This makes verification difficult, especially because personalized models must forget the targeted samples while preserving local utility, and verification must remain lightweight on edge devices.\n  We introduce ZK APEX, a zero-shot personalized unlearning method that operates directly on the personalized model without retraining. ZK APEX combines sparse masking on the provider side with a small Group OBS compensation step on the client side, using a blockwise empirical Fisher matrix to create a curvature-aware update designed for low overhead. Paired with Halo2 zero-knowledge proofs, it enables the provider to verify that the correct unlearning transformation was applied without revealing any private data or personalized parameters.\n  On Vision Transformer classification tasks, ZK APEX recovers nearly all personalization accuracy while effectively removing the targeted information.

Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b9a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684ABBSPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5e73\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b9a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7f29\u653e\uff08ABBS\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u79f0\u5148\u9a8c\u89d2\uff08SPA\uff09\u635f\u5931\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "ABBSPO\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ABBSPO\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709HBox - \u76d1\u7763OOD\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002"}}

Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs.\n  We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings.

However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences.

Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines.

Beyond their interpretability benefits, counterfactuals can also be leveraged for model reconstruction, where a surrogate model is trained to replicate the behavior of a target model.

This is particularly beneficial in settings with limited access to labeled data. We propose a method that integrates original data samples with counterfactuals to approximate class prototypes using the Wasserstein barycenter, thereby preserving the underlying distributional structure of each class.

However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free.

However, its core paradigm of mapping one sequence to one structure may only be appropriate for single-fold proteins with one stable conformation. Metamorphic proteins, which can adopt multiple distinct conformations, have conformational diversity that cannot be adequately modeled by AlphaFold2. Hence, classifying whether a given protein is metamorphic or single-fold remains a critical challenge for both laboratory experiments and computational methods. To address this challenge, we developed a novel classification framework by re-purposing AlphaFold2 to generate conformational ensembles via a multiple sequence alignment sampling method. From these ensembles, we extract a comprehensive set of features characterizing the conformational ensemble's modality and structural dispersion. A random forest classifier trained on a carefully curated benchmark dataset of known metamorphic and single-fold proteins achieves a mean AUC of 0.869 with cross-validation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our integrated approach. Furthermore, by applying our classifier to 600 randomly sampled proteins from the Protein Data Bank, we identified several potential metamorphic protein candidates -- including the 40S ribosomal protein S30, whose conformational change is crucial for its secondary function in antimicrobial defense.

This article investigates these issues through the case of the BlueROV2, an open platform widely used for scientific experimentation. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, using an observation space that combines target-oriented navigation information, a virtual occupancy grid, and ray-casting along the boundaries of the operational area. The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation. The results show that the PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in highly cluttered environments, notably thanks to better local adaptation and reduced collisions.

It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations.

Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs.

We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance.

Unlike supervised classification benchmarks that measure adaptability via parameter updates, we introduce VocSim, a training-free benchmark probing the intrinsic geometric alignment of frozen embeddings. VocSim aggregates 125k single-source clips from 19 corpora spanning human speech, animal vocalizations, and environmental sounds. By restricting to single-source audio, we isolate content representation from the confound of source separation. We evaluate embeddings using Precision@k for local purity and the Global Separation Rate (GSR) for point-wise class separation. To calibrate GSR, we report lift over an empirical permutation baseline. Across diverse foundation models, a simple pipeline, frozen Whisper encoder features, time-frequency pooling, and label-free PCA, yields strong zero-shot performance. However, VocSim also uncovers a consistent generalization gap. On blind, low-resource speech, local retrieval drops sharply. While performance remains statistically distinguishable from chance, the absolute geometric structure collapses, indicating a failure to generalize to unseen phonotactics.

In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps.

This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text.

Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude.

In this paper, we study the safety degradation that comes with adapting LLMs to new tasks. We attribute this safety compromise to catastrophic forgetting and frame the problem of preserving safety when fine-tuning as a continual learning (CL) problem. We consider the fine-tuning-as-a-service setup where the user uploads their data to a service provider to get a customized model that excels on the user's selected task. We adapt several CL approaches from the literature and systematically evaluate their ability to mitigate safety degradation. These include regularization-based, memory-based, and model merging approaches. We consider two scenarios, (1) benign user data and (2) poisoned user data.

Circuit analysis -- requiring multimodal understanding and precise mathematical reasoning -- highlights these challenges. Although Gemini 2.5 Pro improves diagram interpretation and analog-circuit reasoning, it still struggles to consistently produce correct solutions when given both text and circuit diagrams. At the same time, engineering education needs scalable AI tools capable of generating accurate solutions for tasks such as automated homework feedback and question-answering. This paper presents an enhanced, end-to-end circuit problem solver built on Gemini 2.5 Pro. We first benchmark Gemini on a representative set of undergraduate circuit problems and identify two major failure modes: 1) circuit-recognition hallucinations, particularly incorrect source polarity detection, and 2) reasoning-process hallucinations, such as incorrect current directions. To address recognition errors, we integrate a fine-tuned YOLO detector and OpenCV processing to isolate voltage and current sources, enabling Gemini to re-identify source polarities from cropped images with near-perfect accuracy. To reduce reasoning errors, we introduce an ngspice-based verification loop in which Gemini generates a .cir file, ngspice simulates the circuit, and discrepancies trigger iterative regeneration with optional human-in-the-loop review. Across 83 problems, the proposed pipeline achieves a 97.59% success rate (81 correct solutions), substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro's original 79.52% accuracy.

While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp).

By modeling IAM logs as heterogeneous dynamic graphs, the proposed system captures temporal, relational, and contextual dependencies across entities such as users, roles, sessions, and access actions.

Experimental evaluation on synthesized and real world IAM datasets demonstrates that the proposed method achieves higher detection precision and recall than baseline LSTM and GCN classifiers, while maintaining scalability across multi tenant cloud environments.

In this work, we propose HeRD, a hierarchical reinforcement learning-diffusion policy that decomposes pushing tasks into two levels: high-level goal selection and low-level trajectory generation. We employ a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) agent to select intermediate spatial goals, and a low-level goal-conditioned diffusion model to generate feasible, efficient trajectories to reach them.\n  This architecture combines the long-term reward maximizing behaviour of RL with the generative capabilities of diffusion models.

However, FL remains susceptible to privacy threats that can compromise data via direct means. That said, indirectly compromising the confidentiality of the FL model architecture (e.g., a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN)) on a client device by an outsider remains unexplored. If leaked, this information can enable next-level attacks tailored to the architecture. This paper proposes a novel side-channel fingerprinting attack, leveraging flow-level and packet-level statistics of encrypted wireless traffic from an FL client to infer its deep learning model architecture. We name it FLARE, a fingerprinting framework based on FL Architecture REconnaissance. Evaluation across various CNN and RNN variants-including pre-trained and custom models trained over IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi-shows that FLARE achieves over 98% F1-score in closed-world and up to 91% in open-world scenarios. These results reveal that CNN and RNN models leak distinguishable traffic patterns, enabling architecture fingerprinting even under realistic FL settings with hardware, software, and data heterogeneity.

Machine learning (ML) methods offer increased inference speed and flexibility in capturing prior knowledge of imaging targets relative to classical optimization-based approaches; however, they perform poorly in regimes where the scattering behavior is highly nonlinear. A key limitation is that ML methods struggle to incorporate the physics governing the scattering process, which are typically inferred implicitly from the training data or loosely enforced via architectural design. In this paper, we present a method that endows a machine learning framework with explicit knowledge of problem physics, in the form of a differentiable solver representing the forward model.

Our approach is grounded in two key insights. First, informal proofs tend to proceed via a sequence of logical transitions - often implications or equivalences - without explicitly specifying intermediate results or auxiliary lemmas. In contrast, formal systems like Lean require an explicit representation of each proof state and the tactics that connect them. Second, each informal reasoning step can be viewed as an abstract transformation between proof states, but identifying the corresponding formal tactics often requires nontrivial domain knowledge and precise control over proof context. To bridge this gap, we propose a two stage framework. Rather than generating formal tactics directly, we first extract a Chain of States (CoS), a sequence of intermediate formal proof states aligned with the logical structure of the informal argument. We then generate tactics to transition between adjacent states in the CoS, thereby constructing the full formal proof. This intermediate representation significantly reduces the complexity of tactic generation and improves alignment with informal reasoning patterns. We build dedicated datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluation, and introduce an interactive framework to support tactic generation from formal states.

However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation.

This deficiency stems from two factors: evaluation metrics based on n-gram overlap that fail to capture semantic correctness, and the absence of calibrated confidence estimation. We present a framework that addresses both limitations by integrating confidence prediction into audio captioning and redefining correctness through semantic similarity. Our approach augments a Whisper-based audio captioning model with a learned confidence prediction head that estimates uncertainty from decoder hidden states. We employ CLAP audio-text embeddings and sentence transformer similarities (FENSE) to define semantic correctness, enabling Expected Calibration Error (ECE) computation that reflects true caption quality rather than surface-level text overlap. Experiments on Clotho v2 demonstrate that confidence-guided beam search with semantic evaluation achieves dramatically improved calibration (CLAP-based ECE of 0.071) compared to greedy decoding baselines (ECE of 0.488), while simultaneously improving caption quality across standard metrics.

While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: \"Contextual Blindness\". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u2018\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f2\u76ee\u2019\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Visual Funnel\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u4e14\u5f3a\u8c03\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u88c1\u526a\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f2\u76ee\u2019\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVisual Funnel\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u951a\u5b9a\u786e\u5b9a\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u518d\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u88c1\u526a\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\u88c1\u526a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u71b5\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "Visual Funnel\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u88c1\u526a\u548c\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u88c1\u526a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u88c1\u526a\u76ca\u5904\u6709\u9650\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u5bb3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u2018\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u2019\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u2018\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f2\u76ee\u2019\uff0cVisual Funnel\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

They have also proven to be an efficient alternative for generating accurate galaxy catalogs, offering a faster and less computationally expensive option compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that using only galaxy $3$D positions and radial velocities, we can train a graph neural network coupled to a moment neural network to obtain a robust machine learning based model capable of estimating the matter density parameters, $\u03a9_{\\rm m}$, with a precision of approximately 10%. The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations. This suggests that the physical relationships encoded in the phase-space of semi-analytic models are largely independent of their specific physical prescriptions, reinforcing their potential as tools for the generation of realistic mock catalogs for cosmological parameter inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u661f\u7cfb3D\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u77e9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u4f30\u7b97\u7269\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u62df\u76ee\u5f55\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u6a21\u62df\u661f\u7cfb\u5c5e\u6027\u5e38\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u661f\u7cfb\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u7b97\u7269\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u661f\u7cfb3D\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5f84\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u77e9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u4ee5\u7ea610%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f30\u7b97\u7269\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570$\u03a9_{\rm m}$\uff0c\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u5916\u63a8\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6c34\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5173\u7cfb\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5904\u65b9\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4e8e\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u76ee\u5f55\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set.

Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving \"sink\" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance.

Solving the chemical master equation that governs these systems poses a significant challenge due to the large state space exponentially growing with system sizes. The development of autoregressive neural networks offers a flexible framework for this problem; however, its efficiency is limited especially for high-dimensional systems and in scenarios with rare events. Here, we push the frontier of neural-network approach by exploiting faster optimizations such as natural gradient descent and time-dependent variational principle, achieving a 5- to 22-fold speedup, and by leveraging enhanced-sampling strategies to capture rare events. We demonstrate reduced computational cost and higher accuracy over the previous neural-network method in challenging reaction networks, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade network, the hitherto largest biological network handled by the previous approaches of solving the chemical master equation.

A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets.

To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances.

The framework establishes a highly modular architecture that strictly decouples sensing, reasoning, and control by leveraging ROS's unified communication interfaces. Crucially, we introduce an automated tool to translate ROS messages into callable MCP functions, significantly streamlining development. RoboNeuron significantly enhances cross-scenario adaptability and component flexibility, while establishing a systematic platform for horizontal performance benchmarking, laying a robust foundation for scalable real-world embodied applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRoboNeuron\u901a\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5960\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u8026\u5408\u50f5\u786c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7b49\u5de5\u7a0b\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRoboNeuron\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210LLM\u548cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0eROS\u5b9e\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u7528MCP\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u6865\uff0c\u5229\u7528ROS\u63a5\u53e3\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u52a8\u5de5\u5177\u8f6c\u6362ROS\u6d88\u606f\u3002", "result": "RoboNeuron\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6c34\u5e73\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "conclusion": "RoboNeuron\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5177\u8eab\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Recent studies have shown that self-dictionary methods can achieve high extraction accuracy; however, their high computational cost limits their applicability to large-scale hyperspectral images. Although several approaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue, it remains a major challenge. Motivated by this situation, this paper pursues a data reduction approach. Assuming that the hyperspectral image follows the linear mixing model with the pure-pixel assumption, we develop a data reduction technique that removes pixels that do not contain endmembers. We analyze the theoretical properties of this reduction step and show that it preserves pixels that lie close to the endmembers. Building on this result, we propose a data-reduced self-dictionary method that integrates the data reduction with a self-dictionary method based on a linear programming formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially reduce the computational time of the original self-dictionary method without sacrificing endmember extraction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u964d\u7ef4\u81ea\u5b57\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7aef\u5143\u63d0\u53d6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u539f\u81ea\u5b57\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u5b57\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u867d\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f46\u6311\u6218\u4ecd\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u5047\u8bbe\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u9075\u5faa\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7eaf\u50cf\u7d20\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u964d\u7ef4\u6280\u672f\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u7aef\u5143\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u964d\u7ef4\u6b65\u9aa4\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u9760\u8fd1\u7aef\u5143\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u964d\u7ef4\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u81ea\u5b57\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u539f\u81ea\u5b57\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7aef\u5143\u63d0\u53d6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6570\u636e\u964d\u7ef4\u81ea\u5b57\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u5b57\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models.

Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects.

Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split.

In light of this, we investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be leveraged to improve safety in multi-vehicle-following scenarios involving emergency braking.

Code is available at: https://github.com/PlayerYangh/Authority-Trigger", "summary": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), as valuable intellectual property, face unauthorized use. Existing protections, such as digital watermarking, are largely passive; they provide only post-hoc ownership verification and cannot actively prevent the illicit use of a stolen model. This work proposes a proactive protection scheme, dubbed ``Authority Backdoor,\" which embeds access constraints directly into the model. In particular, the scheme utilizes a backdoor learning framework to intrinsically lock a model's utility, such that it performs normally only in the presence of a specific trigger (e.g., a hardware fingerprint). But in its absence, the DNN's performance degrades to be useless.

Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u504f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u89c4\u9700\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u56db\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8868\u5f81\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5229\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bcd\u8868\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3001\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u51cf\u5c11\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u672a\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6570\u636e\u64cd\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \\textbf{O}utcome-based \\textbf{P}rocess \\textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round.

This paper presents a theoretically grounded framework for designing AI-resilient assessments, supported by formal analysis and multi-year empirical validation.\n  We make three contributions. First, we establish two theoretical results: (1) assessments composed of interconnected problems, where outputs feed into subsequent stages, are more AI-resilient than modular assessments because current language models struggle with sustained multi-step reasoning and context; and (2) semi-structured problems with deterministic success criteria provide more reliable measures of student competency than fully open-ended projects, which allow AI systems to default to familiar solution patterns. These results challenge common policy and institutional guidance that promotes open-ended assessments as the primary safeguard for academic integrity.\n  Second, we validate these results using data from four university data science courses (N = 138). While students achieve near-perfect scores on AI-assisted modular homework, performance drops by roughly 30 percentage points on proctored exams, indicating substantial AI score inflation.

Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attacks have shown that adversarial prompts can effectively bypass these mechanisms and induce T2I models to produce sensitive content, revealing critical safety vulnerabilities. However, existing attack methods implicitly assume that the attacker knows the type of deployed defenses, which limits their effectiveness against unknown or diverse defense mechanisms. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{MJA}, a \\textbf{m}etaphor-based \\textbf{j}ailbreaking \\textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming to effectively and efficiently attack diverse defense mechanisms without prior knowledge of their type by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts. Specifically, MJA consists of two modules: an LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt optimization module~(APO). MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based adversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation. Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three LLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various metaphors and contexts. To enhance attack efficiency, APO first trains a surrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then designs an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial prompts. Extensive experiments on T2I models with various external and internal defense mechanisms demonstrate that MJA outperforms six baseline methods, achieving stronger attack performance while using fewer queries.

Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones.

The framework allows administrators to express access control policies in plain language, which are then translated into vendor specific configurations. A compact schema bound intermediate representation separates human intent from device syntax and in the current prototype compiles to Palo Alto PAN OS command line configuration while remaining extensible to other platforms. Large language models are used only as assistive parsers that generate typed intermediate representation objects, while compilation and enforcement remain deterministic. The prototype integrates three validation layers, namely a static linter that checks structural and vendor specific constraints, a safety gate that blocks overly permissive rules such as any to any allows, and a Batfish based simulator that validates configuration syntax and referential integrity against a synthetic device model.

While photoplethysmography (PPG) wearables has gained popularity, existing data-driven methods for BP estimation lack interpretability. We advanced our previously proposed physiology-centered hybrid AI method-Physiological Model-Based Neural Network (PMB-NN)-in blood pressure estimation, that unifies deep learning with a 2-element Windkessel based model parameterized by R and C acting as physics constraints. The PMB-NN model was trained in a subject-specific manner using PPG-derived timing features, while demographic information was used to infer an intermediate variable: cardiac output. We validated the model on 10 healthy adults performing static and cycling activities across two days for model's day-to-day robustness, benchmarked against deep learning (DL) models (FCNN, CNN-LSTM, Transformer) and standalone Windkessel based physiological model (PM). Validation was conducted on three perspectives: accuracy, interpretability and plausibility. PMB-NN achieved systolic BP accuracy (MAE: 7.2 mmHg) comparable to DL benchmarks, diastolic performance (MAE: 3.9 mmHg) lower than DL models. However, PMB-NN exhibited higher physiological plausibility than both DL baselines and PM, suggesting that the hybrid architecture unifies and enhances the respective merits of physiological principles and data-driven techniques. Beyond BP, PMB-NN identified R (ME: 0.15 mmHg$\\cdot$s/ml) and C (ME: -0.35 ml/mmHg) during training with accuracy similar to PM, demonstrating that the embedded physiological constraints confer interpretability to the hybrid AI framework. These results position PMB-NN as a balanced, physiologically grounded alternative to purely data-driven approaches for daily hemodynamic monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Physiological Model - Based Neural Network (PMB - NN) \u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8840\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u662f\u65e5\u5e38\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u8840\u538b\u548c\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u8840\u7ba1\u529f\u80fd\u969c\u788d\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8840\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u8fdb\u5148\u524d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6df7\u5408AI\u65b9\u6cd5PMB - NN\uff0c\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e2 - \u5143\u7d20Windkessel\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5R\u548cC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528PPG\u884d\u751f\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5b9a\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7528\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u63a8\u65ad\u5fc3\u8f93\u51fa\u91cf\u3002", "result": "PMB - NN\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u538b\u548c\u8212\u5f20\u538b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522bR\u548cC\u3002", "conclusion": "PMB - NN\u517c\u5177\u751f\u7406\u539f\u7406\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u662f\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5747\u8861\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7406\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the Outcome-based Process Verifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out OPV-Bench, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment.

The package provides a simple high-level interface (AutoFusionClassifier) that trains the full pipeline end-to-end with minimal configuration, and a flexible API for advanced users.

This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "LabelFusion\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u878d\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u7b80\u5355\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u7075\u6d3bAPI\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u8003\u8651\u6210\u672c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u53d6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6bcf\u7c7b\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e0eML\u9aa8\u5e72\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u62fc\u63a5\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u5230FusionMLP\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728AG News\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe92.4%\uff0c\u572810\u7c7bReuters 21578\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8fbe92.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs.

In this work, we introduce MMSI-Video-Bench, a fully human-annotated benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs. It operationalizes a four-level framework, Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning, through 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 clips from 25 datasets and in-house videos. Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains.

As a direct consequence, events with multijet signatures will occur at increasingly high rates. To cope with the increased luminosity, being able to efficiently group jets according to their origin along the beamline is crucial, particularly at the trigger level. In this work, a novel uncertainty-aware jet regression model based on a Deep Sets architecture is introduced, DIPz, to regress on a jet origin position along the beamline. The inputs to the DIPz algorithm are the charged particle tracks associated to each jet. An event-level discriminant, the Maximum Log Product of Likelihoods (MLPL), is constructed by combining the DIPz per-jet predictions.

However, this approach does not extend to wireless multi-hop networks, where the assumptions of fixed link capacity and linear cost structure collapse due to contention for shared spectrum resources. The key challenge is that the long-term capacity of a wireless link becomes a non-linear function of its network context, including network topology, link quality, and the traffic assigned to neighboring links. In this work, we pursue a new direction of modeling wireless network under randomized medium access control by developing an analytical network digital twin (NDT) that predicts link duty cycles from network context. We generalize randomized contention as finding a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) on the conflict graph using weighted Luby's algorithm, derive an analytical model of link duty cycles, and introduce an iterative procedure that resolves the circular dependency among duty cycle, link capacity, and contention probability.

Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec4\u5408\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u6362\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6536\u96c6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u591a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec4\u5408\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u8f6c\u6362\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b66\u4e60\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u878d\u5165\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f6c\u6362\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6574\u4f53\u548c\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

To address the distributional ambiguity, we explore the design of causal affine control policies to minimize the worst-case expected regret over all distributions in the given ambiguity set. The resulting minimax optimal control problem is shown to admit an equivalent reformulation as a tractable convex program that corresponds to a regularized version of the nominal linear-quadratic stochastic control problem. While this convex program can be recast as a semidefinite program, semidefinite programs are typically solved using primal-dual interior point methods that scale poorly with the problem size in practice. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable dual projected subgradient method to compute optimal controllers to an arbitrary accuracy.

Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation.

Our starting point is the complexity class $\\textsf{NBQP}$ (\"noisy BQP\"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure.

Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline.

We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics.\n  The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u7ba1\u9053\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u9650\u7ba1\u72b6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5148\u9a8c\u51e0\u4f55\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7eaf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5f2f\u534f\u5546\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "PPO\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u5f97\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u7ba1\u72b6\u73af\u5883\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u3001\u5730\u4e0b\u6216\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Integrating these signals is challenging due to their fundamental frequency and informational disparities. In this work, we propose ImplicitRDP, a unified end-to-end visual-force diffusion policy that integrates visual planning and reactive force control within a single network. We introduce Structural Slow-Fast Learning, a mechanism utilizing causal attention to simultaneously process asynchronous visual and force tokens, allowing the policy to perform closed-loop adjustments at the force frequency while maintaining the temporal coherence of action chunks. Furthermore, to mitigate modality collapse where end-to-end models fail to adjust the weights across different modalities, we propose Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization. This auxiliary objective maps force feedback into the same space as the action, providing a stronger, physics-grounded learning signal than raw force prediction. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that ImplicitRDP significantly outperforms both vision-only and hierarchical baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates with a streamlined training pipeline.

A Progressive Investigation", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": "Code is released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/3DGen-R1", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation.

Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings. To address these issues, we first decouple the de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, and enhance it by leveraging image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for much more diverse open-set occlusion patterns. Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy. Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes.
