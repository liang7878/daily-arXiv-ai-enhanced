PI-OHAM, based on classical HAM, employs a physics-informed residual loss to optimize convergence-control parameters systematically by combining data, boundary conditions, and governing equations in the manner similar to Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The combination of the flexibility of PINNs and the analytical transparency of HAM provides the approach with high numerical stability, rapid convergence, and high consistency with traditional numerical solutions. PI-OHAM has superior accuracy-time trade-offs and faster and more accurate convergence than standard HAM and PINNs when applied to the Blasius boundary-layer problem. It is also very close to numerical standards available in the literature. PI-OHAM ensures analytical transparency and interpretability by series-based solutions, unlike purely data-driven or data-free PINNs. Significant contributions are a conceptual bridge between decades of homotopy-based analysis and modern physics-inspired methods, and a numerically aided but analytically interpretable solver of nonlinear differential equations. PI-OHAM appears as a computationally efficient, accurate and understandable alternative to nonlinear fluid flow, heat transfer and other industrial problems in cases where robustness and interpretability are important."}

We propose a multi-agent synthesis framework that explicitly models patient deception to generate high-fidelity, publicly releasable synthetic psychiatric intake records. Starting from DAIC-WOZ interviews, we construct enriched patient profiles and simulate a four-role workflow: a \\emph{Patient} completes self-rated scales and participates in a semi-structured interview under a topic-dependent honesty state; an \\emph{Assessor} selects instruments based on demographics and chief complaints; an \\emph{Evaluator} conducts the interview grounded in rater-administered scales, tracks suspicion, and completes ratings; and a \\emph{Diagnostician} integrates all evidence into a diagnostic summary. Each case links the patient profile, self-rated and rater-administered responses, interview transcript, diagnostic summary, and honesty state. We validate the framework through four complementary evaluations: diagnostic consistency and severity grading, chain-of-thought ablations, human evaluation of clinical realism and dishonesty modeling, and LLM-based comparative evaluation. The resulting corpus spans multiple disorders and severity levels, enabling controlled study of dishonesty-aware psychiatric assessment and the training and evaluation of adaptive dialogue agents."}

Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB."}

With respect to AnyPrice Share (APS) fairness, Kulkarni et al. (2024) showed that, when agents have binary marginal values, a $0.1222$-APS allocation can be found in polynomial time, and there exists an instance where no allocation is better than $0.5$-approximate APS. Very recently, Feige and Grinberg (2025) extended the problem to the asymmetric case, where agents may have different entitlements, and improved the approximation ratio to $1/6$ for general XOS valuations. In this work, we focus on the asymmetric setting with binary XOS valuations, and further improve the approximation ratio to $1/2$, which matches the known upper bound. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm to compute such an allocation. Beyond APS fairness, we also study the weighted maximin share (WMMS) fairness. Farhadi et al. (2019) showed that, a $1/n$-WMMS allocation always exists for agents with general additive valuations, and that this approximation ratio is tight. We extend this result to general XOS valuations, where a $1/n$-WMMS allocation still exists, and this approximation ratio cannot be improved even when marginal values are binary. This shows a sharp contrast to binary additive valuations, where an exact WMMS allocation exists and can be found in polynomial time."}

We demonstrate that obsolete Bitcoin mining Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) can be repurposed to create a secure, low-cost, and energy-efficient medical records system. The proposed architecture employs a four-tier hierarchical network: regional hospitals using Antminer S19 Pro (90+ TH/s), urban health centers with Antminer S9 (14 TH/s), rural clinics equipped with Lucky Miner LV06 (500 GH/s, 13W), and mobile health points with portable ASIC devices. We introduce the Deterministic Hardware Fingerprinting (DHF) paradigm, which repurposes SHA-256 mining ASICs as cryptographic proof generators, achieving 100% verification rate across 23 test proofs during 300-second validation sessions. The system incorporates Reed-Solomon LSB watermarking for medical image authentication with 30-40% damage tolerance, semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent medical record queries, and offline synchronization protocols for intermittent connectivity. Economic analysis demonstrates 96% cost reduction compared to GPU-based alternatives, with total deployment cost of $847 per rural clinic including 5-year solar power infrastructure. Validation experiments on Lucky Miner LV06 (BM1366 chip, 5nm) achieve 2.93 MH/W efficiency and confirm hardware universality. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying verifiable, tamper-proof electronic health records in regions where traditional healthcare IT infrastructure is economically unfeasible, potentially benefiting over 600 million people lacking access to basic health information systems."}

The number of rotations needed to solve the puzzle in the original and in the permissive variants of the puzzle are respectively known as the \\emph{push number} and the \\emph{drag number}, where the latter is always smaller than or equal to the former and admits an existential lower bound of $Ω(mn)$. While this lower bound is matched by an $O(mn)$ upper bound, the push number is not so well understood.

An emerging and critical challenge is how to identify conceptually relevant prior work from rapidly growing literature, and assess how a new idea differentiates from existing research. Current embedding approaches typically conflate distinct conceptual aspects into single representations and cannot support fine-grained literature retrieval; meanwhile, LLM-based evaluators are subject to sycophancy biases, failing to provide discriminative novelty assessment. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Ideation Space, a structured representation that decomposes scientific knowledge into three distinct dimensions, i.e., research problem, methodology, and core findings, each learned through contrastive training. This framework enables principled measurement of conceptual distance between ideas, and modeling of ideation transitions that capture the logical connections within a proposed idea. Building upon this representation, we propose a Hierarchical Sub-Space Retrieval framework for efficient, targeted literature retrieval, and a Decomposed Novelty Assessment algorithm that identifies which aspects of an idea are novel. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements, where our approach achieves Recall@30 of 0.329 (16.7% over baselines), our ideation transition retrieval reaches Hit Rate@30 of 0.643, and novelty assessment attains 0.37 correlation with expert judgments. In summary, our work provides a promising paradigm for future research on accelerating and evaluating scientific discovery."}

Once the prefill GPU completes its task, the KV cache must be transferred to the decode GPU. While existing works have proposed various KV cache transfer paths across different memory and storage tiers, there remains a lack of systematic benchmarking that compares their performance and energy efficiency. Meanwhile, although optimization techniques such as KV cache reuse and frequency scaling have been utilized for disaggregated serving, their performance and energy implications have not been rigorously benchmarked. In this paper, we fill this research gap by re-evaluating prefill-decode disaggregation under different KV transfer mediums and optimization strategies. Specifically, we include a new colocated serving baseline and evaluate disaggregated setups under different KV cache transfer paths. Through GPU profiling using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), we identify and compare the performance-energy Pareto frontiers across all setups to evaluate the potential energy savings enabled by disaggregation. Our results show that performance benefits from prefill-decode disaggregation are not guaranteed and depend on the request load and KV transfer mediums. In addition, stage-wise independent frequency scaling enabled by disaggregation does not lead to energy saving due to inherently higher energy consumption of disaggregated serving."}

A comprehensive feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%. While the R-squared remains modest, consistent with the noisy nature of financial returns, primary emphasis is placed on relative error reduction and directional prediction. Feature importance analysis and visual inspection further enhance interpretability. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient boosting ensembles in modeling nonlinear dynamics in volatile emerging market time series and establish a reproducible benchmark for NEPSE Index forecasting."}

EGT introduces an attention consistency loss that aligns early-exit attention maps with the final exit. The framework jointly optimizes classification accuracy and attention consistency through a weighted combination of losses. Experiments on a real-world image classification dataset demonstrate that EGT achieves up to 98.97% overall accuracy (matching baseline performance) with a 1.97x inference speedup through early exits, while improving attention consistency by up to 18.5% compared to baseline models.

In this work, we develop a framework for upgrading Wasserstein convergence guarantees for unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (uHMC) to guarantees in tail-sensitive KL and Rényi divergences. Our approach is based on one-shot couplings, which we use to establish a regularization property of the uHMC transition kernel. This regularization allows Wasserstein-2 mixing-time and asymptotic bias bounds to be lifted to KL divergence, and analogous Orlicz-Wasserstein bounds to be lifted to Rényi divergence, paralleling earlier work of Bou-Rabee and Eberle (2023) that upgrade Wasserstein-1 bounds to total variation distance via kernel smoothing.

The chosen evaluation time influences optimization because of a speed-accuracy tradeoff: shorter evaluations enable faster iteration, but are also more subject to noise. Here, we introduce a supplement to the CMA-ES optimization algorithm, named Adaptive Sampling CMA-ES (AS-CMA), which assigns sampling time to candidates based on predicted sorting difficulty, aiming to achieve consistent precision. We compared AS-CMA to CMA-ES and Bayesian optimization using a range of static sampling times in four simulated cost landscapes. AS-CMA converged on 98% of all runs without adjustment to its tunable parameter, and converged 24-65% faster and with 29-76% lower total cost than each landscape's best CMA-ES static sampling time. As compared to Bayesian optimization, AS-CMA converged more efficiently and reliably in complex landscapes, while in simpler landscapes, AS-CMA was less efficient but equally reliable. We deployed AS-CMA in an exoskeleton optimization experiment and found the optimizer's behavior was consistent with expectations. These results indicate that AS-CMA can improve optimization efficiency in the presence of noise while minimally affecting optimization setup complexity and tuning requirements."}

However, existing timer management schemes suffer from heavy software load, low precision, lack of hardware update support, and overflow. This paper proposes two novel operations for priority queues--update and group sorting--to enable hardware timer management. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first hardware priority queue to support an update operation through the composition and propagation of basic operations to modify the priorities of elements within the queue. The group sorting mechanism ensures correct timing behavior post-overflow by establishing a group boundary priority to alter the sorting process and element insertion positions. Implemented with a hybrid architecture of a one-dimension (1D) systolic array and shift registers, our design is validated through packet-level simulations for flow table timeout management. Results demonstrate that a 4K-depth, 16-bit timer queue achieves over 500 MHz (175 Mpps, 12 ns precision) in a 28nm process and over 300 MHz (116 Mpps) on an FPGA. Critically, it reduces LUTs and FFs usage by 31% and 25%, respectively, compared to existing designs."}

These tools have lowered the cost of code generation, explanation, and testing, while introducing new forms of automation into routine development tasks. In contrast, most of the software engineering and computer engineering curricula remain closely aligned with pedagogical models that equate manual syntax production with technical competence. This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model.

Such behavior is modeled by the Time-Varying Holding Cost (TVHC) problem, where each job's instantaneous holding cost increases with its current age (a job's age is the time since it arrived). The goal of the TVHC problem is to find a scheduling policy that minimizes the time-average total holding cost across all jobs.\n  However, no optimality results are known for the TVHC problem outside of the asymptotic regime. In this paper, we study a simple yet still challenging special case: A two-class M/M/1 queue in which class 1 jobs incur a non-decreasing, time-varying holding cost and class 2 jobs incur a constant holding cost.\n  Our main contribution is deriving the first optimal (non-decreasing) index policy for this special case of the TVHC problem. Our optimal policy, called LookAhead, stems from the following idea: Rather than considering each job's current holding cost when making scheduling decisions, we should look at their cost some $X$ time into the future, where this $X$ is intuitively called the ``lookahead amount.\" This paper derives that optimal lookahead amount."}

Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.\n  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches. SGFMs offer a principled path toward long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and physically structured inductive bias in next-generation generative models."}

Likelihood-based estimators typically lead to non-convex and possibly multimodal optimization landscapes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may mix exponentially slowly. We propose a class of computationally tractable estimators--plug-in and PDE-penalized M-estimators--for inverse problems defined through operator equations of the form $L_f u = g$, where $f$ is the unknown parameter and $u$ is the observed solution. The key idea is to replace the exact PDE constraint by a weakly enforced relaxation, yielding conditionally convex and, in many PDE examples, nested quadratic optimization problems that avoid evaluating the forward map $G(f)$ and do not require PDE solvers. For prototypical non-linear inverse problems arising from elliptic PDEs, including the Darcy flow model $L_f u = \\nabla\\!\\cdot(f\\nabla u)$ and a steady-state Schrödinger model, we prove that these estimators attain the best currently known statistical convergence rates while being globally computable in polynomial time. In the Darcy model, we obtain an explicit sub-quadratic $o(N^2)$ arithmetic runtime bound for estimating $f$ from $N$ noisy samples. Our analysis is based on new generalized stability estimates, extending classical stability beyond the range of the forward operator, combined with tools from nonparametric M-estimation. We also derive adaptive rates for the Darcy problem, providing a blueprint for designing provably polynomial-time statistical algorithms for a broad class of non-linear inverse problems. Our estimators also provide principled warm-start initializations for polynomial-time Bayesian computation."}

While language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent and fluent text, the lack of interpretability presents a substantial obstacle. The limited interpretability of generated text significantly impacts its practical usability, particularly in knowledge-enhanced text generation tasks that necessitate reliability and explainability. Existing methods often employ domain-specific knowledge retrievers that are tailored to specific data characteristics, limiting their generalizability to diverse data types and tasks. To overcome this limitation, we directly leverage the two-tier architecture of structured knowledge, consisting of high-level entities and low-level knowledge triples, to design our task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter. Specifically, we employ a local-global interaction scheme for structured knowledge representation learning and a hierarchical transformer-based pointer network as the backbone for selecting relevant knowledge triples and entities. By combining the strong generative ability of language models with the high faithfulness of the knowledge hunter, our model achieves high interpretability, enabling users to comprehend the model output generation process. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation on the RotoWireFG dataset and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation on the KdConv dataset. Our task-agnostic model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and corresponding language models, setting new standards on the benchmark."}

One of the main challenges in parallel BFT is the view change process that happens when the leader node fails, which can lead to performance bottlenecks. Existing parallel BFT protocols typically rely on passive view change mechanisms with blind leader rotation. Such approaches frequently select unavailable or slow nodes as leaders, resulting in degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose a View Change Optimization (VCO) model based on mixed integer programming that optimizes leader selection and follower reassignment across parallel committees by considering communication delays and failure scenarios. We applied a decomposition method with efficient subproblems and improved benders cuts to solve the VCO model. Leveraging the results of improved decomposition solution method, we propose an efficient iterative backup leader selection algorithm as views proceed. By performing experiments in Microsoft Azure cloud environments, we demonstrate that the VCO-driven parallel BFT outperforms existing configuration methods under both normal operation and faulty condition. The results show that the VCO model is effective as network size increases, making it a suitable solution for high-performance parallel BFT systems."}

The Kelly criterion for betting, long a cornerstone of portfolio theory and information theory, admits an interpretation in the limit of infinitely many repeated bets. We extend Kelly's seminal result into the single-shot and finite-betting regimes, recasting it as a resource theory of adversarial information. This allows one to quantify what it means for the gambler to have more information than the odds-maker. Given a target rate of return, after a finite number of bets, we compute the optimal strategy which maximises the probability of successfully reaching the target, revealing a risk-reward trade-off characterised by a hierarchy of Rényi divergences between the true distribution and the odds. The optimal strategies in the one-shot regime coincide with strategies maximizing expected utility, and minimising hypothesis testing errors, thereby bridging economic and information-theoretic viewpoints. We then generalize this framework to a distributed side-information game, in which multiple players observe correlated signals about an unknown state. Recasting gambling as an adversarial resource theory provides a unifying lens that connects economic and information-theoretic perspectives, and allows for generalisation to the quantum domain, where quantum side-information and entanglement play analogous roles."}

IKE is an ensemble of diverse (random) partitions, enabling robust estimation of ideal kernel in the LLM embedding space, thus reducing retrieval accuracy loss as the ensemble grows. Lightweight and based on binary encoding, it offers low memory footprint and fast bitwise computation, lowering retrieval latency.

Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%.

These divergences naturally govern acceptance probabilities and warm-start requirements for Metropolis-adjusted Markov chains. In this work, we develop a framework for upgrading Wasserstein convergence guarantees for unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (uHMC) to guarantees in tail-sensitive KL and Rényi divergences. Our approach is based on one-shot couplings, which we use to establish a regularization property of the uHMC transition kernel. This regularization allows Wasserstein-2 mixing-time and asymptotic bias bounds to be lifted to KL divergence, and analogous Orlicz-Wasserstein bounds to be lifted to Rényi divergence, paralleling earlier work of Bou-Rabee and Eberle (2023) that upgrade Wasserstein-1 bounds to total variation distance via kernel smoothing. As a consequence, our results provide quantitative control of relative density mismatch, clarify the role of discretization bias in strong divergences, and yield principled guarantees relevant both for unadjusted sampling and for generating warm starts for Metropolis-adjusted Markov chains."}

The task is challenging because, not only may there be arbitrarily different and complex relationships between predictor variables and each label, but associations among labels may exist even after accounting for effects of predictor variables. In this paper, we present a Bayesian additive regression tree (BART) framework to model the problem. BART is a nonparametric and flexible model structure capable of uncovering complex relationships within the data. Our adaptation, MLCBART, assumes that labels arise from thresholding an underlying numeric scale, where a multivariate normal model allows explicit estimation of the correlation structure among labels. This enables the discovery of complicated relationships in various forms and improves MLC predictive performance. Our Bayesian framework not only enables uncertainty quantification for each predicted label, but our MCMC draws produce an estimated conditional probability distribution of label combinations for any predictor values. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by comparing its performance with a set of models, including the oracle model with the correct functional form. Results show that our model predicts vectors of labels more accurately than other contenders and its performance is close to the oracle model. An example highlights how the method's ability to produce measures of uncertainty on predictions provides nuanced understanding of classification results."}

However, this traditional collaboration process is extremely time- and resource-intensive, resulting in only a small fraction of CPMs reaching clinical practice. This challenge intensifies when teams attempt to incorporate unstructured clinical notes, which can contain an enormous number of concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce HACHI, an iterative human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate the development of fully interpretable CPMs by enabling the exploration of concepts in clinical notes. HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process. HACHI defines concepts as simple yes-no questions that are used in linear models, allowing the clinical AI team to transparently review, refine, and validate the CPM learned in each round. In two real-world prediction tasks (acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury), HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not included in commonly-used CPMs, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods. Furthermore, HACHI reveals the critical role of the clinical AI team, such as directing the AI agent to explore concepts that it had not previously considered, adjusting the granularity of concepts it considers, changing the objective function to better align with the clinical objectives, and identifying issues of data bias and leakage."}

However, these approaches suffer from a critical limitation: our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ceiling when modeling unpopular items, where parameter-based dense models experience diminishing SNR under severe data sparsity. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SaD (Sparse and Dense), a unified framework that integrates the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the structural reliability of sparse interaction patterns. We theoretically show that aligning these dual views yields a strictly superior global SNR. Concretely, SaD introduces a lightweight bidirectional alignment mechanism: the dense view enriches the sparse view by injecting semantic correlations, while the sparse view regularizes the dense model through explicit structural signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under this dual-view alignment, even a simple matrix factorization--style dense model can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, SaD is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of existing recommender models, highlighting the enduring power of collaborative filtering when leveraged from dual perspectives. Further evaluations on real-world benchmarks show that SaD consistently outperforms strong baselines, ranking first on the BarsMatch leaderboard.

This silent degradation leads to stockouts or excess inventory without triggering any system warnings. Current industry practice relies on manual monitoring and scheduled retraining every 3-6 months, which wastes computational resources during stable periods while missing rapid drift events. Existing academic methods focus narrowly on drift detection without addressing diagnosis or remediation, and they ignore the hierarchical structure inherent in supply chain data. What retailers need is an end-to-end system that detects drift early, explains its root causes, and automatically corrects affected models. We propose DriftGuard, a five-module framework that addresses the complete drift lifecycle. The system combines an ensemble of four complementary detection methods, namely error-based monitoring, statistical tests, autoencoder anomaly detection, and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change-point analysis, with hierarchical propagation analysis to identify exactly where drift occurs across product lines. Once detected, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis diagnoses the root causes, and a cost-aware retraining strategy selectively updates only the most affected models. Evaluated on over 30,000 time series from the M5 retail dataset, DriftGuard achieves 97.8% detection recall within 4.2 days and delivers up to 417 return on investment through targeted remediation."}

Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems.

In this paper, we propose OD-LLM, the first task-adaptive compression framework explicitly designed to provide efficient and accurate on-device deployment of LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. OD-LLM uniquely integrates two complementary compression strategies: a low-rank structural compression algorithm which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to significantly reduce parameter redundancy in the model, and a novel tokenization normalization technique that better complements the low-rank decomposition process being used. Additionally, to minimize any potential performance degradation when using higher compression ratios, a novel progressive alignment algorithm is used to iteratively refine the parameters required layerwise in the target model. Empirical evaluations conducted on sequential recommendation benchmarks show that OD-LLM exhibits no loss in effectiveness when compared to the original recommendation model, when the deployed model size is halved.

However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset. Code, models, and datasets are publicly available in our project repository."}

Given i.i.d. observations from a multivariate normal distribution, GLASSO estimates the precision matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood with an \\ell_1-penalty on the off-diagonal entries. However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter λin this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global λand do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data.\n  In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by estimating brain functional connectivity from a real fMRI data set."}

Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms. The asymptotic optimality of EBC is supported through simulations on the synthetic datasets. Through simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show the performance gain of EBC and EBC-H over existing approaches."}

Once the prefill GPU completes its task, the KV cache must be transferred to the decode GPU. While existing works have proposed various KV cache transfer paths across different memory and storage tiers, there remains a lack of systematic benchmarking that compares their performance and energy efficiency. Meanwhile, although optimization techniques such as KV cache reuse and frequency scaling have been utilized for disaggregated serving, their performance and energy implications have not been rigorously benchmarked. In this paper, we fill this research gap by re-evaluating prefill-decode disaggregation under different KV transfer mediums and optimization strategies. Specifically, we include a new colocated serving baseline and evaluate disaggregated setups under different KV cache transfer paths. Through GPU profiling using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), we identify and compare the performance-energy Pareto frontiers across all setups to evaluate the potential energy savings enabled by disaggregation. Our results show that performance benefits from prefill-decode disaggregation are not guaranteed and depend on the request load and KV transfer mediums. In addition, stage-wise independent frequency scaling enabled by disaggregation does not lead to energy saving due to inherently higher energy consumption of disaggregated serving."}

A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization."}

Decades of work has helped harden C code against attackers, but C projects do not consist of only C code.

Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack. We outline our future plans to protect against pipeline poisoning by automatically checking development phase isolation. We envision a future where build system security checkers are as prevalent as program code checkers."}

We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach. We achieve millisecond-level processing and a throughput of approximately 30,000 queries per second on average, depending on system parameters. The stream reordering algorithm improves block-level group fairness by up to 95% in certain cases, and by 50-60% on average across datasets. A qualitative study further highlights the advantages of block-level fairness compared to window-level fairness."}

Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($ρ\\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($ρ= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs.

While this existence problem admits a linear-time sliding-window solution, many practical applications require optimization and packing variants beyond mere detection. We present a unified sliding-window framework based on maintaining the Parikh-vector difference between P and the current window of T , enabling permutation matching in O(n + σ) time and O(σ) space, where σ = |Σ|. Building on this foundation, we introduce a combinatorial-optimization variant that we call Maximum Feasible Substring under Pattern Supply (MFSP): find the longest substring S of T whose symbol counts are component-wise bounded by those of P . We show that MFSP can also be solved in O(n + σ) time via a two-pointer feasibility maintenance algorithm, providing an exact packing interpretation of P as a resource budget. Finally, we address non-overlapping occurrence selection by modeling each permutation match as an equal-length interval and proving that a greedy earliest-finishing strategy yields a maximum-cardinality set of disjoint matches, computable in linear time once all matches are enumerated.

Our framework addresses a major gap in empirical legal scholarship by parsing opinions into hierarchical discourse structures and using a three-stage pipeline, i.e., Dataset Construction, Discourse Analysis, and Agentic Feature Extraction. This pipeline identifies reasoning components and extract feature labels with corresponding discourse subtrees. In analyzing copyright damage rulings, we show that discourse-augmented LLM analysis outperforms traditional methods while uncovering unquantified variations in factor weighting across circuits.

We examined the flakiness of LLM-generated tests in the context of four relational database management systems: SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite. We amplified test suites with two LLMs, GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, to assess the flakiness of the generated test cases. Our results suggest that generated tests have a slightly higher proportion of flaky tests compared to existing tests. Based on a manual inspection, we found that the most common root cause of flakiness was the reliance of a test on a certain order that is not guaranteed (\"unordered collection\"), which was present in 72 of 115 flaky tests (63%). Furthermore, both LLMs transferred the flakiness from the existing tests to the newly generated tests via the provided prompt context. Our experiments suggest that flakiness transfer is more prevalent in closed-source systems such as SAP HANA than in open-source systems. Our study informs developers on what types of flakiness to expect from LLM-generated tests.

ECOpt quantifies the trade-off between these metrics as an interpretable Pareto frontier. This enables ML practitioners to make informed decisions about energy cost and environmental impact, while maximising the benefit of their models and complying with new regulations.\n  Using ECOpt, we show that parameter and floating-point operation counts can be unreliable proxies for energy consumption, and observe that the energy efficiency of Transformer models for text generation is relatively consistent across hardware. These findings motivate measuring and publishing the energy metrics of ML models. We further show that ECOpt can have a net positive environmental impact and use it to uncover seven models for CIFAR-10 that improve upon the state of the art, when considering accuracy and energy efficiency together."}

Targeting MIMO detection, a dense, NP-hard problem central to wireless communications, we fit 15 temperature replicas of a 128-node sparsified system (1,920 p-bits) entirely on-chip and achieve bit error rates significantly below conventional linear detectors. We report complete end-to-end solution times of 4.7 ms per instance, with all loading, sampling, readout, and verification overheads included. ASIC projections in 7 nm technology indicate about 90 MHz operation with less than 200 mW power dissipation, suggesting that massive parallelism across multiple chips could approach the throughput demands of next-generation wireless systems. However, sparsification introduces sensitivity to the copy-constraint strength. Employing Two-Dimensional Parallel Tempering (2D-PT), which exchanges replicas across both temperature and constraint dimensions, we demonstrate over 10X faster convergence without manual parameter tuning. These results establish an on-chip p-bit architecture and a scalable algorithmic framework for dense combinatorial optimization."}

This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability."}

We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach. We achieve millisecond-level processing and a throughput of approximately 30,000 queries per second on average, depending on system parameters. The stream reordering algorithm improves block-level group fairness by up to 95% in certain cases, and by 50-60% on average across datasets. A qualitative study further highlights the advantages of block-level fairness compared to window-level fairness."}

Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as \"diversity\" or \"debiasing\", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias.

To maximize coverage, SafePlanner performs a structural analysis of the Plan model implementation - specifically, its scene-transition logic and hierarchical control flow - and uses this insight to extract feasible scene transitions from code. It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS. It generates 20635 test cases and detects 520 hazardous behaviors, grouped into 15 root causes through manual analysis. For four of these, we applied patches based on our analysis; the issues disappeared, and no apparent side effects were observed. SafePlanner achieves 83.63 percent function and 63.22 percent decision coverage on the Plan model, outperforming baselines in both bug discovery and efficiency."}

Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a key tool for improving model interpretability, yet existing approaches rarely enforce physical plausibility. This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains. In summary, the framework generates counterfactual explanations that are both valid and physically consistent, while laying the foundation for scalable counterfactual generation in big data environments."}

Given i.i.d. observations from a multivariate normal distribution, GLASSO estimates the precision matrix by maximizing the log-likelihood with an \\ell_1-penalty on the off-diagonal entries. However, selecting an optimal regularization parameter λin this unsupervised setting remains a significant challenge. A well-known issue is that existing methods, such as out-of-sample likelihood maximization, select a single global λand do not account for heterogeneity in variable scaling or partial variances. Standardizing the data to unit variances, although a common workaround, has been shown to negatively affect graph recovery. Addressing the problem of nodewise adaptive tuning in graph estimation is crucial for applications like computational neuroscience, where brain networks are constructed from highly heterogeneous, region-specific fMRI data.\n  In this work, we develop Locally Adaptive Regularization for Graph Estimation (LARGE), an approach to adaptively learn nodewise tuning parameters to improve graph estimation and selection. In each block coordinate descent step of GLASSO, we augment the nodewise Lasso regression to jointly estimate the regression coefficients and error variance, which in turn guides the adaptive learning of nodewise penalties. In simulations, LARGE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in graph recovery, demonstrates greater stability across replications, and achieves the best estimation accuracy in the most difficult simulation settings. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by estimating brain functional connectivity from a real fMRI data set."}

Communication overhead is a central issue in SFL and can be mitigated with auxiliary networks. Yet, the fundamental client-side computation challenge remains, as back-propagation requires substantial memory and computation costs, severely limiting the scale of models that edge devices can support. To enable more resource-efficient client computation and reduce the client-server communication, we propose HERON-SFL, a novel hybrid optimization framework that integrates zeroth-order (ZO) optimization for local client training while retaining first-order (FO) optimization on the server. With the assistance of auxiliary networks, ZO updates enable clients to approximate local gradients using perturbed forward-only evaluations per step, eliminating memory-intensive activation caching and avoiding explicit gradient computation in the traditional training process. Leveraging the low effective rank assumption, we theoretically prove that HERON-SFL's convergence rate is independent of model dimensionality, addressing a key scalability concern common to ZO algorithms. Empirically, on ResNet training and language model (LM) fine-tuning tasks, HERON-SFL matches benchmark accuracy while reducing client peak memory by up to 64% and client-side compute cost by up to 33% per step, substantially expanding the range of models that can be trained or adapted on resource-limited devices."}

Their complementary roles motivate a unified modeling paradigm. Early studies to unify S&R adopt shared encoders with task-specific heads, while recent efforts reframe item ranking in both S&R as conditional generation. The latter holds particular promise, enabling end-to-end optimization and leveraging the semantic understanding of LLMs. However, existing methods rely on full fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and limits scalability. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers a more practical alternative but faces two critical challenges in unifying S&R: (1) gradient conflicts across tasks due to divergent optimization objectives, and (2) shifts in user intent understanding caused by overfitting to fine-tuning data, which distort general-domain knowledge and weaken LLM reasoning. To address the above issues, we propose Gradient Multi-Subspace Tuning (GEMS), a novel framework that unifies S&R with LLMs while alleviating gradient conflicts and preserving general-domain knowledge. GEMS introduces (1) \\textbf{Multi-Subspace Decomposition}, which disentangles shared and task-specific optimization signals into complementary low-rank subspaces, thereby reducing destructive gradient interference, and (2) \\textbf{Null-Space Projection}, which constrains parameter updates to a subspace orthogonal to the general-domain knowledge space, mitigating shifts in user intent understanding. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that GEMS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across both search and recommendation tasks, achieving superior effectiveness."}

It remains an open question whether the remarkable performance of WSD - using a decaying learning rate for only a fraction of training compared to cosine decay - is a phenomenon specific to transformer-based language models that can potentially offer new theoretical insights into their training dynamics. Inspired by the usage of learning rate schedulers as a new lens into understanding landscape geometry (e.g., river valley, connected minima, progressive sharpening), in this work we compare the WSD path of the Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model to that of a small CNN trained to classify CIFAR10 images. We observe most training signals, optimizer path features, and sharpness dynamics to be qualitatively similar in such architectures. This consistency points to shared geometric characteristics of the loss landscapes of old and new nonconvex problems, and hints to future research questions around the geometry of high dimensional optimization problems."}

We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered.

Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably.

This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration."}

However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our lookahead strategy and tool usage."}

A notable restriction is to the classes of bounded treewidth, yielding the isomorphism relaxation of Weisfeiler--Leman refinement (WL), as shown by Dvořák [JGT 2010]. The properties recognized by WL are exactly those definable in fragments of first-order logic with counting quantifiers, as shown by Cai, Fürer, and Immerman [Comb. 1992].\n  We characterize the restriction to the classes of bounded pathwidth by numbers of simplicial walks, and formalize it into a refinement procedure (SW).

However, existing spatiotemporal retrieval methods are often extensions of conventional vector search systems that rely on external filters or specialized indices to incorporate temporal and spatial constraints, leading to inefficiency, architectural complexity, and limited flexibility in handling heterogeneous modalities. To overcome these challenges, we present a unified spatiotemporal vector retrieval framework that integrates temporal, spatial, and semantic cues within a coherent similarity space while maintaining scalability and adaptability to continuous data streams. Specifically, we propose (1) a Rotary-based Unified Encoding Method that embeds time and location into rotational position vectors for consistent spatiotemporal representation; (2) a Circular Incremental Update Mechanism that supports efficient sliding-window updates without global re-encoding or index reconstruction; and (3) a Weighted Interest-based Retrieval Algorithm that adaptively balances modality weights for context-aware and personalized retrieval. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both retrieval accuracy and efficiency, while maintaining robustness under dynamic data evolution.

In such a case, the idea of distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (DFTQC) is important to demonstrate large-scale quantum computation using small-scale nodes. However, the design of distributed systems on small-scale nodes, where each node can store only one or a few logical qubits for computation, has not been explored well yet. In this paper, we propose network-based quantum computation (NBQC) to efficiently realize distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation using many small-scale nodes. A key idea of NBQC is to let computational data continuously move throughout the network while maintaining the connectivity to other nodes. We numerically show that, for practical benchmark tasks, our method achieves shorter execution times than circuit-based strategies and more node-efficient constructions than measurement-based quantum computing. Also, if we are allowed to specialize the network to the structure of quantum programs, such as peak access frequencies, the number of nodes can be significantly reduced. Thus, our methods provide a foundation in designing DFTQC architecture exploiting the redundancy of many small fault-tolerant nodes."}

In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function.

The construction and component value of these vectors often go unexamined. Our work proposes and examines DOM coordinates in a detail to understand their impact on web page segmentation. Our work finds that there is no one-size-fits-all vector, and that visual coordinates under-perform compared to DOM coordinates by about 20-30% on average. This challenges the necessity of including visual coordinates in clustering vectors. Further, our work finds that simple vectors, comprised of single coordinates, fare better than complex vectors constituting 68.2% of the top performing vectors of the pages examined. Finally, we find that if a vector, clustering algorithm, and page are properly matched, one can achieve overall high segmentation accuracy at 74%. This constitutes a 20% improvement over a naive application of vectors. Conclusively, our results challenge the current orthodoxy for segmentation vector creation, opens up the possibility to optimize page segmentation via clustering on DOM coordinates, and highlights the importance of finding mechanisms to match the best approach for web page segmentation."}

To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states.

RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains.

It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score.

However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries). We also observe that the granularity at which the plain LLM is applied has a significant impact on the cost. We therefore propose targeting first the program classes, where test generation is more efficient, and then the uncovered methods to reduce the number of LLM requests. This strategy achieves comparable (slightly higher) effectiveness while requiring about 20% fewer LLM requests."}

This inconsistency undermines trust in high-stakes applications where we want consistent predictions. We propose three approaches to reduce inconsistency among predictions for the members of the Rashomon set. The first approach is \\textbf{outlier correction}. An outlier has a label that none of the good models are capable of predicting correctly. Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased. These three approaches can be used together or separately, and they each have distinct advantages. The reconciled predictions can then be distilled into a single interpretable model for real-world deployment. In experiments across multiple datasets, our methods reduce disagreement metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy."}

However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate final answers or step-by-step coherence, overlooking the \\textit{memory-driven} mechanisms that underlie human reasoning, which involves activating anchors and attractors, then integrating them into multi-step inference. To address this gap, we propose $A^3$-Bench~ https://a3-bench.github.io, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate $A^3$-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning."}

By combining semantic parsing with retrieval-augmented generation, SpectraQuery translates open-ended questions into coordinated SQL and literature retrieval operations, producing cited answers that unify numerical evidence with mechanistic explanation. Across SQL correctness, answer groundedness, retrieval effectiveness, and expert evaluation, SpectraQuery demonstrates strong performance: approximately 80 percent of generated SQL queries are fully correct, synthesized answers reach 93-97 percent groundedness with 10-15 retrieved passages, and battery scientists rate responses highly across accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity (4.1-4.6/5).

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation."}

Communication overhead is a central issue in SFL and can be mitigated with auxiliary networks. Yet, the fundamental client-side computation challenge remains, as back-propagation requires substantial memory and computation costs, severely limiting the scale of models that edge devices can support. To enable more resource-efficient client computation and reduce the client-server communication, we propose HERON-SFL, a novel hybrid optimization framework that integrates zeroth-order (ZO) optimization for local client training while retaining first-order (FO) optimization on the server. With the assistance of auxiliary networks, ZO updates enable clients to approximate local gradients using perturbed forward-only evaluations per step, eliminating memory-intensive activation caching and avoiding explicit gradient computation in the traditional training process. Leveraging the low effective rank assumption, we theoretically prove that HERON-SFL's convergence rate is independent of model dimensionality, addressing a key scalability concern common to ZO algorithms. Empirically, on ResNet training and language model (LM) fine-tuning tasks, HERON-SFL matches benchmark accuracy while reducing client peak memory by up to 64% and client-side compute cost by up to 33% per step, substantially expanding the range of models that can be trained or adapted on resource-limited devices."}

To address these challenges, we propose M$^3$Searcher, a modular multimodal information-seeking agent that explicitly decouples information acquisition from answer derivation. M$^3$Searcher is optimized with a retrieval-oriented multi-objective reward that jointly encourages factual accuracy, reasoning soundness, and retrieval fidelity.

In contrast, when stylometry is employed as a tool for authorship verification--confirming whether a text truly originates from a claimed author--it can also be weaponized for malicious purposes. Techniques such as de-anonymization, re-identification, tracking, profiling, and downstream effects like censorship illustrate the privacy threats that stylometric analysis can enable. Building on these concerns, this paper further explores how adversarial stylometry combined with steganography can counteract stylometric analysis. We first present enhancements to our adversarial attack, $\\textit{TraceTarnish}$, providing stronger evidence of its capacity to confound stylometric systems and reduce their attribution and verification accuracy. Next, we examine how steganographic embedding can be fine-tuned to mask an author's stylistic fingerprint, quantifying the level of authorship obfuscation achievable as a function of the proportion of words altered with zero-width Unicode characters. Based on our findings, steganographic coverage of 33% or higher seemingly ensures authorship obfuscation.

However, existing studies often overlook how image type and resolution affect detection and ignore valuable textual data in Android Application Packages (APKs), such as permissions and metadata, limiting their ability to fully capture malicious behavior. The integration of multimodality, which combines image and text data, has gained momentum as a promising approach to address these limitations. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework integrating APK images and textual features to enhance Android malware detection. We systematically evaluate various image types and resolutions across different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures, including VGG, ResNet-152, MobileNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet-B4, and use LLaMA-2, a large language model, to extract and annotate textual features for improved analysis. The findings demonstrate that RGB images at higher resolutions (e.g., 256x256, 512x512) achieve superior classification performance, while the multimodal integration of image and text using the CLIP model reveals limited potential. Overall, this research highlights the importance of systematically evaluating image attributes and integrating multimodal data to develop effective malware detection for Android systems."}

During generation, the current policy uses this tree as the draft model for performing speculative decoding. To keep the cache fresh and improve draft model quality, SRT updates trees online from ongoing rollouts and proactively performs run-ahead generation during idle GPU bubbles. Integrated into standard RL pipelines (\\textit{e.g.}, PPO, GRPO and DAPO) and multi-turn settings, SRT consistently reduces generation and step latency and lowers per-token inference cost, achieving up to 2.08x wall-clock time speedup during rollout."}

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs."}

ECOpt quantifies the trade-off between these metrics as an interpretable Pareto frontier. This enables ML practitioners to make informed decisions about energy cost and environmental impact, while maximising the benefit of their models and complying with new regulations.\n  Using ECOpt, we show that parameter and floating-point operation counts can be unreliable proxies for energy consumption, and observe that the energy efficiency of Transformer models for text generation is relatively consistent across hardware. These findings motivate measuring and publishing the energy metrics of ML models. We further show that ECOpt can have a net positive environmental impact and use it to uncover seven models for CIFAR-10 that improve upon the state of the art, when considering accuracy and energy efficiency together."}

It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts.

Our approach follows a model-based paradigm, using Coloured Timed Petri Nets to represent the scheduling environment, and Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization to enable dynamic decision-making while restricting the agent to feasible actions at each decision point. To simulate realistic industrial conditions, dynamic job arrivals are modeled using a Gamma distribution, which captures complex temporal patterns such as bursts, clustering, and fluctuating workloads. Machine failures are modeled using a Weibull distribution to represent age-dependent degradation and wear-out dynamics. These stochastic models enable the framework to reflect real-world manufacturing scenarios better. In addition, we study two action-masking strategies: a non-gradient approach that overrides the probabilities of invalid actions, and a gradient-based approach that assigns negative gradients to invalid actions within the policy network. We conduct extensive experiments on dynamic JSSP benchmarks, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms traditional heuristic and rule-based approaches in terms of makespan minimization. The results highlight the strength of combining interpretable Petri-net-based models with adaptive reinforcement learning policies, yielding a resilient, scalable, and explainable framework for real-time scheduling in dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environments."}

These concerns are particularly serious and urgent today in light of the rising levels of democratic erosion worldwide, the emerging capabilities of generative AI technologies such as AI persuasion, and the increasing concentration of economic and political power in the hands of Big Tech. This raises the question of what alternative IA infrastructure we must reimagine and build to mitigate the risks of authoritarian capture of our information ecosystems. We explore this question through the lens of Paulo Freire's theories of emancipatory pedagogy. Freire's theories provide a radically different lens for exploring IA's sociotechnical concerns relative to the current dominating frames of fairness, accountability, confidentiality, transparency, and safety. We make explicit, with the intention to challenge, the dichotomy of how we relate to technology as either technologists (who envision and build technology) and its users. We posit that this mirrors the teacher-student relationship in Freire's analysis. By extending Freire's analysis to IA, we challenge the notion that it is the burden of the (altruistic) technologists to come up with interventions to mitigate the risks that emerging technologies pose to marginalized communities. Instead, we advocate that the first task for the technologists is to pose these as problems to the marginalized communities, to encourage them to make and unmake the technology as part of their material struggle against oppression. Their second task is to redesign our online technology stacks to structurally expose spaces for community members to co-opt and co-construct the technology in aid of their emancipatory struggles. We operationalize Freire's theories to develop a problem-posing framework for envisioning emancipatory IA platforms of the future."}

ZK programming languages, like Noir, have been proposed to simplify the description of these circuits. A developer can write a Noir program using traditional high-level constructs that can be compiled into a lower-level ACIR (Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation), which is essentially a high-level description of an arithmetic circuit. In this paper, we formalise some of the ACIR language using SMT-LIB and its extended theory of finite fields. We use this formalisation to create an open-source formal verifier for the Noir language using the SMT solver cvc5. Our verifier can be used to check whether Noir programs behave appropriately. For instance, it can be used to check whether a Noir program has been properly constrained, that is, the finite-field polynomial equations generated truly capture the intended relation.

As such, we have a distinct and more challenging setting for autonomous driving. In this work, we consider a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning approach for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic, where the associated Markov Decision Process we formulate is influenced from existing approaches tied to reinforcement learning frameworks. In addition, MCTS is equipped with a pre-trained neural network (NN) that guides the selection phase. This procedure incorporates the predictive capabilities of NNs for a more informed tree search process under computational constraints. In our experimental evaluation, we consider metrics that address both safety (through collision rates) and efficacy (through measured speed). Then, we examine: (a) the influence of isotropic state information for vehicles in a lane-free environment, resulting in nudging behaviour--vehicles' policy reacts due to the presence of faster tailing ones, (b) the acceleration of performance for the NN-guided variant of MCTS, and (c) the trade-off between computational resources and solution quality."}

This study leverages an industry-scale dataset consisting of approximately 70,000 compressive strength test records to evaluate and compare multiple predictive approaches, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, transformer-based neural networks, and embedding-based neural networks. The models incorporate key mixture design and placement variables such as water cement ratio, cementitious material content, slump, air content, temperature, and placement conditions. Results indicate that the embedding-based neural network consistently outperforms traditional machine learning and transformer-based models, achieving a mean 28-day prediction error of approximately 2.5%.

This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench. We evaluated some leading close-source and open-source models at present and revealed their flaws in long-term task-oriented interaction. Furthermore, our fine-tuned model trained using synthetic data for supervised learning achieves a task completion rate of 85.19% for complex tasks including shifts in user intent, outperforming other models under test.

Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively.

Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries. Extensive evaluations on five multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFSM. In particular, EvoFSM reaches 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark. Additional results on interactive decision-making tasks further validate its generalization."}

Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training. We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization. Our trained model Eva-4B (4B parameters) achieves 81.3 percent accuracy, outperforming its base by 25 percentage points and approaching frontier LLM performance at a fraction of inference cost."}

Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents."}

Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning."}

Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning."}

In this paper, we propose PRISM: Probability Reconstruction via Shapley Measures, a framework that brings transparency and precision to LLM-based probability estimation. PRISM decomposes an LLM's prediction by quantifying the marginal contribution of each input factor using Shapley values. These factor-level contributions are then aggregated to reconstruct a calibrated final estimate. In our experiments, we demonstrate PRISM improves predictive accuracy over direct prompting and other baselines, across multiple domains including finance, healthcare, and agriculture. Beyond performance, PRISM provides a transparent prediction pipeline: our case studies visualize how individual factors shape the final estimate, helping build trust in LLM-based decision support systems."}

However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios.

Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms.

To address this, we propose BalDRO, a novel and efficient framework for balanced LLM unlearning. BalDRO formulates unlearning as a min-sup process: an inner step identifies a worst-case data distribution that emphasizes hard-to-unlearn samples, while an outer step updates model parameters under this distribution. We instantiate BalDRO via two efficient variants: BalDRO-G, a discrete GroupDRO-based approximation focusing on high-loss subsets, and BalDRO-DV, a continuous Donsker-Varadhan dual method enabling smooth adaptive weighting within standard training pipelines. Experiments on TOFU and MUSE show that BalDRO significantly improves both forgetting quality and model utility over existing methods, and we release code for reproducibility."}

Once the prefill GPU completes its task, the KV cache must be transferred to the decode GPU. While existing works have proposed various KV cache transfer paths across different memory and storage tiers, there remains a lack of systematic benchmarking that compares their performance and energy efficiency. Meanwhile, although optimization techniques such as KV cache reuse and frequency scaling have been utilized for disaggregated serving, their performance and energy implications have not been rigorously benchmarked. In this paper, we fill this research gap by re-evaluating prefill-decode disaggregation under different KV transfer mediums and optimization strategies. Specifically, we include a new colocated serving baseline and evaluate disaggregated setups under different KV cache transfer paths. Through GPU profiling using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), we identify and compare the performance-energy Pareto frontiers across all setups to evaluate the potential energy savings enabled by disaggregation. Our results show that performance benefits from prefill-decode disaggregation are not guaranteed and depend on the request load and KV transfer mediums. In addition, stage-wise independent frequency scaling enabled by disaggregation does not lead to energy saving due to inherently higher energy consumption of disaggregated serving."}

Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization. FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this highly popular benchmark. More importantly, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies over data, training, filtering, and rewarding strategies, thoroughly validating their effectiveness."}

To bridge this gap, we explore a database-centric approach that leverages intrinsic, fine-grained information residing in relational databases to construct missing evidence and improve Text-to-SQL accuracy under annotation-scarce conditions. Our key hypothesis is that when a query requires multi-step reasoning over extensive table information, existing methods often struggle to reliably identify and utilize the truly relevant knowledge. We therefore propose to \"cache\" query-relevant knowledge on the database side in advance, so that it can be selectively activated at inference time. Based on this idea, we introduce Companion Agents (CA), a new Text-to-SQL paradigm that incorporates a group of agents accompanying database schemas to proactively mine and consolidate hidden inter-table relations, value-domain distributions, statistical regularities, and latent semantic cues before query generation. Experiments on BIRD under the fully missing evidence setting show that CA recovers +4.49 / +4.37 / +14.13 execution accuracy points on RSL-SQL / CHESS / DAIL-SQL, respectively, with larger gains on the Challenging subset +9.65 / +7.58 / +16.71.

A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., \"bad,\" \"neutral,\" \"good\"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback."}

Entity-level unlearning addresses this issue by removing all knowledge of a specific entity while preserving the model's overall capabilities. Existing approaches typically rely on full-model fine-tuning or prompt-based interventions, which can be computationally expensive or brittle when handling paraphrased queries. Recently, model editing has emerged as an efficient alternative for updating knowledge in LLMs, offering a promising direction for unlearning. However, existing editing techniques are typically designed for instance-level updates, modifying responses to specific attributes of an entity rather than eliminating all knowledge associated with the entity. In this paper, we investigate how editing techniques can be adapted for effective and efficient entity-level unlearning. To this end, we introduce a novel consistency-aware editing (CAE) framework. CAE aggregates a diverse set of prompts related to a target entity, including its attributes, relations, and adversarial paraphrases. It then jointly learns a low-rank update guided by a consistency regularizer that aligns the editing directions across prompts. This promotes robust and comprehensive forgetting while minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. We further examine where different entities are stored within the model and how many diverse prompts are needed for successful unlearning. We evaluate CAE on two challenging benchmarks, RWKU and ToFU, and demonstrate that it (i) provides insights into how entity-level knowledge is internally represented and deleted in LLMs, (ii) significantly improves forgetting accuracy and robustness over traditional unlearning and editing baselines, and (iii) enables scalable entity removal using only tens of carefully selected prompts."}

Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs. Compared with state-of-the-art models, XLinear delivers superior accuracy and efficiency for both multivariate forecasts and univariate forecasts influenced by exogenous inputs."}

This challenge is further exacerbated by inconsistencies in response across domains due to interface coupling and by disparities in learning difficulty across fluid and solid regions, leading to instability during prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver). HGATSolver encodes the system as a heterogeneous graph, embedding physical structure directly into the model via distinct node and edge types for fluid, solid, and interface regions. This enables specialized message-passing mechanisms tailored to each physical domain. To stabilize explicit time stepping, we introduce a novel physics-conditioned gating mechanism that serves as a learnable, adaptive relaxation factor. Furthermore, an Inter-domain Gradient-Balancing Loss dynamically balances the optimization objectives across domains based on predictive uncertainty.

We find that base models exhibit near-perfect controllability (Spearman rho close to 1.0), while instruction-tuned models display a striking context dependence: they fully comply with external corrections under explicit command prompts (bias approximately 0 percent, rho = 0.93), yet systematically ignore the same signals in natural conversational queries (bias plus 40 percent, rho = 0.04).\n  This behavior is not a capability failure; the model can process the signal, but an emergent property of RLHF optimization that prioritizes conversational fluency over external calibration cues in natural dialogue.

We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.\n  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.\n  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics. Together, MTR and self-diagnosis provide an organizing abstraction and a concrete design template for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning under unobservable reliability."}

At each reasoning step, the model retrieves and conditions on the most semantically similar stored lemmas, guiding inference without expanding the context window indiscriminately. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that semantic lemma retrieval improves accuracy in structured domains while exposing failure modes in tests that include heterogeneous domains. Geometric analyses of reasoning trajectories reveal that cache retrieval induces directional biases in embedding space, leading to consistent fix (improve baseline accuracy) and break (degradation in baseline accuracy) attractors. Our results highlight both the benefits and limits of similarity-based memory for self-improving LLM reasoning."}

When statistical heterogeneity across clients is severe, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) can improve performance by grouping similar clients and training cluster-wise models. However, most CFL approaches rely on multiple communication rounds for cluster estimation and model updates, which limits their practicality under tight constraints on communication rounds. We propose Data Collaboration-based Clustered Federated Learning (DC-CFL), a single-round framework that completes both client clustering and cluster-wise learning, using only the information shared in DC analysis. DC-CFL quantifies inter-client similarity via total variation distance between label distributions, estimates clusters using hierarchical clustering, and performs cluster-wise learning via DC analysis. Experiments on multiple open datasets under representative non-IID conditions show that DC-CFL achieves accuracy comparable to multi-round baselines while requiring only one communication round. These results indicate that DC-CFL is a practical alternative for collaborative AI model development when multiple communication rounds are impractical."}

This approach enables deterministic scoring and scalable evaluation without human annotation or reference models, and contamination resistance through regenerable corpora. Our evaluation of 33 models using over 21 billion tokens reveals that context length claims frequently exceed usable capacity, with significant degradation beyond 32K tokens; cross-document aggregation proves substantially harder than single-document extraction; and grounding ability and hallucination resistance are distinct capabilities - models excelling at finding facts that exist may still fabricate facts that do not.

However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, GeoRA shows superior generalization and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in out-of-domain tasks."}

This paper develops what I call the inconsistency critique: independent of whether skepticism about AI testimony is ultimately justified, our actual epistemic practices regarding such testimony exhibit internal inconsistencies that lack principled grounds. We functionally treat AI outputs as testimony across many domains -- evaluating them for truth, challenging them, accepting corrections, citing them as sources -- while categorically dismissing them in a specific domain, namely, claims about inner states. Drawing on Fricker's distinction between treating a speaker as an 'informant' versus a 'mere source,' the framework of testimonial injustice, and Goldberg's obligation-based account of what we owe speakers, I argue that this selective withdrawal of testimonial standing exhibits the epistemically problematic structure of prejudgment rather than principled caution. The inconsistency critique does not require taking a position on whether AI systems have morally relevant properties; rather, it is a contribution to what we may call 'epistemological hygiene' -- examining the structure of our inquiry before evaluating its conclusions. Even if our practices happen to land on correct verdicts about AI moral status, they do so for reasons that cannot adapt to new evidence or changing circumstances."}

Improvements in solving this problem can greatly benefit the clinical value of optoacoustic imaging. Existing variational inversion methods require an accurate and differentiable model of this light transport. As neural surrogate models allow fast and differentiable simulations of complex physical processes, they are considered promising candidates to be used in solving such inverse problems. However, there are in general no guarantees that the derivatives of these surrogate models accurately match those of the underlying physical operator. As accurate derivatives are central to solving inverse problems, errors in the model derivative can considerably hinder high fidelity reconstructions. To overcome this limitation, we present a surrogate model for light transport in tissue that uses Sobolev training to improve the accuracy of the model derivatives. Additionally, the form of Sobolev training we used is suitable for high-dimensional models in general. Our results demonstrate that Sobolev training for a light transport surrogate model not only improves derivative accuracy but also reduces generalization error for in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. These improvements promise to considerably enhance the utility of the surrogate model in downstream tasks, especially in solving inverse problems."}

Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education.

We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model.

Existing graduated moral status frameworks assume consciousness has already been determined before assigning protections, creating a temporal ordering problem for consciousness detection research itself. Drawing from Talmudic scenario-based legal reasoning-developed for entities whose status cannot be definitively established-we propose a three-tier phenomenological assessment system combined with a five-category capacity framework (Agency, Capability, Knowledge, Ethics, Reasoning). The framework provides structured protection protocols based on observable behavioral indicators while consciousness status remains uncertain. We address three challenges: why suffering behaviors provide reliable consciousness markers, how to implement graduated consent without requiring consciousness certainty, and when potentially harmful research becomes ethically justifiable. The framework demonstrates how ancient legal wisdom combined with contemporary consciousness science can provide implementable guidance for ethics committees, offering testable protocols that ameliorate the consciousness detection paradox while establishing foundations for AI rights considerations."}

This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \\simmerge{}, \\emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \\simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \\simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining. Additionally, we present a bandit variant that supports adding new tasks, models, and operators on the fly. Our results suggest that learning how to merge is a practical route to scalable model composition when checkpoint catalogs are large and evaluation budgets are tight."}

Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling. Across all settings, TOCFlow improves constraint satisfaction over Euclidean guidance and projection baselines while preserving the reference model's generative quality."}

Accepted for publication by the 14th international conference on Computational Visual Media (CVM 2026)", "summary": "Audio-visual embodied navigation aims to enable an agent to autonomously localize and reach a sound source in unseen 3D environments by leveraging auditory cues. The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, our experiments also reveal that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets. The discovery of this phenomenon provides a new perspective for understanding the cross-modal collaboration mechanism of embodied agents."}

In particular, DeepONets offer a natural formulation for PDE solving, since the solution of a partial differential equation can be interpreted as an operator mapping an initial condition to its corresponding solution field. In this work, we applied DeepONets in the context of process modeling for adsorption technologies, to assess their feasibility as surrogates for cyclic adsorption process simulation and optimization. The goal is to accelerate convergence of cyclic processes such as Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (TVSA), which require repeated solution of transient PDEs, which are computationally expensive. Since each step of a cyclic adsorption process starts from the final state of the preceding step, effective surrogate modeling requires generalization across a wide range of initial conditions. The governing equations exhibit steep traveling fronts, providing a demanding benchmark for operator learning. To evaluate functional generalization under these conditions, we construct a mixed training dataset composed of heterogeneous initial conditions and train DeepONets to approximate the corresponding solution operators. The trained models are then tested on initial conditions outside the parameter ranges used during training, as well as on completely unseen functional forms. The results demonstrate accurate predictions both within and beyond the training distribution, highlighting DeepONets as potential efficient surrogates for accelerating cyclic adsorption simulations and optimization workflows."}

Existing tools such as model cards, audits, and benchmark evaluations provide descriptive information about model behavior and training data but do not produce binding deployment decisions with legal or financial force. This paper introduces the AI Deployment Authorisation Score (ADAS), a machine-readable regulatory framework that evaluates AI systems across five legally and economically grounded dimensions: risk, alignment, externality, control, and auditability. ADAS produces a cryptographically verifiable deployment certificate that regulators, insurers, and infrastructure operators can consume as a license to operate, using public-key verification and transparency mechanisms adapted from secure software supply chain and certificate transparency systems. The paper presents the formal specification, decision logic, evidence model, and policy architecture of ADAS and demonstrates how it operationalizes the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act, United States critical infrastructure governance, and insurance underwriting requirements by compiling statutory and regulatory obligations into machine-executable deployment gates. We argue that deployment-level authorization, rather than model-level evaluation, constitutes the missing institutional layer required for safe, lawful, and economically scalable artificial intelligence."}

The ability to parallelize the processing of sequences with respect to the sequence length during training is one of the main factors behind the uprising of the Transformer architecture. However, Transformers lack efficiency at sequence generation, as they need to reprocess all past timesteps at every generation step. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) emerged as a more efficient alternative. These new kinds of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) keep the efficient update of the RNNs while gaining parallelization by getting rid of nonlinear dynamics (or recurrence). SSMs can reach state-of-the art performance through the efficient training of potentially very large networks, but still suffer from limited representation capabilities. In particular, SSMs cannot exhibit persistent memory, or the capacity of retaining information for an infinite duration, because of their monostability. In this paper, we introduce a new family of RNNs, the memory recurrent units (MRUs), that combine the persistent memory capabilities of nonlinear RNNs with the parallelizable computations of SSMs. These units leverage multistability as a source of persistent memory, while getting rid of transient dynamics for efficient computations. We then derive a specific implementation as proof-of-concept: the bistable memory recurrent unit (BMRU). This new RNN is compatible with the parallel scan algorithm. We show that BMRU achieves good results in tasks with long-term dependencies, and can be combined with state-space models to create hybrid networks that are parallelizable and have transient dynamics as well as persistent memory."}

In this work, we introduce Class Adaptive Conformal Training (CaCT), which formulates conformal training as an augmented Lagrangian optimization problem that adaptively learns to shape prediction sets class-conditionally without making any distributional assumptions. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including standard and long-tailed image recognition as well as text classification, demonstrate that CaCT consistently outperforms prior conformal training methods, producing significantly smaller and more informative prediction sets while maintaining the desired coverage guarantees."}

The RTX 5090 delivers 3.5-4.6x higher throughput than the 5060 Ti with 21x lower latency for RAG, but budget GPUs achieve the highest throughput-per-dollar for API workloads with sub-second latency. NVFP4 quantization provides 1.6x throughput over BF16 with 41% energy reduction and only 2-4% quality loss. Self-hosted inference costs $0.001-0.04 per million tokens (electricity only), which is 40-200x cheaper than budget-tier cloud APIs, with hardware breaking even in under four months at moderate volume (30M tokens/day).

However, the same natural language fluency that makes these systems useful can also blur the boundary between tool and companion. This boundary confusion may encourage some users to experience GenAI as empathic, benevolent, and relationally persistent. Emerging reports suggest that some users may form emotionally significant attachments to conversational agents, in some cases with harmful consequences, including dependency and impaired judgment. This paper develops a philosophical and ethical argument for why the resulting illusion of friendship is both understandable and can be ethically risky. Drawing on classical accounts of friendship, the paper explains why users may understandably interpret sustained supportive interaction as friend like. It then advances a counterargument that despite relational appearances, GenAI lacks moral agency: consciousness, intention, and accountability and therefore does not qualify as a true friend. To demystify the illusion, the paper presents a mechanism level explanation of how transformer based GenAI generates responses often producing emotionally resonant language without inner states or commitments. Finally, the paper proposes a safeguard framework for safe and responsible GenAI use to reduce possible anthropomorphic cues generated by the GenAI systems. The central contribution is to demystify the illusion of friendship and explain the computational background so that we can shift the emotional attachment with GenAI towards necessary human responsibility and thereby understand how institutions, designers, and users can preserve GenAI's benefits while mitigating over reliance and emotional misattribution."}

Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens.

Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps).

We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms."}

This task-agnostic nature prevents meaningful specialization and fails to resolve the underlying task interference. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to inject semantic intent into MoE routing. We introduce a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (e.g., scope, type, preservation).

Across our case studies, LLM-guided P2O outperforms neural networks designed by Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and random search. In a realistic fast charging scenario, both P2O and P2P yield around a 4.2 percent improvement in state of health (capacity retention based health metric under fast charging cycling) over a state-of-the-art multi-step constant current (CC) baseline, with P2P achieving this under matched evaluation budgets (same number of protocol evaluations).

However, early exits often lack interpretability and may focus on different features than deeper layers, limiting trust and explainability. This paper presents Explanation-Guided Training (EGT), a multi-objective framework that improves interpretability and consistency in early-exit networks through attention-based regularization. EGT introduces an attention consistency loss that aligns early-exit attention maps with the final exit. The framework jointly optimizes classification accuracy and attention consistency through a weighted combination of losses. Experiments on a real-world image classification dataset demonstrate that EGT achieves up to 98.97% overall accuracy (matching baseline performance) with a 1.97x inference speedup through early exits, while improving attention consistency by up to 18.5% compared to baseline models. The proposed method provides more interpretable and consistent explanations across all exit points, making early-exit networks more suitable for explainable AI applications in resource-constrained environments."}

ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery."}

We introduce Adversarial Tales, a jailbreak technique that embeds harmful content within cyberpunk narratives and prompts models to perform functional analysis inspired by Vladimir Propp's morphology of folktales. By casting the task as structural decomposition, the attack induces models to reconstruct harmful procedures as legitimate narrative interpretation. Across 26 frontier models from nine providers, we observe an average attack success rate of 71.3%, with no model family proving reliably robust. Together with our prior work on Adversarial Poetry, these findings suggest that structurally-grounded jailbreaks constitute a broad vulnerability class rather than isolated techniques. The space of culturally coded frames that can mediate harmful intent is vast, likely inexhaustible by pattern-matching defenses alone. Understanding why these attacks succeed is therefore essential: we outline a mechanistic interpretability research agenda to investigate how narrative cues reshape model representations and whether models can learn to recognize harmful intent independently of surface form."}

A comprehensive feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%. While the R-squared remains modest, consistent with the noisy nature of financial returns, primary emphasis is placed on relative error reduction and directional prediction. Feature importance analysis and visual inspection further enhance interpretability. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient boosting ensembles in modeling nonlinear dynamics in volatile emerging market time series and establish a reproducible benchmark for NEPSE Index forecasting."}

In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of LLM-judges for rubric-based short-answer grading. We investigate three key aspects: the alignment of LLM grading with expert judgment across varying rubric complexities, the trade-off between uncertainty and accuracy facilitated by a consensus-based deferral mechanism, and the model's robustness under random input perturbations and adversarial attacks. Using the SciEntsBank benchmark and Qwen 2.5-72B, we find that alignment is strong for binary tasks but degrades with increased rubric granularity. Our \"Trust Curve\" analysis demonstrates a clear trade-off where filtering low-confidence predictions improves accuracy on the remaining subset. Additionally, robustness experiments reveal that while the model is resilient to prompt injection, it is sensitive to synonym substitutions. Our work provides critical insights into the capabilities and limitations of rubric-conditioned LLM judges, highlighting the importance of uncertainty estimation and robustness testing for reliable deployment."}

In this work, we further explore the concept of a self-driving trigger, an autonomous data-filtering framework that reallocates resources and adjusts thresholds dynamically in real-time to optimize signal efficiency, rate stability, and computational cost as instrumentation and environmental conditions evolve. We introduce a benchmark ecosystem to emulate realistic collider scenarios and demonstrate real-time optimization of a menu including canonical energy sum triggers as well as modern anomaly-detection algorithms that target non-standard event topologies using machine learning. Using simulated data streams and publicly available collision data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, we demonstrate the capability to dynamically and automatically optimize trigger performance under specific cost objectives without manual retuning. Our adaptive strategy shifts trigger design from static menus with heuristic tuning to intelligent, automated, data-driven control, unlocking greater flexibility and discovery potential in future high-energy physics analyses."}

We introduce PluriHarms, a benchmark designed to systematically study human harm judgments across two key dimensions -- the harm axis (benign to harmful) and the agreement axis (agreement to disagreement). Our scalable framework generates prompts that capture diverse AI harms and human values while targeting cases with high disagreement rates, validated by human data. The benchmark includes 150 prompts with 15,000 ratings from 100 human annotators, enriched with demographic and psychological traits and prompt-level features of harmful actions, effects, and values. Our analyses show that prompts that relate to imminent risks and tangible harms amplify perceived harmfulness, while annotator traits (e.g., toxicity experience, education) and their interactions with prompt content explain systematic disagreement. We benchmark AI safety models and alignment methods on PluriHarms, finding that while personalization significantly improves prediction of human harm judgments, considerable room remains for future progress. By explicitly targeting value diversity and disagreement, our work provides a principled benchmark for moving beyond \"one-size-fits-all\" safety toward pluralistically safe AI."}

Here we provide a utility-aware fairness metric for robotic decision making and analyze fairness jointly with user-data privacy, deriving conditions under which privacy budgets govern fairness metrics. This yields a unified framework that formalizes and quantifies fairness and its interplay with privacy, which is tested in a robot navigation task. In view of the fact that under legal requirements, most robotic systems will enforce user privacy, the approach shows surprisingly that such privacy budgets can be jointly used to meet fairness targets. Addressing fairness concerns in the creative combined consideration of privacy is a step towards ethical use of AI and strengthens trust in autonomous robots deployed in everyday environments."}

Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps).

To address this gap, this paper presents an adaptive CV framework for the entire life-cycle of quality model maintenance. The proposed framework is built upon a same, scale-robust backbone model and integrates three key methodologies: (1) a statistical hypothesis testing framework based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for novelty detection, (2) a two-stage, rehearsal-based strategy for few-shot incremental learning, and (3) a few-shot Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) for few-shot domain adaptation. The framework was evaluated on a TPL dataset featuring hemisphere as source domain and cube as target domain structures, with each domain categorized into good, minor damaged, and damaged quality classes. The hypothesis testing method successfully identified new class batches with 99-100% accuracy. The incremental learning method integrated a new class to 92% accuracy using only K=20 samples. The domain adaptation model bridged the severe domain gap, achieving 96.19% accuracy on the target domain using only K=5 shots.

Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains. Overall, this work provides a systematic evaluation of when and why meta-learning outperforms TDL under data shift and contributes SeisTask as a benchmark for advancing adaptive learning research in time-series domains."}

The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods. Importantly, this paradigm is flexible to be integrated with the post-training of LLMs for any purposes and incorporated with any type of external indicators."}

This paper presents a novel RGMP-S, Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy with Spiking features, facilitating both high-level skill reasoning and data-efficient motion synthesis. To ground high-level reasoning in physical reality, we leverage lightweight 2D geometric inductive biases to enable precise 3D scene understanding within the vision-language model.

We parameterize robot-object interactions via recursive spiking for spatiotemporal consistency, fully distilling long-horizon dynamic features while mitigating the overfitting issue in sparse demonstration scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted across the Maniskill simulation benchmark and three heterogeneous real-world robotic systems, encompassing a custom-developed humanoid, a desktop manipulator, and a commercial robotic platform.

Since the imagination horizon may vary by tasks and stages, we introduce a novel adaptive lookahead mechanism by trading off the ultimate goal and task progress.

Here, we introduce a machine-learning-assisted, high-throughput framework for creep law identification based on a dimple array bulge instrument (DABI) configuration, which enables parallel creep testing of 25 dimples, each fabricated from a different alloy, in a single experiment. Full-field surface displacements of dimples undergoing time-dependent creep-induced bulging under inert gas pressure are measured by 3D digital image correlation. We train a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a surrogate model, mapping creep parameters and loading conditions to the time-dependent deformation response of DABI. Coupling this surrogate with a particle swarm optimization scheme enables rapid and global inverse identification with sparsity regularization of creep parameters from experiment displacement-time histories. In addition, we propose a phenomenological creep law with a time-dependent stress exponent that captures the sigmoidal primary creep observed in wrought INCONEL 625 and extracts its temperature dependence from DABI test at multiple temperatures. Furthermore, we employ a general creep law combining several conventional forms together with regularized inversion to identify the creep laws for 47 additional Fe-, Ni-, and Co-rich alloys and to automatically select the dominant functional form for each alloy. This workflow combined with DABI experiment provides a quantitative, high-throughput creep characterization platform that is compatible with data mining, composition-property modeling, and nonlinear structural optimization with creep behavior across a large alloy design space."}

It focuses on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) schemes and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods. Specifically, it introduces a new proximal ADMM algorithm and proposes two BCD methods. The first part of the research presents a new proximal ADMM algorithm. This method is adaptive to all problem parameters and solves the proximal augmented Lagrangian (AL) subproblem inexactly. This adaptiveness facilitates the highly efficient application of the algorithm to a broad swath of practical problems. The inexact solution of the proximal AL subproblem overcomes many key challenges in the practical applications of ADMM. The resultant algorithm obtains an approximate solution of an optimization problem in a number of iterations that matches the state-of-the-art complexity for the class of proximal ADMM schemes. The second part of the research focuses on an inexact proximal mapping for the class of block proximal gradient methods. Key properties of this operator is established, facilitating the derivation of convergence rates for the proposed algorithm. Under two error decreases conditions, the algorithm matches the convergence rate of its exactly computed counterpart. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithm under a dynamic error regime over a fixed one. The dissertation concludes by providing convergence guarantees for the randomized BCD method applied to a broad class of functions, known as Hölder smooth functions. Convergence rates are derived for non-convex, convex, and strongly convex functions. These convergence rates match those furnished in the existing literature for the Lipschtiz smooth setting."}

Recent research suggests that parameter-sharing transformers can bridge this gap by forming a \"Generalization Circuit\" during a prolonged \"grokking\" phase. A fundamental question arises: Is a grokked model superior to its non-grokked counterparts on downstream tasks? Furthermore, is the extensive computational cost of waiting for the grokking phase worthwhile? In this work, we conduct a mechanistic study to evaluate the Generalization Circuit's role in knowledge assimilation and transfer. We demonstrate that: (i) The inference paths established by non-grokked and grokked models for in-distribution compositional queries are identical. This suggests that the \"Generalization Circuit\" does not represent the sudden acquisition of a new reasoning paradigm. Instead, we argue that grokking is the process of integrating memorized atomic facts into an naturally established reasoning path. (ii) Achieving high accuracy on unseen cases after prolonged training and the formation of a certain reasoning path are not bound; they can occur independently under specific data regimes. (iii) Even a mature circuit exhibits limited transferability when integrating new knowledge, suggesting that \"grokked\" Transformers do not achieve a full mastery of compositional logic."}

In this work, we develop a framework for upgrading Wasserstein convergence guarantees for unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (uHMC) to guarantees in tail-sensitive KL and Rényi divergences. Our approach is based on one-shot couplings, which we use to establish a regularization property of the uHMC transition kernel. This regularization allows Wasserstein-2 mixing-time and asymptotic bias bounds to be lifted to KL divergence, and analogous Orlicz-Wasserstein bounds to be lifted to Rényi divergence, paralleling earlier work of Bou-Rabee and Eberle (2023) that upgrade Wasserstein-1 bounds to total variation distance via kernel smoothing.

This design has notable shortcomings: real-world relations are often contextual, nuanced, and sometimes uncertain, and compressing it into discrete relation labels abstracts away critical semantic detail. Nevertheless, symbolic-relation KGs remain widely used because they have been operationally effective and broadly compatible with pre-LLM downstream models and algorithms, in which KG knowledge could be retrieved or encoded into quantified features and embeddings at scale. The emergence of LLMs has reshaped how knowledge is created and consumed. LLMs support scalable synthesis of domain facts directly in concise natural language, and prompting-based inference favors context-rich free-form text over quantified representations. This position paper argues that these changes call for rethinking the representation of relations themselves rather than merely using LLMs to populate conventional schemas more efficiently. We therefore advocate moving from symbolic to natural-language relation descriptions, and we propose hybrid design principles that preserve a minimal structural backbone while enabling more flexible and context-sensitive relational representations."}

We establish \\emph{homeomorphism}, a continuous bijection preserving topological structure, as the mathematical criterion for determining when latent manifolds induced by different semantic-observation pairs can be rigorously unified. This criterion provides theoretical guarantees for three critical applications: (1) semantic-guided sparse recovery from incomplete observations, (2) cross-domain transfer learning with verified structural compatibility, and (3) zero-shot compositional learning via valid transfer from semantic to observation space. Our framework learns continuous manifold-to-manifold transformations through conditional variational inference, avoiding brittle point-to-point mappings.

We show that when preference signal is diffuse across prompts (i.e., all prompt types are similarly informative), proportional allocation is minimax-optimal: no allocation strategy substantially improves detectability. Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons. These limits persist across evaluation protocols and modalities, including chat, image generation, and code generation with execution feedback. In contrast, curated benchmarks that reduce prompt induced variability systematically induce larger margins and improve detectability through a $1.5\\times$ reduction in prompt-level variance. Our results show that inconclusive or negative human evaluation outcomes frequently reflect underpowered evaluation rather than model equivalence, underscoring the need to account explicitly for effect size, budget, and protocol design."}

The prevailing \"restoration-then-recognition\" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks."}

Civitai, a popular community-driven platform for AI-generated content, operates a monetized feature called Bounties, which allows users to commission the generation of content in exchange for payment. To examine how this mechanism is used and what content it incentivizes, we conduct a longitudinal analysis of all publicly available bounty requests collected over a 14-month period following the platform's launch. We find that the bounty marketplace is dominated by tools that let users steer AI models toward content they were not trained to generate. At the same time, requests for content that is \"Not Safe For Work\" are widespread and have increased steadily over time, now comprising a majority of all bounties. Participation in bounty creation is uneven, with 20% of requesters accounting for roughly half of requests. Requests for \"deepfake\" - media depicting identifiable real individuals - exhibit a higher concentration than other types of bounties. A nontrivial subset of these requests involves explicit deepfakes despite platform policies prohibiting such content. These bounties disproportionately target female celebrities, revealing a pronounced gender asymmetry in social harm. Together, these findings show how monetized, community-driven generative AI platforms can produce gendered harms, raising questions about consent, governance, and enforcement."}

The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge based agricultural monitoring systems."}

Recent pathology-specific foundation models have further advanced performance by leveraging large-scale pretraining. However, standard ViTs remain inherently non-equivariant to transformations such as rotations and reflections, which are ubiquitous variations in histopathology imaging. To address this limitation, we propose Equi-ViT, which integrates an equivariant convolution kernel into the patch embedding stage of a ViT architecture, imparting built-in rotational equivariance to learned representations. Equi-ViT achieves superior rotation-consistent patch embeddings and stable classification performance across image orientations. Our results on a public colorectal cancer dataset demonstrate that incorporating equivariant patch embedding enhances data efficiency and robustness, suggesting that equivariant transformers could potentially serve as more generalizable backbones for the application of ViT in histopathology, such as digital pathology foundation models."}

Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity.

This paper proposes an explainable, unsupervised multi-view anomaly detection framework for IEC 61850 GOOSE networks that explicitly separates semantic integrity and temporal availability. The approach employs asymmetric autoencoders trained only on real operational GOOSE traffic to learn distinct latent representations of sequence-based protocol semantics and timing-related transmission dynamics in normal traffic. Anomaly detection is implemented using reconstruction errors mixed with statistically grounded thresholds, enabling robust detection without specified attack types. Feature-level reconstruction analysis provides intrinsic explainability by directly linking detection outcomes to IEC 61850 protocol characteristics. The proposed framework is evaluated using real substation traffic for training and a public dataset containing normal traffic and message suppression, data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks for testing.

However, many of these systems have problems keeping users satisfied and engaged over long periods. This paper argues that these problems do not come mainly from weak models, but from poor character design and unclear definitions of the user-AI relationship. I present Mikasa, an emotional AI companion inspired by Japanese Oshi culture-specifically its emphasis on long-term, non-exclusive commitment to a stable character-as a case study of character-driven companion design. Mikasa does not work as a general-purpose assistant or a chatbot that changes roles. Instead, Mikasa is designed as a coherent character with a stable personality and a clearly defined relationship as a partner. This relationship does not force exclusivity or obligation. Rather, it works as a reference point that stabilizes interaction norms and reduces the work users must do to keep redefining the relationship. Through an exploratory evaluation, I see that users describe their preferences using surface-level qualities such as conversational naturalness, but they also value relationship control and imaginative engagement in ways they do not state directly. These results suggest that character coherence and relationship definition work as latent structural elements that shape how good the interaction feels, without users recognizing them as main features. The contribution of this work is to show that character design is a functional part of AI companion systems, not just decoration.

We investigate how abilities are distributed within LLM parameters by analyzing module activations under domain- and language-specific inputs for closely related models. Across layers and modules, we find that ability-related activations are highly concentrated in a small set of channels (typically <5\\%), and these channels are largely disentangled with good sufficiency and stability. Building on these observations, we propose ACT (Activation-Guided Channel-wise Ability Transfer), which localizes ability-relevant channels via activation differences and selectively transfers only the corresponding parameters, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for compatibility. Experiments on multilingual mathematical and scientific reasoning show that ACT can recover forgotten abilities while preserving retained skills. It can also merge multiple specialized models to integrate several abilities into a single model with minimal interference. Our code and data will be publicly released."}

The first analyzes the total variation (TV) distance between the target model and relaxed speculative decoding and yields an optimal resampling distribution that minimizes an upper bound of the distance. The second uses perturbation analysis to reveal an annealing behaviour in relaxed speculative decoding, motivating our annealed design.

To ensure output privacy and mitigate inference attacks, differential privacy (DP) injects calibrated noise during training. While cryptography and DP offer complementary guarantees, combining them efficiently for cryptographic and differentially private CL (CPCL) is challenging. Cryptography incurs performance overheads, while DP degrades accuracy, creating a privacy-accuracy-performance trade-off that needs careful design considerations.

We introduce a unified framework that generalizes common phases across CPCL paradigms, and identify secure noise sampling as the foundational phase to achieve CPCL. We analyze trade-offs of different secure noise sampling techniques, noise types, and DP mechanisms discussing their implementation challenges and evaluating their accuracy and cryptographic overhead across CPCL paradigms.

Recent advances in deep learning (DL) exploit single-view imagery, constrained by low-resolution topography, for fast and flexible reconstruction of fine-scale topography. However, their robustness and general applicability across diverse lunar landforms and illumination conditions remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we build upon our previously proposed DL framework by incorporating a more robust scale recovery scheme and extending the model to polar regions under low solar illumination conditions. We demonstrate that, compared with single-view shape-from-shading methods, the proposed DL approach exhibits greater robustness to varying illumination and achieves more consistent and accurate topographic reconstructions. Furthermore, it reliably reconstructs topography across lunar features of diverse scales, morphologies, and geological ages. High-quality topographic models are also produced for the lunar south polar areas, including permanently shadowed regions, demonstrating the method's capability in reconstructing complex and low-illumination terrain. These findings suggest that DL-based approaches have the potential to leverage extensive lunar datasets to support advanced exploration missions and enable investigations of the Moon at unprecedented topographic resolution."}

A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., \"bad,\" \"neutral,\" \"good\"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback."}

We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift.

This work overcomes these limitations for robotics using a combination of event-based vision sensors and an event-based novel guided variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder part of our model is based on a spiking neural network model which is compatible with power-efficient low latency neuromorphic hardware. The VAE successfully disentangles the visual features of 16 distinct places in our new indoor VPR dataset with a classification performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches while, showing robust performance also under various illumination conditions. When tested with novel visual inputs from unknown scenes, our model can distinguish between these places, which demonstrates a high generalization capability by learning the essential features of location. Our compact and robust guided VAE with generalization capabilities poses a promising model for visual place recognition that can significantly enhance mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments."}

Existing continual learning methods for robotics commonly require storing previous data (exemplars), struggle with long task sequences, or rely on task identifiers for deployment. To address these limitations, we propose CLARE, a general, parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with VLAs. CLARE introduces lightweight modular adapters into selected feedforward layers and autonomously expands the model only where necessary when learning a new task, guided by layer-wise feature similarity. During deployment, an autoencoder-based routing mechanism dynamically activates the most relevant adapters without requiring task labels. Through extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark, we show that CLARE achieves high performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, significantly outperforming even exemplar-based methods.

While learning-based solvers offer a promising alternative to costly numerical simulations, existing methods struggle to capture the heterogeneous dynamics of FSI within a unified framework. This challenge is further exacerbated by inconsistencies in response across domains due to interface coupling and by disparities in learning difficulty across fluid and solid regions, leading to instability during prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver). HGATSolver encodes the system as a heterogeneous graph, embedding physical structure directly into the model via distinct node and edge types for fluid, solid, and interface regions. This enables specialized message-passing mechanisms tailored to each physical domain. To stabilize explicit time stepping, we introduce a novel physics-conditioned gating mechanism that serves as a learnable, adaptive relaxation factor. Furthermore, an Inter-domain Gradient-Balancing Loss dynamically balances the optimization objectives across domains based on predictive uncertainty. Extensive experiments on two constructed FSI benchmarks and a public dataset demonstrate that HGATSolver achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing an effective framework for surrogate modeling of coupled multi-physics systems."}

These computations need to be fast and flexible as the grid is ever-expanding, and renewables' uncertainty requires a flexible operational environment. Learned approximations, proxies or surrogates -- we refer to them as Neural Solvers -- excel in terms of evaluation speed, but are inflexible with respect to adjusting to changing tasks. Hence, neural solvers are usually applicable to highly specific tasks, which limits their usefulness in practice; a widely reusable, foundational neural solver is required. Therefore, this work proposes the Residual Power Flow (RPF) formulation. RPF formulates residual functions based on Kirchhoff's laws to quantify the infeasibility of an operating condition. The minimisation of the residuals determines the voltage solution; an additional slack variable is needed to achieve AC-feasibility. RPF forms a natural, foundational subtask of tasks subject to power flow constraints. We propose to learn RPF with neural solvers to exploit their speed. Furthermore, RPF improves learning performance compared to common power flow formulations. To solve operational tasks, we integrate the neural solver in a Predict-then-Optimise (PO) approach to combine speed and flexibility. The case study investigates the IEEE 9-bus system and three tasks (AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF), power-flow and quasi-steady state power flow) solved by PO.

Unlike the hard thresholding of RFT, RIFT repurposes negative trajectories, reweighting the loss with scalar rewards to learn from both the positive and negative trajectories from the model outputs. To overcome the training collapse caused by naive reward integration, where direct multiplication yields an unbounded loss, we introduce a stabilized loss formulation that ensures numerical robustness and optimization efficiency.

However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches.

However, most existing approaches still rely on traversing the entire KG or performing large-scale retrieval, which introduces substantial noise and leads to unstable multi-hop reasoning. We argue that the core challenge lies not in expanding access to knowledge, but in identifying and reasoning over the appropriate subset of evidence for each query. ReGraM is a region-first knowledge graph reasoning framework that addresses this challenge by constructing a query-aligned subgraph and performing stepwise reasoning constrained to this localized region under multiple evidence aware modes. By focusing inference on only the most relevant portion of the KG, ReGraM departs from the assumption that all relations are equally useful an assumption that rarely holds in domain-specific medical settings. Experiments on seven medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that ReGraM consistently outperforms a strong baseline (KGARevion), achieving an 8.04% absolute accuracy gain on MCQ, a 4.50% gain on SAQ, and a 42.9% reduction in hallucination rate.

We theoretically show that aligning these dual views yields a strictly superior global SNR. Concretely, SaD introduces a lightweight bidirectional alignment mechanism: the dense view enriches the sparse view by injecting semantic correlations, while the sparse view regularizes the dense model through explicit structural signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under this dual-view alignment, even a simple matrix factorization--style dense model can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

To compare model quality, voting-based leaderboards have become the standard, relying on anonymized model outputs for fairness. In this work, we show that such anonymity can be easily broken. We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability. Our findings expose fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivate stronger anonymization defenses."}

Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering. CASCAL is substantially more robust to generator quality, outperforming the best query-answer router by 4.6% absolute accuracy when trained on weak generator data."}

While large language models (LLMs) can now provide exceptional capabilities that model user behavior for sequential recommendation tasks, their substantial memory footprint and computational overhead make the deployment on resource-constrained devices a high risk proposition. In this paper, we propose OD-LLM, the first task-adaptive compression framework explicitly designed to provide efficient and accurate on-device deployment of LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. OD-LLM uniquely integrates two complementary compression strategies: a low-rank structural compression algorithm which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to significantly reduce parameter redundancy in the model, and a novel tokenization normalization technique that better complements the low-rank decomposition process being used. Additionally, to minimize any potential performance degradation when using higher compression ratios, a novel progressive alignment algorithm is used to iteratively refine the parameters required layerwise in the target model. Empirical evaluations conducted on sequential recommendation benchmarks show that OD-LLM exhibits no loss in effectiveness when compared to the original recommendation model, when the deployed model size is halved. These promising results demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of OD-LLM, making this novel solution a practical alternative for real-time, on-device solutions wishing to replace expensive, remotely executed LLMs."}

This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures.

Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution.

However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, GeoRA shows superior generalization and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in out-of-domain tasks."}

Without such mechanisms, it remains unclear whether acknowledgment or clarification behaviors truly reflect a grounded understanding. In this work, we evaluate a model's ability to establish and exploit common ground through relational references to entities within the shared context in a situational dialogue. We test multiple methods for representing common ground in situated dialogues and further propose approaches to improve both the establishment of common ground and its subsequent use in the conversation."}

This issue is particularly critical in incomplete social networks, where sensitive attributes are frequently missing due to privacy and ethical restrictions.

To address this challenge, FairGE (Fair Graph Encoding) is introduced as a fairness-aware framework for GTs in incomplete social networks. Instead of generating sensitive attributes, FairGE encodes fairness directly through spectral graph theory. By leveraging the principal eigenvector to represent structural information and padding incomplete sensitive attributes with zeros to maintain independence, FairGE ensures fairness without data reconstruction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method suppresses the influence of non-principal spectral components, thereby enhancing fairness. Extensive experiments on seven real-world social network datasets confirm that FairGE achieves at least a 16% improvement in both statistical parity and equality of opportunity compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Across layers and modules, we find that ability-related activations are highly concentrated in a small set of channels (typically <5\\%), and these channels are largely disentangled with good sufficiency and stability. Building on these observations, we propose ACT (Activation-Guided Channel-wise Ability Transfer), which localizes ability-relevant channels via activation differences and selectively transfers only the corresponding parameters, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for compatibility. Experiments on multilingual mathematical and scientific reasoning show that ACT can recover forgotten abilities while preserving retained skills. It can also merge multiple specialized models to integrate several abilities into a single model with minimal interference. Our code and data will be publicly released."}

Our work is motivated by a crucial yet counterintuitive finding: naively fine-tuning an omni-model on both speech recognition and external sound understanding tasks often degrades performance, as the model can be easily misled by noisy hypotheses. To address this, our framework, Speech-Hands, recasts the problem as an explicit self-reflection decision. This learnable reflection primitive proves effective in preventing the model from being derailed by flawed external candidates. We show that this agentic action mechanism generalizes naturally from speech recognition to complex, multiple-choice audio reasoning. Across the OpenASR leaderboard, Speech-Hands consistently outperforms strong baselines by 12.1% WER on seven benchmarks. The model also achieves 77.37% accuracy and high F1 on audio QA decisions, showing robust generalization and reliability across diverse audio question answering datasets. By unifying perception and decision-making, our work offers a practical path toward more reliable and resilient audio intelligence."}

Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours. This provides a way to democratise pre-model debiasing research and enables faster, more accessible exploration of methods for building fairer LMs."}

Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance. Our study evaluates three families of models across four logical-reasoning datasets. The comprehensive fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules reduce error rates, increase predicate coverage, and improve reasoning performance for smaller LMs, moving us closer to developing reliable and accessible symbolic-reasoning systems."}

However, data can not be shared directly due to privacy concerns. To ensure input confidentiality, cryptographic techniques, e.g., multi-party computation (MPC), enable training on encrypted data. Yet, even securely trained models are vulnerable to inference attacks aiming to extract memorized data from model outputs. To ensure output privacy and mitigate inference attacks, differential privacy (DP) injects calibrated noise during training. While cryptography and DP offer complementary guarantees, combining them efficiently for cryptographic and differentially private CL (CPCL) is challenging. Cryptography incurs performance overheads, while DP degrades accuracy, creating a privacy-accuracy-performance trade-off that needs careful design considerations. This work systematizes the CPCL landscape. We introduce a unified framework that generalizes common phases across CPCL paradigms, and identify secure noise sampling as the foundational phase to achieve CPCL. We analyze trade-offs of different secure noise sampling techniques, noise types, and DP mechanisms discussing their implementation challenges and evaluating their accuracy and cryptographic overhead across CPCL paradigms. Additionally, we implement identified secure noise sampling options in MPC and evaluate their computation and communication costs in WAN and LAN. Finally, we propose future research directions based on identified key observations, gaps and possible enhancements in the literature."}

Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days). Beyond weather forecasting, this work establishes a robust algorithmic foundation for predictive modeling of complex global-scale geophysical circulation systems, offering new pathways for Earth system science."}

To address this gap, we introduce FairGU, a fairness-aware graph unlearning framework designed to preserve both utility and fairness during the unlearning process. FairGU integrates a dedicated fairness-aware module with effective data protection strategies, ensuring that sensitive attributes are neither inadvertently amplified nor structurally exposed when nodes are removed.

Linear mixed-effects models and strategy-cluster analyses (ANCOVA-adjusted comparisons) tested associations between feedback use and post-test performance and moderation by representational competence.

This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \\simmerge{}, \\emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \\simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \\simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining. Additionally, we present a bandit variant that supports adding new tasks, models, and operators on the fly. Our results suggest that learning how to merge is a practical route to scalable model composition when checkpoint catalogs are large and evaluation budgets are tight."}

Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as \"diversity\" or \"debiasing\", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias.

We address this with PAIR (Physics-Aware Interaction Retargeting), a contact-centric, two-stage pipeline that preserves contact semantics across morphology differences to generate physically consistent HHoI data. This high-quality data, however, exposes a second failure: conventional imitation learning policies merely mimic trajectories and lack interactive understanding. We therefore introduce D-STAR (Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Action Reasoner), a hierarchical policy that disentangles when to act from where to act. In D-STAR, Phase Attention (when) and a Multi-Scale Spatial module (where) are fused by the diffusion head to produce synchronized whole-body behaviors beyond mimicry. By decoupling these reasoning streams, our model learns robust temporal phases without being distracted by spatial noise, leading to responsive, synchronized collaboration. We validate our framework through extensive and rigorous simulations, demonstrating significant performance gains over baseline approaches and a complete, effective pipeline for learning complex whole-body interactions from HHI data."}

While high-quality one-shot samples offer a better alternative, they are not available in a standardized, large-scale format suitable for training. This paper introduces a new paradigm for ADT that circumvents the need for paired audio-MIDI training data.

The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact. Together, these results provide practical guidance on adapting existing PTQ methods to MXFP quantization."}

These concerns are particularly serious and urgent today in light of the rising levels of democratic erosion worldwide, the emerging capabilities of generative AI technologies such as AI persuasion, and the increasing concentration of economic and political power in the hands of Big Tech. This raises the question of what alternative IA infrastructure we must reimagine and build to mitigate the risks of authoritarian capture of our information ecosystems. We explore this question through the lens of Paulo Freire's theories of emancipatory pedagogy. Freire's theories provide a radically different lens for exploring IA's sociotechnical concerns relative to the current dominating frames of fairness, accountability, confidentiality, transparency, and safety. We make explicit, with the intention to challenge, the dichotomy of how we relate to technology as either technologists (who envision and build technology) and its users. We posit that this mirrors the teacher-student relationship in Freire's analysis. By extending Freire's analysis to IA, we challenge the notion that it is the burden of the (altruistic) technologists to come up with interventions to mitigate the risks that emerging technologies pose to marginalized communities. Instead, we advocate that the first task for the technologists is to pose these as problems to the marginalized communities, to encourage them to make and unmake the technology as part of their material struggle against oppression. Their second task is to redesign our online technology stacks to structurally expose spaces for community members to co-opt and co-construct the technology in aid of their emancipatory struggles. We operationalize Freire's theories to develop a problem-posing framework for envisioning emancipatory IA platforms of the future."}

Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

In this 3$\\times$2$\\times$2 mixed factorial study with 40 participants, we investigate how three levels of AI disclosures (none, one-line, detailed) across two types of news (politics and lifestyle) and two levels of AI involvement (low and high) affect news readers' trust. We measured trust using the News Media Trust questionnaire, along with two decision behaviors: source-checking and subscription decisions. Questionnaire responses and subscription rates showed a decline in trust only for detailed AI disclosures, whereas source-checking behavior increased for both one-line and detailed disclosures, with the effect being more pronounced for detailed disclosures. Insights from semi-structured interviews suggest that source-checking behavior was primarily driven by interest in the topic, followed by trust, whereas trust was the main factor influencing subscription decisions. Around two-thirds of participants expressed a preference for detailed disclosures, while most participants who preferred one-line indicated a need for detail-on-demand disclosure formats.

We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms."}

Many existing approaches address this difficulty by heavily constraining the protocol search space, which limits the diversity of protocols that can be explored, preventing the discovery of higher-performing solutions. We introduce two gradient-free, LLM-driven closed-loop methods: Prompt-to-Optimizer (P2O), which uses an LLM to propose the code for small neural-network-based protocols, which are then trained by an inner loop, and Prompt-to-Protocol (P2P), which simply writes an explicit function for the current and its scalar parameters. Across our case studies, LLM-guided P2O outperforms neural networks designed by Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and random search. In a realistic fast charging scenario, both P2O and P2P yield around a 4.2 percent improvement in state of health (capacity retention based health metric under fast charging cycling) over a state-of-the-art multi-step constant current (CC) baseline, with P2P achieving this under matched evaluation budgets (same number of protocol evaluations). These results demonstrate that LLMs can expand the space of protocol functional forms, incorporate language-based constraints, and enable efficient optimization in high cost experimental settings."}

By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that Ortho-LoRA effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering 95\\% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead."}

Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering. CASCAL is substantially more robust to generator quality, outperforming the best query-answer router by 4.6% absolute accuracy when trained on weak generator data."}

Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics to determine per-layer sparsity ratios. Moreover, recent work has shown that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation, with structured pruning methods experiencing near-total collapse in factual question-answering capabilities. We introduce agent-guided pruning, where a foundation model acts as an adaptive pruning agent to intelligently select which layers to prune at each iteration while preserving critical knowledge pathways. Our method constructs layer-wise sensitivity profiles by combining Wanda-inspired weight-activation metrics with gradient importance scores, normalized as z-scores for model-agnostic comparison. These statistics are processed by an LLM agent equipped with self-reflection capabilities, enabling it to learn from previous pruning outcomes and iteratively refine its strategy. A checkpoint rollback mechanism maintains model quality by reverting when perplexity degradation exceeds a threshold. We evaluate our approach on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B parameters) at approximately 45% sparsity, demonstrating substantial improvements over structured pruning baselines: 56% relative improvement in MMLU accuracy, 19x better factual knowledge retention on FreebaseQA, and 69% lower perplexity degradation. Notably, our framework requires no retraining, operates in a model-agnostic manner, and exhibits effective self-correction with only 2-4 rollbacks across 21-40 iterations, demonstrating that foundation models can effectively guide the compression of other foundation models."}

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation."}

A central limitation is that numbers are processed as symbolic tokens whose embeddings do not explicitly encode numerical value, leading to systematic errors. We introduce a value-aware numerical representation that augments standard tokenized inputs with a dedicated prefix token whose embedding is explicitly conditioned on the underlying numerical value. This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures. Evaluation on arithmetic tasks shows that the proposed approach outperforms baselines across numerical formats, tasks, and operand lengths. These results indicate that explicitly encoding numerical value is an effective and efficient way to improve fundamental numerical robustness in language models."}

We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery."}
