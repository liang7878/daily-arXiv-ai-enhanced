The primary goal is to identify and mitigate\npotential sampling biases attributed to orbit selection during pre-Phase A\nmission studies. This methodology supports current incubation activities for a\nfuture Planetary Boundary Layer observing system by incorporating a sampling\neffectiveness measure into a broader architectural study. The study evaluates\nthe effectiveness of 20 satellite configurations for observing convective storm\nactivity in the Southwestern U.S. during the North American Monsoon (NAM)\nseason. The primary design variables are the number of satellites, orbit type\n(sun-synchronous or inclined), and Local Time of Ascending Node (LTAN). Using\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to assess observational representativeness and\nKernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate probability density functions, the\nstudy quantifies the discrepancy between observed and ground truth storm\nfeatures. Results indicate that a two-satellite sun-synchronous system with an\n8:00 PM LTAN, achieved the lowest KL divergence, signifying the most\nrepresentative observation of storm clusters. In contrast, single-satellite\nconfigurations, particularly those with late-night LTANs (e.g., 12:00 AM),\ndemonstrated significantly higher KL divergence. The study concludes that\ndual-satellite configurations in sun-synchronous orbits with evening LTANs\noutperform single-satellite and inclined configurations in capturing\nrepresentative convective storm activity.

Second, we deploy the framework on a\nlarge-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,\ncollecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case\nstudies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,\nplanning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction\nrates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how\nour framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing\nconfidence intervals by 40\\% compared to a standard A/B test.

The\nintractable discrete states present in most biochemical processes render the\ndirect simulation of the CME infeasible.

Additional experiments on the\nsurface of a cylinder further illustrate the generality of the approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u6761\u63d2\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0e\u514b\u91cc\u91d1\u6cd5\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5143\u8fd1\u4f3c\u968f\u673a\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6837\u6761\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u57df\u6216\u7403\u4f53\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u6837\u6761\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6837\u6761\u63d2\u503c\u4e0e\u514b\u91cc\u91d1\u6cd5\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u968f\u673a\u573a\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5143\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u968f\u673a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e09\u89d2\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af - \u8d1d\u5c14\u7279\u62c9\u7c73\u7b97\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7403\u4f53\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7403\u8c10\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5728\u5706\u67f1\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u6761\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u53ef\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u573a\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Using a\ndistrict-level panel dataset for the years 2010-2021, we employ a two-stage\nleast squares (2SLS) instrumental variable strategy. Plausibly exogenous\nvariation in annual rainfall is used to instrument for a satellite-derived\nmeasure of vegetation health and agricultural productivity, the Normalized\nDifference Vegetation Index (NDVI), allowing for a causal interpretation of the\nresults. For primary education, where direct costs are low, enrollment is\ncountercyclical: positive productivity shocks are associated with lower\nenrollment. Notably, boys' primary enrollment is found to be significantly more\nelastic to these shocks than girls' enrollment.

Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes,\nachieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents\nbackward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally\nchallenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two\nvariational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model.\nIn this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural\nnetwork-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly\nutilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the\nupstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis\nand reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for\nthe upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional\nvariational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional\ncut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all\nthe upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut\nestimate to approximate any cut-posterior.

It plays a crucial role in determining the\nfinal exposure, directly influencing user experience. Recently, generative\nreranking has gained increasing attention for its strong ability to model\ncomplex dependencies among items. However, most existing methods suffer from\nthe \"likelihood trap\", where high-likelihood sequences are often perceived as\nlow-quality by humans. These models tend to repeatedly recommend a set of\nhigh-frequency items, resulting in list homogeneity, thereby limiting user\nengagement. In this work, we propose Consistent Graph-structured Generative\nRecommendation (Congrats), a novel generative reranking framework. To break the\nlikelihood trap, we introduce a novel graph-structured decoder that can capture\ndiverse sequences along multiple paths. This design not only expands the\ndecoding space to promote diversity, but also improves prediction accuracy by\nimplicit item dependencies derived from vertex transitions. Furthermore, we\ndesign a differentiable cascade system that incorporates an evaluator, enabling\nthe model to learn directly from user preferences as the training objective.\nExtensive offline experiments validate the superior performance of Congrats\nover state-of-the-art reranking methods.

Experiments show that AQORA reduces end-to-end execution time by\nup to 90% compared to other learned methods and by up to 70% compared to Spark\nSQL's default configuration with adaptive query execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408LQO\u548cAQP\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u5668AQORA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\uff08LQO\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\uff08AQP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982LQO\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001AQP\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u5668AQORA\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u73b0\u5b9e\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u9636\u6bb5\u7ea7\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u96c6\u6210\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cAQORA\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1190%\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u4e0eSpark SQL\u9ed8\u8ba4\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1170%\u3002", "conclusion": "AQORA\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LQO\u548cAQP\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Using high-resolution GPS data from 2,415 residents\nin the Paris region, we assess how SPA influences total travel time and leisure\nparticipation, measured as the diversity of leisure activity locations.

Motivated by such scenarios, we introduce\ntemporal cooperative games (TCG), where the worth $v$ becomes a function of the\nsequence of agents $\\pi$ rather than just the set $S$. This shift calls for\nrethinking the underlying axioms. A key property in this temporal framework is\nthe incentive for optimal arrival (I4OA), which encourages agents to join in\nthe order maximizing total worth. Alongside, we define two additional\nproperties: online individual rationality (OIR), incentivizing earlier agents\nto invite more participants, and sequential efficiency (SE), ensuring that the\ntotal worth of any sequence is fully distributed among its agents. We identify\na class of reward-sharing mechanisms uniquely characterized by these three\nproperties. The classical Shapley value does not directly apply here, so we\nconstruct its natural analogs in two variants: the sequential world, where\nrewards are defined for each sequence-player pair, and the extended world,\nwhere rewards are defined for each player alone. Properties of efficiency,\nadditivity, and null player uniquely determine these Shapley analogs in both\nworlds. Importantly, the Shapley analogs are disjoint from mechanisms\nsatisfying I4OA, OIR, and SE, and this conflict persists even for restricted\nclasses such as convex and simple TCGs. Our findings thus uncover a fundamental\ntension: when players arrive sequentially, reward-sharing mechanisms satisfying\ndesirable temporal properties must inherently differ from Shapley-inspired\nones, opening new questions for defining fair and efficient solution concepts\nin TCGs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\uff08TCG\uff09\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6784\u5efaShapley\u503c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4e0eShapley\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u8054\u76df\u4ef7\u503c\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e3b\u4f53\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e3b\u4f53\u5230\u8fbe\u987a\u5e8f\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f15\u5165TCG\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49I4OA\u3001OIR\u548cSE\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u4e16\u754c\u7684Shapley\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u7531\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u552f\u4e00\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u7c7b\uff0cShapley\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u4e0e\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73a9\u5bb6\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u7406\u60f3\u65f6\u95f4\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u4e0eShapley\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6839\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e3aTCG\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\u516c\u5e73\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing evaluations\ntypically measure resistance to deobfuscation, leaving the critical question of\nwhether obfuscators preserve program semantics unanswered. Incorrect\ntransformations can silently alter functionality, compromise reliability, and\nerode security-undermining the very purpose of obfuscation. To address this\ngap, we present OBsmith, a novel framework to systematically test JavaScript\nobfuscators using large language models (LLMs). OBsmith leverages LLMs to\ngenerate program sketches abstract templates capturing diverse language\nconstructs, idioms, and corner cases-which are instantiated into executable\nprograms and subjected to obfuscation under different configurations. Besides\nLLM-powered sketching, OBsmith also employs a second source: automatic\nextraction of sketches from real programs. This extraction path enables more\nfocused testing of project specific features and lets developers inject domain\nknowledge into the resulting test cases. OBsmith uncovers 11 previously unknown\ncorrectness bugs. Under an equal program budget, five general purpose\nstate-of-the-art JavaScript fuzzers (FuzzJIT, Jsfunfuzz, Superion, DIE,\nFuzzilli) failed to detect these issues, highlighting OBsmith's complementary\nfocus on obfuscation induced misbehavior.

To\novercome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.\nTreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space\nwhile keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three\nkey designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion\nstrategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,\nreducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space\ndenoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with\nlightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and\nstructural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term\nrewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and\nremoving the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D\nmolecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional\nsettings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.\nNotably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to\nimprove with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods\nplateau early under limited resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTreeDiff\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u63a7\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8fbeSOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u671f\u671b\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTreeDiff\uff0c\u4e00\u79cdMCTS\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5b8f\u89c2\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u53cc\u7a7a\u95f4\u53bb\u566a\u673a\u5236\u548c\u53cc\u7a7a\u95f4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u548c3D\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTreeDiff\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "TreeDiff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

However,\nthey still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic\nextraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making\nthe learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the\nheterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging\nmodality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel\nsemantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,\ndubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a\nnew textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,\ndepicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a\ncross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal\nsemantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a\nwell-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space\ncan be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of\ncross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic\nsimilarities between image and text modality.

However, transferring from poorly aligned data can harm\nrather than help performance, making it crucial to determine whether the\ntransfer will be beneficial before implementation. This work aims to address\nthis challenge by proposing an innovative metric to measure dataset similarity\nand provide quantitative guidance on transferability. In the literature,\nexisting methods largely focus on feature distributions while overlooking label\ninformation and predictive relationships, potentially missing critical\ntransferability insights. In contrast, our proposed metric, the Cross-Learning\nScore (CLS), measures dataset similarity through bidirectional generalization\nperformance between domains. We provide a theoretical justification for CLS by\nestablishing its connection to the cosine similarity between the decision\nboundaries for the target and source datasets. Computationally, CLS is\nefficient and fast to compute as it bypasses the problem of expensive\ndistribution estimation for high-dimensional problems.

While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by\nreusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by\ndisaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be\nrealized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM\ninference engines and queries.\n  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV\ncaching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM\nengines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.\nLMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming\nLLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV\ncache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both\ncache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode\ndisaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and\nwide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache\ndata movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement\noperations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,\ndecoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class\ncontrol API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for\nflexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.\nEvaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x\nimprovement in throughput across diverse workloads.

This paper presents\nAEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration\nfor machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We\nintroduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a\nmetric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after\nmasking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)\nor none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable\nfor scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions.

Historical interaction sequences\noften contain irrelevant noisy items, which significantly hinders the\nperformance of recommendation systems. Existing research employs unsupervised\nmethods that indirectly identify item-granularity irrelevant noise by\npredicting the ground truth item. Since these methods lack explicit noise\nlabels, they are prone to misidentify users' interested items as noise.\nAdditionally, while these methods focus on removing item-granularity noise\ndriven by the ground truth item, they overlook interest-granularity noise,\nlimiting their ability to perform broader denoising based on user interests. To\naddress these issues, we propose Multi-Granularity Sequence Denoising with\nWeakly Supervised Signal for Sequential Recommendation(MGSD-WSS). MGSD-WSS\nfirst introduces the Multiple Gaussian Kernel Perceptron module to map the\noriginal and enhance sequence into a common representation space and utilizes\nweakly supervised signals to accurately identify noisy items in the historical\ninteraction sequence. Subsequently, it employs the item-granularity denoising\nmodule with noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain denoised item\nrepresentations. Then, it extracts target interest representations from the\nground truth item and applies noise-weighted contrastive learning to obtain\ndenoised interest representations.

By\nreducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,\nexisting methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,\nfundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure\ndistribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem.

CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool\nof counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,\nand applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify\nmechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA\nbenchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower\ncost than strong baselines.

But real life also pushes human intelligence along a\ndifferent frontier, requiring people to flexibly navigate decision-making\nproblems that they have never thought about before. Here, we use novice\ngameplay to study how people make decisions and form judgments in new problem\nsettings. We show that people are systematic and adaptively rational in how\nthey play a game for the first time, or evaluate a game (e.g., how fair or how\nfun it is likely to be) before they have played it even once. We explain these\ncapacities via a computational cognitive model that we call the \"Intuitive\nGamer\". The model is based on mechanisms of fast and flat (depth-limited)\ngoal-directed probabilistic simulation--analogous to those used in Monte Carlo\ntree-search models of expert game-play, but scaled down to use very few\nstochastic samples, simple goal heuristics for evaluating actions, and no deep\nsearch. In a series of large-scale behavioral studies with over 1000\nparticipants and 121 two-player strategic board games (almost all novel to our\nparticipants), our model quantitatively captures human judgments and decisions\nvarying the amount and kind of experience people have with a game--from no\nexperience at all (\"just thinking\"), to a single round of play, to indirect\nexperience watching another person and predicting how they should play--and\ndoes so significantly better than much more compute-intensive expert-level\nmodels. More broadly, our work offers new insights into how people rapidly\nevaluate, act, and make suggestions when encountering novel problems, and could\ninform the design of more flexible and human-like AI systems that can determine\nnot just how to solve new tasks, but whether a task is worth thinking about at\nall.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u65b0\u624b\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u76f4\u89c9\u73a9\u5bb6\u201d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7c7b\u4ebaAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u751f\u6d3b\u8981\u6c42\u4eba\u4eec\u7075\u6d3b\u5e94\u5bf9\u4ece\u672a\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u6216\u8d85\u4eba\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7528\u65b0\u624b\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u6241\u5e73\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u62df\u673a\u5236\u7684\u201c\u76f4\u89c9\u73a9\u5bb6\u201d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d851000\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c121\u79cd\u53cc\u4eba\u6218\u7565\u68cb\u76d8\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5b9a\u91cf\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u6e38\u620f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0b\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4eba\u4eec\u9047\u5230\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u548c\u5efa\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7c7b\u4ebaAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

An important step in\ncapacity management is predicting future resource needs often relies on\ndata-driven analytics and machine learning (ML) forecasting models, which\nrequire frequent retraining to stay relevant as data evolves. Continuously\nretraining the forecasting models can be expensive and difficult to scale,\nposing a challenge for engineering teams tasked with balancing accuracy and\nefficiency. Retraining only when the data changes appears to be a more\ncomputationally efficient alternative, but its impact on accuracy requires\nfurther investigation. In this work, we investigate the effects of retraining\ncapacity forecasting models for time series based on detected changes in the\ndata compared to periodic retraining. Our results show that drift-based\nretraining achieves comparable forecasting accuracy to periodic retraining in\nmost cases, making it a cost-effective strategy.

Diagnosing Language Bias in LLM-based Recommenders", "categories": ["cs.IR"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs), owing to their extensive open-domain knowledge\nand semantic reasoning capabilities, have been increasingly integrated into\nrecommender systems (RS). However, a substantial gap remains between the\npre-training objectives of LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation\ntasks. To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed\non specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their\npredictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it\ninduces Language Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens-such\nas task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens-while underutilizing core user\ninteraction tokens that encode user-specific preferences. This bias not only\nundermines recommendation accuracy but also raises unfairness concerns.\n  To address this issue, we propose Group Distributionally Robust\nOptimization-based Tuning (GDRT), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that enforces\nconsistent model performance across token groups with varying degrees of\nrelevance to auxiliary tokens. By adaptively upweighting underperforming\ngroups, typically those weakly correlated with auxiliary tokens, GDRT shifts\nthe model's attention from superficial auxiliary cues to informative user\ninteraction tokens, thereby mitigating language bias.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel framework called \\emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion\nposterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or\nlikelihood approximation.

This enables low-latency\nhigh-throughput networking, as required for many modern data centres, HPC\napplications and AI/ML workloads. However, baseline RDMA comprises a highly\npermissive weak memory model that is difficult to use in practice and has only\nrecently been formalised. In this paper, we introduce the Library of Composable\nObjects (LOCO), a formally verified library for building multi-node objects on\nRDMA, filling the gap between shared memory and distributed system programming.\nLOCO objects are well-encapsulated and take advantage of the strong locality\nand the weak consistency characteristics of RDMA.

Existing selective\nconformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by\nconstructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct\nanswers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers\nfor all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA\nscenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we\nintroduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware\nsampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out\ncalibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling\ncap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,\nthe maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level\ncannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated\nsampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ\ncalibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated\nbudget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically\nvalid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the\ncandidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an\nadditional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby\ncontrolling the risk of correct answers being excluded.

Across tasks, PINNs\nare the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers\nthe best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more\nsensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used\neffectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,\nnetwork width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most\ngains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs.

Compared to rule-based translation which produces Rust code that\nremains largely unsafe, LLM-based methods can generate more idiomatic and safer\nRust code because LLMs have been trained on vast amount of human-written\nidiomatic code.

In \\ourtool{}, the \\kg{} provides LLMs with\ncomprehensive pointer semantics from a global perspective, thus guiding LLMs\ntowards generating safe and idiomatic Rust code from a given C project. Our\nexperiments show that \\ourtool{} reduces unsafe usages in translated Rust by\n99.9\\% compared to both rule-based translation and traditional LLM-based\nrewriting, while achieving an average 29.3\\% higher functional correctness than\nthose fuzzing-enhanced LLM methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faC - Rust\u6307\u9488\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u5de5\u5177Ourtool\u8fdb\u884c\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7C\u5230Rust\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7C\u5230Rust\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6307\u9488\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaC - Rust\u6307\u9488\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u878d\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u6307\u9488\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u5b9e\u73b0Ourtool\u8fdb\u884c\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002", "result": "Ourtool\u6bd4\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c1199.9%\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6bd4\u6a21\u7cca\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u9ad829.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "Ourtool\u5728\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7C\u5230Rust\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5730\u9053\u7684Rust\u4ee3\u7801\u3002"}}

While effective for some complex queries, RAR remains\nvulnerable to errors and misleading outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)\noffers methods to estimate the confidence of systems' outputs. These methods,\nhowever, often handle simple queries with no retrieval or single-step\nretrieval, without properly handling RAR setup. Accurate estimation of UQ for\nRAR requires accounting for all sources of uncertainty, including those arising\nfrom retrieval and generation. In this paper, we account for all these sources\nand introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Consistency (R2C)--a novel UQ\nmethod for RAR. The core idea of R2C is to perturb the multi-step reasoning\nprocess by applying various actions to reasoning steps. These perturbations\nalter the retriever's input, which shifts its output and consequently modifies\nthe generator's input at the next step. Through this iterative feedback loop,\nthe retriever and generator continuously reshape one another's inputs, enabling\nus to capture uncertainty arising from both components. Experiments on five\npopular RAR systems across diverse QA datasets show that R2C improves AUROC by\nover 5% on average compared to the state-of-the-art UQ baselines.

Identifying which\nreasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably\npredicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and\nimprove overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that\ncharacterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations\nduring the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the\noverall change in latent representations between the start and end of\nreasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to\nwhich these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals\npredict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and\noutput-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across\nmultiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling\nmore effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up\nto 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.\nMoreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,\nenabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising\ncandidates.

Existing data-driven\nforecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short\ntime interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout\nfor long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers\nfrom two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and\nmulti-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)\nthe rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture\nof fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an\nAdaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather\nForecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a\nmulti-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time\nintervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures\nboth shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics\nacross different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes\nthe circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial\ninformation. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout\nscheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time\ninterval to forecast according to the current weather state.

With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that\neven a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query\nexpansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks.\nTo be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average\nimprovement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains\non multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faExpandSearch\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u67e5\u8be2\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3squeezer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u8df3QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u8df3QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u96be\u638c\u63e1\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u67e5\u8be2\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLM\u641c\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3squeezer\u6a21\u578b\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eExpandSearch\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4SOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad84.4%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u8df3QA\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u67e5\u8be2\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare\ncategories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,\ndiversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or\nredundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse\nGeometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric\nregularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method\nintroduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation\nscore, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort\ninter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures\ntemporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By\ncombining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class\nseparation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or\nredundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R\nconsistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with\nfewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that\nincorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can\nmake Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,\na key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines.

Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical\nFramework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that\naccelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable\nperformances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u89e3\u91ca\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u52a0\u901f\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6SHIFT\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55River - Valley\u666f\u89c2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u533a\u5206U\u5f62\u8c37\u548cV\u5f62\u8c37\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\uff1b\u63d0\u51faSHIFT\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u635f\u5931\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1bSHIFT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SHIFT\u6846\u67b6\u52a0\u901f\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Within this framework, LLM\nserves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a\nlow-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time\ndecision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop\nevolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the\nLLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization\nlayer.

In\nthis paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where\nsubtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream\nTC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF\nmodels has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that\nreliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains\na challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,\nnon-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks\ninfeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class\nimbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that\nwill produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining\nphysical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another\nsignificant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a\nnovel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate\nadversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model\nto approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of\ngradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function\nwith kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem.

Our findings indicate that some\nhuman-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific\nLLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for\nLLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,\nwe propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments.

To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem\ncorresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on\nthis, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs\nby adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to\ntranslation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among\nfirst-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then\ntranslate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the\ncorresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results\non benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms\ntranslating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed\ndataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which\nimproving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the\nfirst-order logic translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ffd\u7565\u76ee\u6807\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u578b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u542b\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u76ee\u6807\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u7a0b\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u76ee\u6807\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u5e94\u903b\u8f91\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5f97\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe96%\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6b21\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534725%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u6700\u4f18\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

FNOtD substantially improves\nlong-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical\ndynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.\nIt also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art\nnumerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u6539\u8fdbFNO\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFNOtD\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d77\u6d0b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u6d77\u6d0b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9075\u5faa\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6807\u51c6Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684FNOtD\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0cFNOtD\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u6d77\u6d0b\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u65f6\u5185\u5316\u8272\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u79ef\u5206\u6838\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u3002", "result": "FNOtD\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u6d77\u6d0b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6FNO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u6570\u503c\u6d77\u6d0b\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684FNOtD\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d77\u6d0b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse\nformats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with\nappropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support\nstandardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent\nexecution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and\nprogrammatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most\nadvanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%\naverage accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,\nhighlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical\nfindings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,\noften invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the\ncommunity to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for\nscientific discovery.

However,\nexisting methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and\nscore-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations.

While large language models\n(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by\na fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data\nis tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal\nanalysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex\nsystems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns\nfrom pairwise variable relationships.

Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data\n(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological\ndatasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures\nrobustness and generalizability.

We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and\nwe theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement\nlearning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning\nfrom mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences\nencoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the\nparity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement\nlearning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to\ngeneralize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or\ncomputational resources to do so.

To address\nthis challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains\na diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and\noptimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn\nfrom the diffusion model.

The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised\nreinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often\npropagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While\nprocess-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they\nlack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific\nsegmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the\nDimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges\nthe gap between these two approaches.

Finally, a third\nexperiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where\nthe inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class\ngenre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of\ncomplex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable\nfeature in audio processing applications.

We introduce\nCC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four\nlevels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity\nand offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our\nanalysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose\nmajor reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent\ninteraction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy\ncomplexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose\nCategory-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline\nparses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into\nfactual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex\nconditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis\nand enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive\npretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all\nsettings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt\nlength reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT\ndata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u6587\u6863\u81a8\u80c0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165CC - Gen\u57fa\u51c6\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCAP - CPT\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u6587\u6863\u968f\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\u800c\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u6587\u6863\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5185\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CC - Gen\u57fa\u51c6\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b\u63d0\u51faCategory - Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP - CPT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u7b56\u7565\u6587\u6863\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u89c4\u683c\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5316\u3002", "result": "CAP - CPT\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eSFT\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728Qwen - 3 - 32B\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728CC - Gen\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b097.3%\u63d0\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u7528\u6700\u5c11SFT\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3atau - Bench\u3002", "conclusion": "CAP - CPT\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

For example, function calls within the software can be\ncaptured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships\nbetween functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned\nby the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which\nfocus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph\nrepresentations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the\nsystem, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.\nWhile previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze\nsoftware behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph\nrepresentation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process\ninteraction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for\ndeeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a\npipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process\nCall Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint\nembeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose\nGeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from\nboth FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318\nmalicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run\nsandbox.

We introduce a new fine-tuning\nstrategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition\nability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher\nuses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then\nlabels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By\nmonitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile\nfor the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their\nresponses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two\nways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but\nadaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,\nthe teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across\nextensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements\nof up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,\nSTAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,\nAMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is\ncomplementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved\nusing STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains.

In contrast,\nconvolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size\nlimits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,\nwe introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification\ncapability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of\nconvolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the\nnumber of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational\nresources.

Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional\nspecialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical\ncapabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be\nfunction-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled\nTuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive\nCPT.

Existing KV\ncache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires\nidentical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct\nprecomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and\nrepeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially\naddress these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This\npaper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and\nhigh generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit\nsimilar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model\nfor generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for\nrestoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response\nquality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:\n(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache\nrecomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection\naccuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)\ngrouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.\nExperiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention\nperformance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%\nand 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%).

Specifically, in the citizen reimbursement claims\ninitiative, our solution increased reviewer productivity by 20.1%, while\nkeeping a negligible false-positive rate based on our test set observations.\nThese improvements resulted in an overall reduction of more than 2 months in\nthe total evaluation time, illustrating the impact of AI-driven automation in\nlarge-scale evaluation workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6b27\u76df\u53ca\u5176\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee\u7533\u8bf7\u8bc4\u4f30\u9047\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdAI\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u653f\u5e9c\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9eAI\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3001\u51cf\u8f7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b27\u76df\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee\u7533\u8bf7\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4eba\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u51fa\u73b0\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u56fd\u9645\u4e1a\u52a1\u62d3\u5c55\u7533\u8bf7\u548c\u516c\u6c11\u8282\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u6295\u8d44\u62a5\u9500\u7533\u8bf7\u4e24\u4e2a\u653f\u5e9c\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72AI\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "AI\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3001\u51cf\u8f7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u516c\u6c11\u62a5\u9500\u7533\u8bf7\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u63d0\u9ad820.1%\uff0c\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\uff0c\u603b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u8d852\u4e2a\u6708\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Our\ndataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as\ninteractive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,\nrequiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate\ninvestigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a\ndiagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions\nfrom well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades\nsignificantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under\nuncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes\nthat mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)\nfixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)\npremature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical\nconditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs\nreason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a\nstandardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for\nreal-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we\ncontribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how\nsequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdVivaBench\u591a\u8f6e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u987a\u5e8f\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u987a\u5e8f\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b1762\u4e2a\u533b\u751f\u6574\u7406\u4e34\u5e8a\u6848\u4f8b\u7684VivaBench\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u533b\u5b66\u57f9\u8bad\u53e3\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u660e\u786e\u4e34\u5e8a\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bca\u65ad\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "VivaBench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u533b\u7597AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7814\u7a76\u505a\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic\nand cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation\nextractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity\nrelations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their\nsemantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean\nretrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided\nconflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between\nthe query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer\ngeneration, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could\nmislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively\npreserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving\nsignificant improvements in both generation robustness and output\ntrustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art\ndefense methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSeCon - RAG\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6bd2\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bed\u4e49\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u65e0\u51b2\u7a81\u6846\u67b6SeCon - RAG\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528EIRE\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528EIRE\u5f15\u5bfc\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3002", "result": "SeCon - RAG\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u51b2\u7a81\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SeCon - RAG\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent work has introduced\nmulti-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a\nsingle model depending on runtime constraints.

Existing kernel-based approaches\noften test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified\nalternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel\nselection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the\nmanually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel\nselection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified\nfirst, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This\nchallenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select\na good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with\nthis challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,\ninstead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We\npropose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative\nsimilarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,\nQ) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two\nphases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer\nthe potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance\nof the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to\nderive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.\nLastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness\nvia extensive experiments on benchmark datasets.

The two-step approach includes: (1) a\ncorrelation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a\nhuman-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns:\nhuman-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and\nsuper-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement\nlevels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1\nperformance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of\nhuman judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern\nthat could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of\ncomplex judgments.

Despite advances in\nuncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly\nunpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering\nthe full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs\nthe design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in\nrobustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens\nthis paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the\nlifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive\nre-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and\ncontroller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers\nto continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending\nthis approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each\ncycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT\nmodels, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and\ninform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The\nframework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled\nlearning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more\nstable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly\nenhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency.

In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and\nconstruction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a\ngiven tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given\nrooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an\nalphabet \\Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,\nordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \\Sigma with tree edit distance at most d\nfrom T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )\nand constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for\ngenerating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,\nthe networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree\nedit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN\nand GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced\nsignificantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%\nand 48%, respectively.

Specifically, we\npropose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which\nbegins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally\nincreases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process\nuntil the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the\ngiven datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and\ninference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational\nefficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show\nthat the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve\nup to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a\ncompetitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edcODNs\u89e3\u51b3DNN\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "DNN\u867d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ODNs\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3cNAS\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u8f83\u6d45\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\u6df1\u5ea6\u76f4\u81f3\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u548cSVHN\u4e0a\uff0cResNet - 18\u548cResNet - 34\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8698.64%\u548c96.44%\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u522b\u4fdd\u630199.31%\u548c96.08%\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "ODNs\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their\ncloser resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the\nintricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In\nthis paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)\ndesigned to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural\nprocessing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity\npatterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p\nneurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by\npyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation\nvelocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity.

However, most fusion strategies are applied\nuniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We\nargue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide\nbenefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we\nreframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show\nthat performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each\nexcelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage\nthis finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and\nContext-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's\nprediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive\nper-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM.

The\ncontrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages\nautoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and\ncontrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,\nthereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user\nembeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we\ndemonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across\nmultiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation\nscenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can\neffectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in\nspecific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user\nrepresentation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faInstructUE\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u8868\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u53bb\u566a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u6237\u8868\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u884c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInstructUE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u501f\u52a9UserQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cInstructUE\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u4ee4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing alignment-stage\ndefenses, e.g., Vaccine, Repnoise, Booster, and T-Vaccine, mitigate harmful\nfine-tuning issues by enhancing the model's robustness during the alignment\nphase. While these methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue, they often\noverlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment\ndata. We observe that their defense performance and computational efficiency\nremain constrained by the quality and composition of the alignment dataset. To\naddress this limitation, we propose Pharmacist, a safety alignment data\ncuration solution that enhances defense against harmful fine-tuning by\nselecting a high-quality and safety-critical core subset from the original\nalignment data. The core idea of Pharmacist is to train an alignment data\nselector to rank alignment data. Specifically, up-ranking high-quality and\nsafety-critical alignment data, down-ranking low-quality and\nnon-safety-critical data. Empirical results indicate that models trained on\ndatasets selected by Pharmacist outperform those trained on datasets selected\nby existing selection methods in both defense and inference performance. In\naddition, Pharmacist can be effectively integrated with mainstream\nalignment-stage defense methods.

Code: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MSTDiff", "summary": "User mobility trajectory and mobile traffic data are essential for a wide\nspectrum of applications including urban planning, network optimization, and\nemergency management. However, large-scale and fine-grained mobility data\nremains difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and collection costs,\nmaking it essential to simulate realistic mobility and traffic patterns. User\ntrajectories and mobile traffic are fundamentally coupled, reflecting both\nphysical mobility and cyber behavior in urban environments. Despite this strong\ninterdependence, existing studies often model them separately, limiting the\nability to capture cross-modal dynamics. Therefore, a unified framework is\ncrucial. In this paper, we propose MSTDiff, a Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer\nfor joint simulation of mobile traffic and user trajectories. First, MSTDiff\napplies discrete wavelet transforms for multi-resolution traffic decomposition.\nSecond, it uses a hybrid denoising network to process continuous traffic\nvolumes and discrete location sequences. A transition mechanism based on urban\nknowledge graph embedding similarity is designed to guide semantically informed\ntrajectory generation. Finally, a multi-scale Transformer with cross-attention\ncaptures dependencies between trajectories and traffic. Experiments show that\nMSTDiff surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in traffic and trajectory\ngeneration tasks, reducing Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) across key\nstatistical metrics by up to 17.38% for traffic generation, and by an average\nof 39.53% for trajectory generation.

The Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained\nmodels by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,\nin heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the\nglobal model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of\nindividual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning\ntechniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address\nthis, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA\nmatrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and\nmagnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning\nmethod. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,\nwhich encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more\neffectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,\nby fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which\nencode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized\nknowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a\npipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further\nimproves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and\nlocal levels.

Yet most existing studies\nmeasure trust in terms of functionality, focusing on whether a system is\nreliable, accurate, or easy to use, while giving less attention to the social\nand emotional dimensions that are increasingly relevant for today's generative\nAI (GenAI) systems. These systems do not just process information; they\nconverse, respond, and collaborate with users, blurring the line between tool\nand partner. In this study, we introduce and validate the Human-AI Trust Scale\n(HAITS), a new measure designed to capture both the rational and relational\naspects of trust in GenAI. Drawing on prior trust theories, qualitative\ninterviews, and two waves of large-scale surveys in China and the United\nStates, we used exploratory (n = 1,546) and confirmatory (n = 1,426) factor\nanalyses to identify four key dimensions of trust: Affective Trust, Competence\nTrust, Benevolence & Integrity, and Perceived Risk. We then applied latent\nprofile analysis to classify users into six distinct trust profiles, revealing\nmeaningful differences in how affective-competence trust and trust-distrust\nframeworks coexist across individuals and cultures. Our findings offer a\nvalidated, culturally sensitive tool for measuring trust in GenAI and provide\nnew insight into how trust evolves in human-AI interaction.

This segregation between ambiguity set construction and control\nobjectives inherently introduces a structural misalignment, which undesirably\nleads to conservative control policies with sub-optimal performance. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end finite-horizon Wasserstein DRC\nframework that integrates the learning of anisotropic Wasserstein metrics with\ndownstream control tasks in a closed-loop manner, thus enabling ambiguity sets\nto be systematically adjusted along performance-critical directions and\nyielding more effective control policies. This framework is formulated as a\nbilevel program: the inner level characterizes dynamical system evolution under\nDRC, while the outer level refines the anisotropic metric leveraging\ncontrol-performance feedback across a range of initial conditions. To solve\nthis program efficiently, we develop a stochastic augmented Lagrangian\nalgorithm tailored to the bilevel structure. Theoretically, we prove that the\nlearned ambiguity sets preserve statistical finite-sample guarantees under a\nnovel radius adjustment mechanism, and we establish the well-posedness of the\nbilevel formulation by demonstrating its continuity with respect to the\nlearnable metric. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm converges to\nstationary points of the outer level problem, which are statistically\nconsistent with the optimal metric at a non-asymptotic convergence rate.\nExperiments on both numerical and inventory control tasks verify that the\nproposed framework achieves superior closed-loop performance and robustness\ncompared against state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57dfWasserstein\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfWasserstein\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4fdd\u5b88\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u6b20\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57dfWasserstein DRC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027Wasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u95ed\u73af\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u968f\u673a\u589e\u5e7f\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u53cc\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u826f\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5916\u5c42\u95ee\u9898\u9a7b\u70b9\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

Existing KV retrieval methods\nmitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.\nHowever, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due\nto per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially\nin long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning\nmodels, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.\nTo address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs\nexhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit\ndistinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.\nBuilding on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache\nretrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,\nLouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal\nlocality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing\ncomputation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,\nfine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input\nand output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's\nattention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.\nFurthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level\noptimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV\nclustering and retrieval.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework\nthat enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting\nprivacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by\ndividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each\npropagating information independently through the graph topology. The\naggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This\nframework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves\nrobustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance\nutility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets\ndemonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node\nclassification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our\nanalysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations\nrather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility\nwithout compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further\nconfirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse\nscenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for\ngraph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\uff08MFP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7a00\u758f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b8c\u6574\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u542b\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMFP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5404\u89c6\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u72ec\u7acb\u4f20\u64ad\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMFP\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u4f20\u64ad\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u66ff\u4ee3\u63d2\u8865\u3002", "conclusion": "MFP\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u542b\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6ce8\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To\naddress this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that\nreconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model\nincludes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial\ndependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and\nFrechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing\ntest with expert cardiologists.

This preprint has been accepted for publication\n  in Elsevier JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS (JNCA)", "summary": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications\nhas introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security\nchallenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic\ninterpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data\nrepresentations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box\njailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the\nsecurity measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that\nrely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic,\ntwo-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to\nempirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2\nleverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious\njailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a\nmore nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate\nsuperior jailbreak performance.

In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this\ngap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,\nlies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including\ndiffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of\nlearning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary\nDifferential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer\ndesign space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative\nTrajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns\nthe entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical\nfor offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled\nadaptations.

Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided\nfeatures outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =\n8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5).

Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully\nunderstand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible\nto irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning\nframework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a\nMulti-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various\ninformation levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop\nquestions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network\n(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs\nintra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the\ninformation aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates\nmulti-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the\nimpact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we\nfurther propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the\nQSGNN.

These networks effortlessly identify and select\nfeatures in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to\ndetermine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box\",\nwhere users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical\nresults. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background\ninformation that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such\nhidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to\ndistinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore\nwhether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify\ndataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in\nsome situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it\nmore difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank\nbackground. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,\nnot necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were\ntested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid\ndatasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,\nnon-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,\nmaking classification more challenging.

In\nthis paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly\nincentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to\nunderstand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our\nmain finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,\nrepresentation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden\nstates significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for\npost-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For\ninference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves\nefficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and\nreasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%\nimprovement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks.

However, these methods often\nstruggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal\napproaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness\nbut are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time\napplications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel\nend-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D\nrepresentations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of\nboth modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features\nfrom 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based\ngait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an\nintermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D\ngeometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational\nefficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually\nreconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where\nthe loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,\nand 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial\nalignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative\nfeatures from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a\ncomputationally efficient manner.

Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five\ncomplementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on\nour benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on\nFML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies\noutperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings\nsuggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective\nresearch outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement.

In this paper, we conduct a systematic\nformalization for stego attacks on open-source LLMs by enumerating all possible\nthreat models associated with adversary objectives, knowledge, and\ncapabilities. Therein, the threat posed by adversaries with internal knowledge,\nwho inject payloads and triggers during the model sharing phase, is of\npractical interest. We go even further and propose the first stego attack on\nopen-source LLMs, dubbed SASER, which wields impacts through identifying\ntargeted parameters, embedding payloads, injecting triggers, and executing\npayloads sequentially. Particularly, SASER enhances the attack robustness\nagainst quantization-based local deployment by de-quantizing the embedded\npayloads. In addition, to achieve stealthiness, SASER devises the\nperformance-aware importance metric to identify targeted parameters with the\nleast degradation of model performance. Extensive experiments on LlaMA2-7B and\nChatGLM3-6B, without quantization, show that the stealth rate of SASER\noutperforms existing stego attacks (for general DNNs) by up to 98.1%, while\nachieving the same attack success rate (ASR) of 100%. More importantly, SASER\nimproves ASR on quantized models from 0 to 100% in all settings.

Specifically, to stimulate the\nself-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based\non a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,\nany masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The\nframework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation\nability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like\nimage$\\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\\rightarrow$question.

This paper\nintroduces a novel framework combining population-coded Spiking Neural Networks\n(SNNs) with DRL to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the\nevent-driven, asynchronous computation of SNNs alongside the robust policy\noptimization capabilities of DRL, achieving a balance between energy efficiency\nand control performance. Central to this framework is the Population-coded\nSpiking Actor Network (PopSAN), which encodes high-dimensional observations\ninto neuronal population activities and enables optimal policy learning through\ngradient-based updates. We evaluate our method on the Isaac Gym platform using\nthe PixMC benchmark with complex robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental\nresults on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate that our approach achieves energy\nsavings of up to 96.10% compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANNs) while maintaining comparable control performance. The trained SNN\npolicies exhibit robust finger position tracking with minimal deviation from\ncommanded trajectories and stable target height maintenance during\npick-and-place operations.

We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised\npre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face\nimages. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize\nmasked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM\nto encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,\nwe formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet\neffective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue\nmeaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We\npresent a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with\nID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,\nvanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models\nfor downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,\ncross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics.

Video Summary: https://youtu.be/txYc9b1oflU", "summary": "Dynamic manipulation, such as robot tossing or throwing objects, has recently\ngained attention as a novel paradigm to speed up logistic operations. However,\nthe focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective\nof its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to\naccurately \"throw-flip\" objects to a desired landing pose (position and\norientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from\nparasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing\nposes. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the\nimpulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that\neffectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the\nfeasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free\nflight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.\nReal robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip\nobjects to a pose target within ($\\pm$5 cm, $\\pm$45 degrees) threshold in\ndozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile\ndynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to\nunseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show\nthat past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused,\naccelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass\n(CoM) shift.

Addressing these challenges requires methods\nthat distill complex aerosol properties into compact yet physically meaningful\nforms. Generative autoencoder models provide such a pathway. We present a\nframework for learning deep variational autoencoder (VAE) models of speciated\nmass and number concentration distributions, which capture detailed aerosol\nsize-composition characteristics. By compressing hundreds of original\ndimensions into ten latent variables, the approach enables efficient storage\nand processing while preserving the fidelity of key diagnostics, including\ncloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectra, optical scattering and absorption\ncoefficients, and ice nucleation properties. Results show that CCN spectra are\neasiest to reconstruct accurately, optical properties are moderately difficult,\nand ice nucleation properties are the most challenging.

We\ndemonstrate that classifiers capture deeper stylistic regularities in program\ndataflow and structure, rather than relying on surface-level features. As a\nresult, attribution remains effective even after mangling, comment removal, and\nheavy code transformations.

This limits higher-resolution transient climate\nsimulations with current computational resources.

While second-order methods can significantly accelerate\nconvergence in light-tailed or bounded-noise settings, such algorithms are\noften brittle and lack guarantees under heavy-tailed noise -- precisely the\nregimes where robustness is most critical. In this work, we take a first step\ntoward a theoretical understanding of second-order optimization under\nheavy-tailed noise. We consider a setting where stochastic gradients and\nHessians have only bounded $p$-th moments, for some $p\\in (1,2]$, and establish\ntight lower bounds on the sample complexity of any second-order method. We then\ndevelop a variant of normalized stochastic gradient descent that leverages\nsecond-order information and provably matches these lower bounds. To address\nthe instability caused by large deviations, we introduce a novel algorithm\nbased on gradient and Hessian clipping, and prove high-probability upper bounds\nthat nearly match the fundamental limits.

We then leverage a large-scale\ndataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare\nevaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of\npeople and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative\nqueries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These\nqueries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI\nevaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to\nquantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to\npeople in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.\nHowever, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to\ngame-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more\n\"jaggedness\" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater\ndifficulty of quantifying this query.

While numerous studies explored methods for\ndetecting and detoxifying such content, most have focused primarily on English,\nleaving low-resource language underrepresented.

This challenge becomes even more pronounced when user employ\nobfuscation techniques to evade detection systems. Therefore, we propose a\n\\textbf{KOTOX: Korean Toxic Dataset} for deobfuscation and detoxicification to\naddress this issue. We categorize various obfuscation approaches based on\nlinguistic characteristics of Korean and define a set of transformation rules\ngrounded in real-word examples. Using these rules, we construct three dataset\nversions (easy, normal, and hard) representing different levels of obfuscation\ndifficulty.

In this survey, we\nexplore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual\nfoundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based\nagents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along\nthree fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as\nthe system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through\nreasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,\nwhereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their\nproblem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)\nAgentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or\nphysical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and\nsustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further\naccelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source\ntraining frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic\nMLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and\noutline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field.

Traditional\nshortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally\nprohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous\nuser demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization.

Machine learning potentials (MLPs), with their capacity to capture\nmany-body interactions, can provide accurate approximations of the potential of\nmean force (PMF) in CG models. Current CG MLPs are typically trained in a\nbottom-up manner via force matching, which in practice relies on configurations\nsampled from the unbiased equilibrium Boltzmann distribution to ensure\nthermodynamic consistency. This convention poses two key limitations: first,\nsufficiently long atomistic trajectories are needed to reach convergence; and\nsecond, even once equilibrated, transition regions remain poorly sampled. To\naddress these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of\nfreedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the\nunbiased potential.

Learning-based\napproaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models,\nremoving the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation\nfusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer\nblocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are\ncommon in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data\nfurther exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning\nmethods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors.

Specifically, we first\nintroduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory\ninto overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory\nmodeling.

When applied to real-world\ndownstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data\nand out-of-distribution (OOD) data.

This highlights the\nimportance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD\ndata, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In\nthis paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set\ndata when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly\nreducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel\nOOD score, named {\\Delta}Energy. {\\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the\nvanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD\ndetection. Furthermore, {\\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD\ngeneralization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound\nmaximization for {\\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to\nnot only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,\nwhich serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this\nfinding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving\nVLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection.

This method provides numerous benefits,\nincluding fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed\nto zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training\nin such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information\nretrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text\ninstance is \"similar\" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label\nis determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art\nsentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text\ninstance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary\nclassification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon\nprevious literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and\nevaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based\nclassification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the\nsemantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,\nand label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic\nmulti-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity\ndistributions show statistically significant differences across models,\ndatasets and even label sets.

Our\napproach integrates seamlessly with off-policy RL methods such as SAC and TD3,\nand achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion\ntasks with sparse costs, reducing constraint violations by up to 126 times\nwhile increasing returns by over an order of magnitude compared to prior\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u8282\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5065\u8eab\u623f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56de\u62a5 - \u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6216\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u8282\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u52a8\u4f5c\u8c03\u5236\u4fdd\u7559\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u96c6\u6210\u5230SAC\u548cTD3\u7b49\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5065\u8eab\u623f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56de\u62a5 - \u6210\u672c\u6bd4\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c11126\u500d\uff0c\u56de\u62a5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

RAGen supports multiple RAG\nadaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the\nLLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features\nsemantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval,\nalong with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust\nreasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and\nevolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially\nsuitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and\nenterprise knowledge bases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRAGen\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57dfQAC\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cdRAG\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u6548\u5c06RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u9002\u914d\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u4e1a\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u6587\u6863\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f9d\u636eBloom\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7b54\u6848\u914d\u5bf9\uff1b\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5757\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u53d6\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cdRAG\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u548c\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6587\u6863\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u3002", "conclusion": "RAGen\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u53d1\u5c55\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

While deep learning models have advanced in network\narchitecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated\ndata. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal\ntasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random\nmixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the\nlack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose\nMS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that\nautomatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key\ncomponents of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)\nstrategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples\nwith contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module\nusing multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios\ndynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment\nAlignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across\nmodalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional\nregularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone\nnetwork jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six\nstate-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms\nexisting methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment\naugmentation.

However, the necessity of each of\nthese principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically\ndeconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax\nthese principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid\narchitectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical\nanalysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their\nabsence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical\nform and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when\npreserved in just a subset of layers.

Determining the scale bars is an important first step of\naccurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual\noperations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this\nissue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and\nextraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection\nand text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent.

Existing\napproaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to\ngeneralize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose\nEvaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time\nfake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process\naccording to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a\nsequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)\nEvidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into\ndecision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)\nReasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is\nadequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates\nsentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the\naccuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo\nlabels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge\nthrough interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the\nevaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable\nevaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.\nMoreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news\nfor evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves\ngeneralization to real-time news.

While generally true for\nshort-term tasks, the \"frozen world\" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning\ntasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think\nthrough problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model\nstarts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the\nfrozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic\nscenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs\non a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to\nin-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require\nlong-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:\neven state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can\nfail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with\nperformance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the\nreasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,\nincluding reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final\nanswer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon\nreasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where\nperformance degrades while incorporating updated information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6311\u6218\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u201c\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e16\u754c\u201d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u79cd\u65b0\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u201c\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e16\u754c\u201d\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30LRMs\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e2d\u65ad\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e24\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30LRMs\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u59cb\u7ec8\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86LRMs\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u591a\u4e0b\u964d60%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3001\u6050\u614c\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u6000\u7591\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Large language models equipped with tools and the\ncommunication standard OPC UA are utilized to control machines in natural\nlanguage. Instead of touch interaction, which is currently the state-of-the-art\nmedium for interaction in operations, the proposed approach enables operators\nto talk or text with machines. This allows commands such as 'Please decrease\nthe temperature by 20 % in machine 1 and set the motor speed to 5000 rpm in\nmachine 2.' The large language model receives the user input and selects one of\nthree predefined tools that connect to an OPC UA server and either change or\nread the value of a node. Afterwards, the result of the tool execution is\npassed back to the language model, which then provides a final response to the\nuser. The approach is universally designed and can therefore be applied to any\nmachine that supports the OPC UA standard. The large language model is neither\nfine-tuned nor requires training data, only the relevant machine credentials\nand a parameter dictionary are included within the system prompt. The approach\nis evaluated on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller with four\nmachine parameters in a case study of fifty synthetically generated commands on\nfive different models. The results demonstrate high success rate, with\nproprietary GPT 5 models achieving accuracies between 96.0 % and 98.0 %, and\nopen-weight models reaching up to 90.0 %.

We identify neurons and attention heads that locally\nimplement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal\nanalysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement\ninterventions.

Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have\nallowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can\naugment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like\nsemantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is\nlimited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.\n  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train\nControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control\nmechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images\nfrom the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads\nto significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further\nsupervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when\ncompared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any\nstrict learning of an image style.

This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets\nwithin application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in\nMulti-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the\nDelay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem,\nand highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel\nMA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and\ndistributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical\nnetworking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based\non the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where\ncentralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths\nand schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby\nmaximizing on-time packet delivery.

To address this, we\npropose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for \"thinking\nwith images\" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text\nreasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into\nimages as \"visual thought\", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we\nfirst construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark\nfor Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.\nSecond, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art\nimage-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures\ninto codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model\nfor solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model\nachieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully\nvalidating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our\nwork opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides\nthe community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and\nstrong approach for such problems.
