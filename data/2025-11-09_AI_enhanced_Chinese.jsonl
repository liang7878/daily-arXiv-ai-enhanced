Most existing studies characterize this mapping by\ntraining models to directly encode visual stimuli into neural responses or\ndecode neural responses into visual stimuli. However, due to neural response\nvariability and limited neural recording techniques, these studies suffer from\noverfitting and lack generalizability. Motivated by this challenge, in this\npaper we shift the tasks from conventional direct encoding and decoding to\ndiscriminative encoding and decoding, which are more reasonable. And on top of\nthis we propose a cross-modal alignment approach, named Visual-Neural Alignment\n(VNA). To thoroughly test the performance of the three methods (direct\nencoding, direct decoding, and our proposed VNA) on discriminative encoding and\ndecoding tasks, we conduct extensive experiments on three invasive visual\ncortex datasets, involving two types of subject mammals (mice and macaques).\nThe results demonstrate that our VNA generally outperforms direct encoding and\ndirect decoding, indicating our VNA can most precisely characterize the above\nvisual-neural mapping among the three methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5411\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faVNA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u89c6\u89c9 - \u795e\u7ecf\u6620\u5c04\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u795e\u7ecf\u53cd\u5e94\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5f55\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u8f6c\u4e3a\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u51faVisual - Neural Alignment (VNA) \u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u76ae\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "VNA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "VNA\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6700\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u8868\u5f81\u89c6\u89c9 - \u795e\u7ecf\u6620\u5c04\u3002"}}

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks.

Ruby, despite its widespread use in web\ndevelopment and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received\nlittle attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel\nlightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven,\niterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that\ngenerate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a\ncorrect solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid\nreliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead\noperating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven\nfeedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a\npass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches.

As biological brains likely lack slots, we consider how they\nmight achieve similar functional outcomes without them by building on the\nneurally-inspired modern Hopfield network (MHN; Krotov & Hopfield, 2021), which\nstores patterns in the connection weights of an individual neuron. We propose\nextensions of this approach to increase its biological plausibility as a model\nof memory and to capture an important advantage of slot-based computation in\ncontemporary language models. For memory, neuroscience research suggests that\nthe weights of overlapping sparse ensembles of neurons, rather than a dedicated\nindividual neuron, are used to store a memory. We introduce the K-winner MHN,\nextending the approach to ensembles, and find that within a continual learning\nregime, the ensemble-based MHN exhibits greater retention of older memories, as\nmeasured by the graded sensitivity measure d', than a standard (one-neuron)\nMHN. Next, we consider the powerful use of slot-based memory in contemporary\nlanguage models.

However, generating comments\nthat are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting\nstylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.\nWe introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for\ncontrollable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video\nsegmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt\nconstruction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),\nrhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content\nextraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM\ndirectly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through\nexplicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and\nevaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin\n(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy\nskits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk\nshows.

Abstract shortened to meet arXiv's requirement", "summary": "The Fisher market equilibrium for private goods and the Lindahl equilibrium\nfor public goods are classic and fundamental solution concepts for market\nequilibria. While Fisher market equilibria have been well-studied, the\ntheoretical foundations for Lindahl equilibria remain substantially\nunderdeveloped.\n  In this work, we propose a unified duality framework for market equilibria.\nWe show that Lindahl equilibria of a public goods market correspond to Fisher\nmarket equilibria in a dual Fisher market with dual utilities, and vice versa.\nThe dual utility is based on the indirect utility, and the correspondence\nbetween the two equilibria works by exchanging the roles of allocations and\nprices.\n  Using the duality framework, we address the gaps concerning the computation\nand dynamics for Lindahl equilibria and obtain new insights and developments\nfor Fisher market equilibria. First, we leverage this duality to analyze\nwelfare properties of Lindahl equilibria. For concave homogeneous utilities, we\nprove that a Lindahl equilibrium maximizes Nash Social Welfare (NSW). For\nconcave non-homogeneous utilities, we show that a Lindahl equilibrium achieves\n$(1/e)^{1/e}$ approximation to the optimal NSW, and the approximation ratio is\ntight. Second, we apply the duality framework to market dynamics, including\nproportional response dynamics (PRD) and t\\^atonnement. We obtain new market\ndynamics for the Lindahl equilibria from market dynamics in the dual Fisher\nmarket.

Yet the best models still suffer from\nhallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap\nbetween their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks\nthat are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,\nwe build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With\nmore than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training\ndata to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by\ncognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking \"what's\nin common?\". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models\nspecifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that\nperceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning\nacross scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning\nmodels. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best\nperforming model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,\nconsisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,\nwe find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present\nin the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen\nduring training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide\nmodest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs\nshow bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer\npromise.

Recent work by Bressan (Algorithmica, 2021) has shown that\nthis problem has efficient dynamic programming algorithms using a graph\nparameter called DAG treewidth. Bressan used DAG treewidth to design a fast\nalgorithm for counting homomorphisms, subgraph isomorphisms, and induced\nsubgraph isomorphisms that use polynomial space. Bera, Gishboliner, Levanzov,\nSeshadhri, and Shapira (SODA, 2021) provided a characterization of graphs with\nDAG treewidth one.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new graph parameter called DAG treedepth and\nshow that it yields efficient divide and conquer algorithms that use only\nconstant space (in the unit-cost RAM model).

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an\nalternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned\nrepresentations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim.

Yet\nhow closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.\nThis gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical\napplications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs\nineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a\ndigital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic\nprompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing\nthree open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama\nreproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human\ndeviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash\nequilibrium predictions.

In\nthis work, we develop local algorithms for estimating hitting times between a\npair of vertices $u,v$ without accessing the full graph, overcoming scalability\nissues of prior global methods. Our first algorithm uses the key insight that\nhitting time computations can be truncated at the meeting time of two\nindependent random walks from $u$ and $v$. This leads to an efficient estimator\nanalyzed via the Kronecker product graph and Markov Chain Chernoff bounds. We\nalso present an algorithm extending the work of [Peng et al.; KDD 2021], that\nintroduces a novel adaptation of the spectral cutoff technique to account for\nthe asymmetry of hitting times. This adaptation captures the directionality of\nthe underlying random walk and requires non-trivial modifications to ensure\naccuracy and efficiency.

At the same\ntime, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and\noptimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs\ncan represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle\nground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,\nbut too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent\ncultural diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6709\u54cd\u5e94\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u5316\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u4ee3\u8868\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u8d28\u7591\u5176\u80fd\u5426\u4ee3\u8868\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u970d\u592b\u65af\u6cf0\u5fb7\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\u768463\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u621011\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u6587\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u5bf910\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u90fd\u4f1a\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4ea7\u751f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u56fd\u5bb6\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u660e\u786e\u6587\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u66f4\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u6bd4\u82f1\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u52a0\u6587\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u5316\u4f5c\u51fa\u54cd\u5e94\u4ea7\u751f\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u6587\u5316\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u4ee3\u8868\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

While flood\nprediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,\npractical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full\nimplementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow\nconditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents\na data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to\noptimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater\nsystem, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case\nstudy. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate\nprofiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -\nleveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR\nfactorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes\nbased on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the\nrepresentativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the\nDSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three\noptimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction\nperformance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to\n75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty\nin measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and\nimproves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances\ncomputational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy\nflow reconstruction with minimal sensors.

Using this framework, we\nconduct a controlled empirical study on three representative agent\narchitectures implemented upon a unified foundation to isolate the impact of\nworkflow design. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art agents can fulfill\napproximately 50\\% of requirements on \\bench{}, but their success is critically\ndependent on the architectural strategy for task decomposition and\ncollaboration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the primary bottleneck\nis the omission of requirements and inadequate self-verification.

This\nstudy addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks\nthat recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit\nmodels. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via\nXGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation\nreweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP\nrebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate\ncalibration using incremental Ridge regression.

We\nintroduce a bipartite graph framework that unifies and extends several known\nformulations, including the bipartite matching, matroid intersection, and\nrandom-order matroid secretary problems. In this model, elements form a\nbipartite graph between agents and items, and the objective is to select a\nmatching that satisfies feasibility constraints on both sides, given by two\nindependence systems.\n  We study the free-order setting, where the algorithm may adaptively choose\nthe next element to reveal. For $k$-matroid intersection, we leverage a core\nlemma by (Feldman, Svensson and Zenklusen, 2022) to design an\n$\\Omega(1/k^2)$-competitive algorithm, extending known results for single\nmatroids. Building on this, we identify the structural property underlying our\napproach and introduce $k$-growth systems. We establish a generalized core\nlemma for $k$-growth systems, showing that a suitably defined set of critical\nelements retains a $\\Omega(1/k^2)$ fraction of the optimal weight.

Simply satisfying formal constraints\ndoes not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.\nWe propose \\textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting\nas a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political\ninterests.

This addresses a critical\nand open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy\nconstraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem\nby introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for\ntraining to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first\nproxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance\nmeasures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of\nthese metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that\nleverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies\ncorrelate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment\nanalysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS\nconsistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced\ncharacteristics.

This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition\nbased adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for\nmulti-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term\nforecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically\nignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated\nmodules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components;\na Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations\nbased on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances\nprediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network\ntraining. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates\nboth numerical and categorical features.

Yet, since they\nwere not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle\neven in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative\nRegret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure\nthat repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base\nmodel. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,\nselects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior\nmethods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely\non manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the\nregret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.\nThis reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and\nprovides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results\nshow that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -\nfrom Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and\nadvanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and\nreasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,\naction spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts.

Our agent matches, or exceeds, the\nperformance of a conventional baseline while dramatically compressing context,\nachieving more than a 6-fold reduction in initial system prompt context and a\n10- to 25-fold reduction in context growth rate based on the interaction\nverbosity, demonstrating that strategic context management is key to unlocking\ncapable and persistent on-device AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefAI\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u538b\u7f29\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefAI\u4ee3\u7406\u53d7\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u95e8LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6781\u7b80\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\u548c\u5373\u65f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u51cf\u5c11\u8d856\u500d\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u957f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e10 - 25\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6218\u7565\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u662f\u89e3\u9501\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefAI\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder\nanchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node\nembeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving\nrepresentation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive\nlearning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous\nones in the latent space.

At each iteration, constraints with violations\nexceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those\nwith zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update.

The method takes\nmulti-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to\nachieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A\nlearnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic\nevolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head\nself-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal\nsequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term\nfluctuations across different temporal scales.

However, existing approaches to handling missing data in\nlongitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian\nnetworks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the\ndata. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is\nparticularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding\nthe temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and\napplicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a\nfull Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains\nunderdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method\nfor learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as\nan unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the\nunobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions,\nallowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our\nmethod on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from\ncritically ill patients.

To address this\nlimitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for\nWorst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes\nfeature representations to suppress spurious cues.

By imposing theoretical constraints at\nthe embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while\nreducing sensitivity to spurious patterns.

While real-world language is inherently\nambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically\nbenchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that\nwhile current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive\nassumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on\nambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first\nambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer\ndistributions estimated from factual co-occurrence.

However, existing graph models for\nrelational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal\ninformation merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather\nthan a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.\nTo address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances\nglobal context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture\ntemporally relevant relationships.

This work highlights abductive\ninference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and\nexplainability of RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f25\u8865\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u7f3a\u5931\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5408\u7406\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u589e\u5f3aRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area\nsearch and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a\nsignificant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine\ncollaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an\nerror-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a\nlow-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,\nthis study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed\nframework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and\nmulti-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It\nthen employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,\nhierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This\nclosed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,\nproviding active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual\nmonitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR\ntask. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and\ncommand-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task\ncompletion time by approximately $64.2\\%$ and improved task success rate by\n$7\\%$.

However, the complicated maritime environment often\ncauses camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant\nchallenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient\nDual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the\nframework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an\nobject detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated\nbranch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible\nColumnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to\nleverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,\na lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to\ncapture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.\nAnother branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by\nconstructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation\nwithin the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.\nFinally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines\nmotion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,\nocclusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset\ndemonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT\nattains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while\nmaintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.\nCode is available at:\nhttps://github.com/BiscuitsLzy/DMSORT-An-efficient-parallel-maritime-multi-object-tracking-architecture-.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684DMSORT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6d77\u4e0a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u6d77\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u6d77\u6d0b\u73af\u5883\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u7ed9\u6d77\u4e0a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDMSORT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5e76\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u4e0e\u4eff\u5c04\u8865\u507f\uff0c\u96c6\u6210RCDN\u7528\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1Li - TAE\u63d0\u53d6\u5916\u89c2\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u5206\u652f\u89e3\u8026\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u805a\u7c7b\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u6d77\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eReID\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u5feb\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u6296\u52a8\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DMSORT\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6d77\u6d0b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Accurate\nregistration of images from different modalities is an essential step in\ndigital pathology.

We used a dataset\nof 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing\nsteps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,\nVahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and\ndenoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,\nwhich first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration\nin two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance\nwas evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported\nthe median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values\n(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based\nevaluation using ten manually selected key points.

Shannon\nentropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information\nencoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold,\nand Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information\nencoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding\nsimilarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was\nintroduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare,\nand which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually,\nanalytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show\nthat LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary\ninformation about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both\nLCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of\n``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence.

Computed Tomography\n(CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate\ncardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow\nvelocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.\n  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved\nframework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.\n  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel\nbifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with\nvarying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings.\nWe compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed\nimages (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.\n  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by\navoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was\nrobust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower\nmean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow\nwas compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with\nshorter pulse widths.\n  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based\nflow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood\nflow assessment.

However, it remains challenging to\ngenerate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across\ndifferent patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with\nirregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and\ninconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this\nwork, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline\nwith deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)\nmeshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing\naortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a\nuniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element\ncorrespondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the\nlearning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function\nwith only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness\nregularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and\nelement quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach\nproduces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and\nshape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to\nthe traditional methods.

Subgroups define partial symmetries, which have not\nbeen extensively studied in previous research, which has focused on symmetries\ndefined by whole groups. Symmetrizing the 19 common ansatzes with respect to\nthese varying-sized subgroup representations, we compute three classes of\nmetrics that describe how the common ansatz structures behave under varying\namounts of symmetries. The first metric is based on the norm of the difference\nbetween the original and symmetrized generators, while the second metric counts\ndepth, size, and other characteristics from the symmetrized circuits. The third\nclass of metrics includes expressibility and entangling capability. The results\ndemonstrate varying gate overhead across the studied ansatzes and confirm that\nincreased symmetry reduces expressibility of the circuits. In most cases,\nincreased symmetry increases entanglement capability. These results help select\nsufficiently expressible and computationally efficient ansatze patterns for\ngeometric quantum machine learning applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u8861\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60ansatzes\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e09\u7c7b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540cansatzes\u95e8\u5f00\u9500\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9ad8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u7535\u8def\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u5347\u7ea0\u7f20\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002ansatz\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5316\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5f00\u9500\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60ansatzes\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u79f0\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf919\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1ansatzes\u6309\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u5b50\u7fa4\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5316\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e09\u7c7b\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540cansatzes\u95e8\u5f00\u9500\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u7535\u8def\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u589e\u52a0\u7ea0\u7f20\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u8db3\u591f\u53ef\u8868\u8fbe\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684ansatz\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

For this reason, developing methods for the automated\nsegmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has\ndriven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the\nimpracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,\nusually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when\napplying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,\nin this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,\nvoxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks.

However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it.

This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI)\npipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic\nDark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for\na forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model\nbased on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one\nmillion self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level.\nLeveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural\nnetworks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn\nlow-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with\ntarget parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation\nof the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter\nspace spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias\nparameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear\nbias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference\npipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic\ncontaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs.\nOur forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter\nconstraints, achieving $2-3\\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\\Omega_m -\nS_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and\neffectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These\nresults demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for\nupcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5f31\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u548c\u661f\u7cfb\u805a\u7c7b\u56fe\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684SBI\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u5b87\u5b99\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5373\u5c06\u5230\u6765\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u505a\u51c6\u5907\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eCosmoGridV1\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6b63\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u795e\u7ecf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u5408\u6210\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u03a9_m - S_8\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u4f18\u503c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e24\u70b9\u7edf\u8ba1\u9ad82 - 3\u500d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6253\u7834\u53c2\u6570\u7b80\u5e76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684SBI\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u5373\u5c06\u5230\u6765\u7684IV\u9636\u6bb5\u5bbd\u573a\u6210\u50cf\u8c03\u67e5\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
