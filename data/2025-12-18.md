  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型在符号操作任务上较脆弱，需统一视角理解其现象。

Method: 将自注意力和残差流解释为实现近似向量符号架构，用代数视角关联模型内部与推理任务，提出架构偏置和训练目标。

Result: 解释了Transformer的特征失败模式，提出VSA启发的架构偏置、训练目标和衡量指标。

Conclusion: 将注意力视为软向量符号计算为构建更具解释性和逻辑可靠性的推理系统提供了原则性途径。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring "VSA-likeness" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.

Motivation: 现有知识图谱问答基准多假设知识图谱完整，忽略了图谱不完整时需推理得出答案的现实，要弥补这一差距。

Method: 提出构建不完整知识图谱基准的方法；提出自适应图推理代理GR - Agent，构建交互环境，将知识图谱问答形式化为代理 - 环境交互。

Result: 使用提出的方法构建的基准实验显示现有方法在不完整情况下性能下降；GR - Agent在完整和不完整设置下均优于非训练基线，与基于训练的方法表现相当。

Conclusion: 现有方法在不完整知识图谱下推理能力有限，GR - Agent能有效应对知识图谱不完整问题，有较好性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong results on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), but most benchmarks assume complete knowledge graphs (KGs) where direct supporting triples exist. This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings.

Method: 引入形式化的决策理论框架来分析价值（不）对齐、认知准确性和可及性之间的权衡，并考虑主体对这些因素的不确定性。

Result: 揭示通用委托和特定场景委托的区别，通用委托需近乎完美的价值对齐和完全的认知信任；特定场景委托在存在显著不对齐时也可能最优。开发新的评分框架量化事前决策。

Conclusion: 工作提供了在给定场景下确定AI是否足够对齐的原则性方法，应从追求完美对齐转向管理不确定性下委托的风险和回报。

Abstract: When should we delegate decisions to AI systems? While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.

### [4] [IaC Generation with LLMs: An Error Taxonomy and A Study on Configuration Knowledge Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14792)
*Roman Nekrasov,Stefano Fossati,Indika Kumara,Damian Andrew Tamburri,Willem-Jan van den Heuvel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过注入结构化配置知识提升大语言模型生成基础设施即代码（IaC）的能力，虽技术验证成功率提高，但意图对齐遇瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型生成正确且符合意图的IaC成功率低，旨在提高基于大语言模型的IaC生成能力。

Method: 增强IaC - Eval基准，开发错误分类法，实施从Naive RAG到Graph RAG等一系列知识注入技术。

Result: 注入结构化配置知识使技术验证成功率提升至75.3%，总体成功率达62.6%，但意图对齐停滞。

Conclusion: 存在“正确性 - 一致性差距”，大语言模型在实现用户细微意图方面仍有限。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently exhibit low success rates in generating correct and intent-aligned Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This research investigated methods to improve LLM-based IaC generation, specifically for Terraform, by systematically injecting structured configuration knowledge. To facilitate this, an existing IaC-Eval benchmark was significantly enhanced with cloud emulation and automated error analysis. Additionally, a novel error taxonomy for LLM-assisted IaC code generation was developed. A series of knowledge injection techniques was implemented and evaluated, progressing from Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to more sophisticated Graph RAG approaches. These included semantic enrichment of graph components and modeling inter-resource dependencies. Experimental results demonstrated that while baseline LLM performance was poor (27.1% overall success), injecting structured configuration knowledge increased technical validation success to 75.3% and overall success to 62.6%. Despite these gains in technical correctness, intent alignment plateaued, revealing a "Correctness-Congruence Gap" where LLMs can become proficient "coders" but remain limited "architects" in fulfilling nuanced user intent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农村农业地区面临气候相关风险，以往研究呼吁适应性风险管理解决方案和决策策略，现有系统在动态协作推理和上下文感知输出方面有不足。

Conclusion: 智能体AI在农业气候适应的可持续和负责决策支持方面有潜力。

Abstract: Agricultural regions in rural areas face damage from climate-related risks, including droughts, heavy rainfall, and shifting weather patterns. Prior research calls for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly agentic AI, offers a promising path forward. Agentic AI systems consist of autonomous, specialized agents capable of solving complex, dynamic tasks. While past systems have relied on single-agent models or have used multi-agent frameworks only for static functions, there is a growing need for architectures that support dynamic collaborative reasoning and context-aware outputs. To bridge this gap, we present AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system for climate adaptation decision support in agriculture, with a focus on vulnerable rural communities. AgroAskAI features a modular, role-specialized architecture that uses a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating real-time tools and datasets. The system has built-in governance mechanisms that mitigate hallucination and enable internal feedback for coherent, locally relevant strategies. The system also supports multilingual interactions, making it accessible to non-English-speaking farmers. Experiments on common agricultural queries related to climate adaptation show that, with additional tools and prompt refinement, AgroAskAI delivers more actionable, grounded, and inclusive outputs. Our experimental results highlight the potential of agentic AI for sustainable and accountable decision support in climate adaptation for agriculture.

### [6] [Beyond Accuracy: A Geometric Stability Analysis of Large Language Models in Chess Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15033)
*Xidan Song,Weiqi Wang,Ruifeng Cao,Qingya Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文指出传统大语言模型评估指标存在不足，提出几何稳定性框架评估模型，发现准确率 - 稳定性悖论，部分模型在几何扰动下表现差，强调几何稳定性是AI评估的重要指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型评估中，高准确率不代表有强大概念理解能力，标准准确性指标无法区分真推理和浅层记忆，需新评估方法。

Method: 提出几何稳定性框架，对包括GPT - 5.1等六个模型利用约3000个数据集进行对比分析。

Result: 存在准确率 - 稳定性悖论，像GPT - 5.1在标准位置准确率高但几何扰动下性能差，Claude Sonnet 4.5和Kimi K2 Turbo表现出双稳健性，Gemini 2.5 Flash在非法状态拒绝方面领先。

Conclusion: 几何稳定性是AI评估的重要正交指标，能区分推理能力和数据污染、过拟合问题。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning domains typically relies on performance alignment with ground-truth oracles. In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.

### [7] [LADY: Linear Attention for Autonomous Driving Efficiency without Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15038)
*Jihao Huang,Xi Xia,Zhiyuan Li,Tianle Liu,Jingke Wang,Junbo Chen,Tengju Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出用于端到端自动驾驶的全线性注意力生成模型LADY，在基准测试中表现出色，可部署在边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法在处理长时空序列时成本高，现有线性注意力架构缺乏跨模态和跨时间交互，无法满足自动驾驶需求。

Method: 提出LADY模型，可在推理时以恒定计算和内存成本融合长程时间上下文，引入轻量级线性交叉注意力机制实现跨模态信息交换。

Result: 在NAVSIM和Bench2Drive基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，具有恒定的时间和内存复杂度，提高了规划性能并显著降低了计算成本，且可在边缘设备上部署验证。

Conclusion: LADY模型在自动驾驶中具有良好的性能和实用性，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: End-to-end paradigms have demonstrated great potential for autonomous driving. Additionally, most existing methods are built upon Transformer architectures. However, transformers incur a quadratic attention cost, limiting their ability to model long spatial and temporal sequences-particularly on resource-constrained edge platforms. As autonomous driving inherently demands efficient temporal modeling, this challenge severely limits their deployment and real-time performance. Recently, linear attention mechanisms have gained increasing attention due to their superior spatiotemporal complexity. However, existing linear attention architectures are limited to self-attention, lacking support for cross-modal and cross-temporal interactions-both crucial for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose LADY, the first fully linear attention-based generative model for end-to-end autonomous driving. LADY enables fusion of long-range temporal context at inference with constant computational and memory costs, regardless of the history length of camera and LiDAR features. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight linear cross-attention mechanism that enables effective cross-modal information exchange. Experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that LADY achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant-time and memory complexity, offering improved planning performance and significantly reduced computational cost. Additionally, the model has been deployed and validated on edge devices, demonstrating its practicality in resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key development direction in the sixth-generation (6G) era, which provides essential support for the collaborative sensing and communication of future intelligent networks. However, as wireless environments become increasingly dynamic and complex, ISAC systems require more intelligent processing and more autonomous operation to maintain efficiency and adaptability. Meanwhile, agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a feasible solution to address these challenges by enabling continuous perception-reasoning-action loops in dynamic environments to support intelligent, autonomous, and efficient operation for ISAC systems. As such, we delve into the application value and prospects of agentic AI in ISAC systems in this work. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive review of agentic AI and ISAC systems to demonstrate their key characteristics. Secondly, we show several common optimization approaches for ISAC systems and highlight the significant advantages of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based agentic AI. Thirdly, we propose a novel agentic ISAC framework and prensent a case study to verify its superiority in optimizing ISAC performance. Finally, we clarify future research directions for agentic AI-based ISAC systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出受人类分层推理启发的框架CogER，根据查询难度选择合适推理策略，结合强化学习自动选策略并引入工具辅助推理，实验显示CogER优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型推理策略难在不同难度查询中平衡推理效率和准确性。

Method: 提出CogER框架，评估查询复杂度并分配到预定义级别，用强化学习训练CogER - Agent自动选策略，引入认知工具辅助推理。

Result: CogER在领域内任务平均精确匹配上相对提升至少13%，领域外任务相对提升8%。

Conclusion: CogER优于现有测试时间缩放方法，能更好地处理不同难度的查询。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks. However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.

Motivation: 动态变量排序启发式虽能收紧界限，但全局评估变量集时计算开销大，需缓解此权衡。

Result: 在基准实例上，相比标准动态变量排序基线，所提方法持续降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 基于聚类的变量排序框架有效减少离散优化计算开销。

Abstract: Efficient exact algorithms for Discrete Optimization (DO) rely heavily on strong primal and dual bounds. Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.

Abstract: The automated and intelligent processing of massive remote sensing (RS) datasets is critical in Earth observation (EO). Existing automated systems are normally task-specific, lacking a unified framework to manage diverse, end-to-end workflows--from data preprocessing to advanced interpretation--across diverse RS applications. To address this gap, this paper introduces CangLing-KnowFlow, a unified intelligent agent framework that integrates a Procedural Knowledge Base (PKB), Dynamic Workflow Adjustment, and an Evolutionary Memory Module. The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial. Across all complex tasks, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate. As the first most comprehensive validation along this emerging field, this research demonstrates the great potential of CangLing-KnowFlow as a robust, efficient, and scalable automated solution for complex EO challenges by leveraging expert knowledge (Knowledge) into adaptive and verifiable procedures (Flow).

Motivation: 现有控制器合成方法的探索策略依赖固定规则或仅考虑有限当前特征的RL方法，效率受限。

Method: 引入GCRL方法，将LTS探索历史编码为图结构，集成GNN增强基于RL的方法。

Result: 在对比实验中，除一个高对称和严格局部交互的特定领域外，GCRL在四个基准领域表现出更好的学习效率和泛化性。

Conclusion: GCRL方法能有效提升控制器合成的效率和泛化性，但在特定领域存在局限性。

Abstract: Controller synthesis is a formal method approach for automatically generating Labeled Transition System (LTS) controllers that satisfy specified properties. The efficiency of the synthesis process, however, is critically dependent on exploration policies. These policies often rely on fixed rules or strategies learned through reinforcement learning (RL) that consider only a limited set of current features. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GCRL, an approach that enhances RL-based methods by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GCRL encodes the history of LTS exploration into a graph structure, allowing it to capture a broader, non-current-based context. In a comparative experiment against state-of-the-art methods, GCRL exhibited superior learning efficiency and generalization across four out of five benchmark domains, except one particular domain characterized by high symmetry and strictly local interactions.

Abstract: The rapid development of Generative AI is bringing innovative changes to education and assessment. As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that "Perception Errors" were dominant, highlighting a "Perception-Cognition Gap" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a "Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy," successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and "Process Hallucination," where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing "AI-resistant questions" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）代理在处理大规模动态上下文时，静态提示缺乏有效管理机制，导致纠正和增强失败。

Method: 引入SCOPE方法，将上下文管理视为在线优化问题，通过执行轨迹合成指南自动演化代理提示；提出双流机制平衡战术特异性和战略通用性；引入视角驱动探索以最大化策略覆盖。

Result: 在HLE基准测试中，SCOPE将任务成功率从14.23%提高到38.64%，且无需人工干预。

Conclusion: SCOPE能有效解决大语言模型（LLM）代理在处理大规模动态上下文时的提示管理问题，提升任务成功率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in environments that generate massive, dynamic contexts. However, a critical bottleneck remains: while agents have access to this context, their static prompts lack the mechanisms to manage it effectively, leading to recurring Corrective and Enhancement failures. To address this capability gap, we introduce \textbf{SCOPE} (Self-evolving Context Optimization via Prompt Evolution). SCOPE frames context management as an \textit{online optimization} problem, synthesizing guidelines from execution traces to automatically evolve the agent's prompt. We propose a Dual-Stream mechanism that balances tactical specificity (resolving immediate errors) with strategic generality (evolving long-term principles). Furthermore, we introduce Perspective-Driven Exploration to maximize strategy coverage, increasing the likelihood that the agent has the correct strategy for any given task. Experiments on the HLE benchmark show that SCOPE improves task success rates from 14.23\% to 38.64\% without human intervention. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/SCOPE.

Conclusion: 自动化方法可用于支持牌类游戏中各种决策。

Abstract: In multi-player card games such as Skat or Bridge, the early stages of the game, such as bidding, game selection, and initial card selection, are often more critical to the success of the play than refined middle- and end-game play. At the current limits of computation, such early decision-making resorts to using statistical information derived from a large corpus of human expert games. In this paper, we derive and evaluate a general bootstrapping outer-learning framework that improves prediction accuracy by expanding the database of human games with millions of self-playing AI games to generate and merge statistics. We implement perfect feature hash functions to address compacted tables, producing a self-improving card game engine, where newly inferred knowledge is continuously improved during self-learning. The case study in Skat shows that the automated approach can be used to support various decisions in the game.

Result: 该集成框架能优化调度并透明支持人类输入。

Conclusion: 该系统为可解释的、自适应的UAM调度提供了强大结构。

Abstract: Due to the restricted resources, efficient scheduling in vertiports has received much more attention in the field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). For the scheduling problem, we utilize a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), which is often formulated in a resource-restricted project scheduling problem (RCPSP). In this paper, we show our approach to handle both dynamic operation requirements and vague rescheduling requests from humans. Particularly, we utilize a three-valued logic for interpreting ambiguous user intents and a decision tree, proposing a newly integrated system that combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) and MILP. This integrated framework optimizes schedules and supports human inputs transparently. With this system, we provide a robust structure for explainable, adaptive UAM scheduling.

Abstract: High-quality mathematical reasoning supervision requires diverse reasoning styles, long-form traces, and effective tool integration, capabilities that existing datasets provide only in limited form. Leveraging the multi-mode generation ability of gpt-oss-120b, we introduce Nemotron-Math, a large-scale mathematical reasoning dataset containing 7.5M solution traces across high, medium, and low reasoning modes, each available both with and without Python tool-integrated reasoning (TIR).
  The dataset integrates 85K curated AoPS problems with 262K community-sourced StackExchange-Math problems, combining structured competition tasks with diverse real-world mathematical queries. We conduct controlled evaluations to assess the dataset quality.
  Nemotron-Math consistently outperforms the original OpenMathReasoning on matched AoPS problems. Incorporating StackExchange-Math substantially improves robustness and generalization, especially on HLE-Math, while preserving accuracy on math competition benchmarks.
  To support efficient long-context training, we develop a sequential bucketed strategy that accelerates 128K context-length fine-tuning by 2--3$\times$ without significant accuracy loss. Overall, Nemotron-Math enables state-of-the-art performance, including 100\% maj@16 accuracy on AIME 2024 and 2025 with Python TIR.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific "superintelligence". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，STC展现出强大的批判性思维能力，产生更易解释的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: STC代表了向具有内置批判性思维的大语言模型迈进的一步。

Abstract: Human beings solve complex problems through critical thinking, where reasoning and evaluation are intertwined to converge toward correct solutions. However, most existing large language models (LLMs) decouple reasoning from verification: they either generate reasoning without explicit self-checking or rely on external verifiers to detect errors post hoc. The former lacks immediate feedback, while the latter increases system complexity and hinders synchronized learning. Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities and produces more interpretable reasoning traces, representing a step toward LLMs with built-in critical thinking.

Result: 在多模型、数据集、指标和方法上，CAGE提升了上下文归因忠实度，平均增益达40%。

Conclusion: CAGE框架有效克服了现有上下文归因方法的不足，提高了归因忠实度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet their reasoning remains opaque, raising safety and trust concerns. Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.

Abstract: Interpreting the internal activations of neural networks can produce more faithful explanations of their behavior, but is difficult due to the complex structure of activation space. Existing approaches to scalable interpretability use hand-designed agents that make and test hypotheses about how internal activations relate to external behavior. We propose to instead turn this task into an end-to-end training objective, by training interpretability assistants to accurately predict model behavior from activations through a communication bottleneck. Specifically, an encoder compresses activations to a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder reads this list and answers a natural language question about the model. We show how to pretrain this assistant on large unstructured data, then finetune it to answer questions. The resulting architecture, which we call a Predictive Concept Decoder, enjoys favorable scaling properties: the auto-interp score of the bottleneck concepts improves with data, as does the performance on downstream applications. Specifically, PCDs can detect jailbreaks, secret hints, and implanted latent concepts, and are able to accurately surface latent user attributes.

Result: GNN性能与基准随机森林相当。

Conclusion: 为从传统ML向先进AI架构过渡提供基础，为未来多模态和物理信息GNN模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly applied in concrete research to optimize performance and mixture design. However, one major challenge in applying ML to cementitious materials is the limited size and diversity of available databases. A promising solution is the development of multi-modal databases that integrate both numerical and graphical data. Conventional ML frameworks in cement research are typically restricted to a single data modality. Graph neural network (GNN) represents a new generation of neural architectures capable of learning from data structured as graphs, capturing relationships through irregular or topology-dependent connections rather than fixed spatial coordinates. While GNN is inherently designed for graphical data, they can be adapted to extract correlations from numerical datasets and potentially embed physical laws directly into their architecture, enabling explainable and physics-informed predictions. This work is among the first few studies to implement GNNs to design concrete, with a particular emphasis on establishing a clear and reproducible pathway for converting tabular data into graph representations using the k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) approach. Model hyperparameters and feature selection are systematically optimized to enhance prediction performance. The GNN shows performance comparable to the benchmark random forest, which has been demonstrated by many studies to yield reliable predictions for cementitious materials. Overall, this study provides a foundational roadmap for transitioning from traditional ML to advanced AI architectures. The proposed framework establishes a strong foundation for future multi-modal and physics-informed GNN models capable of capturing complex material behaviors and accelerating the design and optimization of cementitious materials.

Abstract: Proteins inherently possess a consistent sequence-structure duality. The abundance of protein sequence data, which can be readily represented as discrete tokens, has driven fruitful developments in protein language models (pLMs). A key remaining challenge, however, is how to effectively integrate continuous structural knowledge into pLMs. Current methods often discretize protein structures to accommodate the language modeling framework, which inevitably results in the loss of fine-grained information and limits the performance potential of multimodal pLMs. In this paper, we argue that such concerns can be circumvented: a sequence-based pLM can be extended to incorporate the structure modality through continuous tokens, i.e., high-fidelity protein structure latents that avoid vector quantization. Specifically, we propose a hybrid diffusion protein language model, HD-Prot, which embeds a continuous-valued diffusion head atop a discrete pLM, enabling seamless operation with both discrete and continuous tokens for joint sequence-structure modeling. It captures inter-token dependencies across modalities through a unified absorbing diffusion process, and estimates per-token distributions via categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures. Extensive empirical results show that HD-Prot achieves competitive performance in unconditional sequence-structure co-generation, motif-scaffolding, protein structure prediction, and inverse folding tasks, performing on par with state-of-the-art multimodal pLMs despite being developed under limited computational resources. It highlights the viability of simultaneously estimating categorical and continuous distributions within a unified language model architecture, offering a promising alternative direction for multimodal pLMs.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of bacterial biofilm growth is essential for understanding their complex dynamics in biomedical, environmental, and industrial settings. These dynamics are shaped by a variety of environmental influences, including the presence of antibiotics, nutrient availability, and inter-species interactions, all of which affect species-specific growth rates. However, capturing this behavior in computational models is challenging due to the presence of hybrid uncertainties, a combination of epistemic uncertainty (stemming from incomplete knowledge about model parameters) and aleatory uncertainty (reflecting inherent biological variability and stochastic environmental conditions). In this work, we present a Bayesian model updating (BMU) framework to calibrate a recently introduced multi-species biofilm growth model. To enable efficient inference in the presence of hybrid uncertainties, we construct a reduced-order model (ROM) derived using the Time-Separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM) approach. TSM allows for an efficient propagation of aleatory uncertainty, which enables single-loop Bayesian inference, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive nested (double-loop) schemes typically required in hybrid uncertainty quantification. The BMU framework employs a likelihood function constructed from the mean and variance of stochastic model outputs, enabling robust parameter calibration even under sparse and noisy data. We validate our approach through two case studies: a two-species and a four-species biofilm model. Both demonstrate that our method not only accurately recovers the underlying model parameters but also provides predictive responses consistent with the synthetic data.

Motivation: 构建可靠CKM需大量数据和计算，动态环境中预建CKM会过时，频繁重新训练有浪费，存在CKM效能和更新开销的权衡问题。

Method: 引入地图效能函数（MEF），将更新调度问题转化为分数规划，开发基于Dinkelbach的Delta - P和Delta - L算法，针对不可预测和可预测环境分别制定策略。

Result: Delta - P保证全局最优，Delta - L有近线性复杂度且接近最优性能，得出不同环境下的更新策略。

Conclusion: 更强的进入损失和更快的衰减利于立即更新，较弱的进入损失和较慢的衰减利于延迟更新。

Abstract: The Channel Knowledge Map (CKM) maps position information to channel state information, leveraging environmental knowledge to reduce signaling overhead in sixth-generation networks. However, constructing a reliable CKM demands substantial data and computation, and in dynamic environments, a pre-built CKM becomes outdated, degrading performance. Frequent retraining restores accuracy but incurs significant waste, creating a fundamental trade-off between CKM efficacy and update overhead. To address this, we introduce a Map Efficacy Function (MEF) capturing both gradual aging and abrupt environmental transitions, and formulate the update scheduling problem as fractional programming. We develop two Dinkelbach-based algorithms: Delta-P guarantees global optimality, while Delta-L achieves near-optimal performance with near-linear complexity. For unpredictable environments, we derive a threshold-based policy: immediate updates are optimal when the environmental degradation rate exceeds the resource consumption acceleration; otherwise, delay is preferable. For predictable environments, long-term strategies strategically relax these myopic rules to maximize global performance. Across this regime, the policy reveals that stronger entry loss and faster decay favor immediate updates, while weaker entry loss and slower decay favor delayed updates.

Abstract: Cancer research has shifted from a purely gene-centric view to a more holistic understanding that recognizes the critical role of the tumour microenvironment, where mechanics and metabolism are key drivers of disease progression. However, the intricate interplay between these multifactorial mechanisms remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we present an agent-based computational model (ABM) that integrates tumour metabolism and mechanics to study 3D cancer spheroid growth. Our approach unifies the metabolism and mechanical aspects of tumour development within an integral model for cancer spheroid formation and growth. In addition to that, we performed a computational calibration of the parameters and tested the model versatility to reproduce different cellular behaviours. Our model reproduced qualitatively and quantitatively the experimental results of spheroid growth obtained in the lab and also allowed to discern different dynamics that cancer cells can present under the same conditions, providing insight into the potential factors contributing to the variability in the size of spheroids. Furthermore, it also showed its adaptability to reproduce diferent cell lines and behaviours by tuning its parameters. This study highlights the significant potential and versatility of integrative modelling approaches in the field of cancer research, not only as a tool to complement in vitro studies, but also as independent tools to derive conclusions from the physical reality.

Abstract: Reliable forward uncertainty quantification in engineering requires methods that account for aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出支持查询通道即席选择的 MS - Index 算法用于 MTS 子序列搜索，在 34 个数据集上表现优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中，并非 MTS 的所有通道都与查询相关，需在查询时指定相关通道。

Method: 引入 MS - Index 算法进行欧几里得距离下的最近邻 MTS 子序列搜索。

Result: 算法准确，查询性能与查询通道数量呈亚线性关系；在 34 个数据集上的实验表明，其对原始和归一化子序列的性能比现有技术高 1 - 2 个数量级。

Conclusion: MS - Index 算法在多变量时间序列子序列搜索中效果良好，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Modern applications frequently collect and analyze temporal data in the form of multivariate time series (MTS) -- time series that contain multiple channels. A common task in this context is subsequence search, which involves identifying all MTS that contain subsequences highly similar to a query time series. In practical scenarios, not all channels of an MTS are relevant to every query. For instance, airplane sensors may gather data on a plethora of components and subsystems, but only a few of these are relevant to a specific query, such as identifying the cause of a malfunctioning landing gear, or a specific flight maneuver. Consequently, the relevant query channels are often specified at query time. In this work, we introduce the Multivariate Subsequence Index (MS-Index), a novel algorithm for nearest neighbor MTS subsequence search under Euclidean distance that supports ad-hoc selection of query channels. The algorithm is exact and demonstrates query performance that scales sublinearly to the number of query channels. We examine the properties of \name with a thorough experimental evaluation over 34 datasets, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art one to two orders of magnitude for both raw and normalized subsequences.

Conclusion: 所提方法可用于属性图节点比较，不同启发式方法适用于不同需求。

Abstract: While scoring nodes in graphs to understand their importance (e.g., in terms of centrality) has been investigated for decades, comparing nodes in property graphs based on their properties has not, to our knowledge, yet been addressed. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically extract comparison of nodes in property graphs, to support the interactive exploratory analysis of said graphs. We first present a way of devising comparison indicators using the context of nodes to be compared. Then, we formally define the problem of using these indicators to group the nodes so that the comparisons extracted are both significant and not straightforward. We propose various heuristics for solving this problem. Our tests on real property graph databases show that simple heuristics can be used to obtain insights within minutes while slower heuristics are needed to obtain insights of higher quality.

Motivation: 为有向带标签多重图如RDF图引入新的关联规则，支持生成和评估任务，且超越现有相关形式体系。

Method: 在无重复语义下评估图模式，定义概率空间，推导概率设置下的置信度、提升度等指标并分析其与经典指标的关系。

Result: 完成了图模式评估、概率空间定义及指标推导和分析。

Conclusion: GPARs有其独特优势，可有效考虑图的拓扑结构，且部分指标特性在特定条件下能得以保留。

Abstract: We introduce graph pattern-based association rules (GPARs) for directed labeled multigraphs such as RDF graphs. GPARs support both generative tasks, where a graph is extended, and evaluative tasks, where the plausibility of a graph is assessed. The framework goes beyond related formalisms such as graph functional dependencies, graph entity dependencies, relational association rules, graph association rules, multi-relation and path association rules, and Horn rules. Given a collection of graphs, we evaluate graph patterns under no-repeated-anything semantics, which allows the topology of a graph to be taken into account more effectively. We define a probability space and derive confidence, lift, leverage, and conviction in a probabilistic setting. We further analyze how these metrics relate to their classical itemset-based counterparts and identify conditions under which their characteristic properties are preserved.

Motivation: 现有数据集搜索系统在基于高级任务描述搜索数据集时面临用户意图模糊、任务到数据集映射和基准差距、实体歧义等挑战。

Method: 构建KATS系统，包括离线知识库构建（用协作多智能体框架构建任务 - 数据集知识图谱）和在线查询处理（用混合查询引擎），使用语义机制处理实体歧义，引入CS - TDS基准套件。

Result: 在基准套件上的实验表明，KATS在有效性和效率上显著优于现有检索增强生成框架。

Conclusion: KATS为下一代数据集发现系统提供了强大蓝图。

Abstract: The search for suitable datasets is the critical "first step" in data-driven research, but it remains a great challenge. Researchers often need to search for datasets based on high-level task descriptions. However, existing search systems struggle with this task due to ambiguous user intent, task-to-dataset mapping and benchmark gaps, and entity ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce KATS, a novel end-to-end system for task-oriented dataset search from unstructured scientific literature. KATS consists of two key components, i.e., offline knowledge base construction and online query processing. The sophisticated offline pipeline automatically constructs a high-quality, dynamically updatable task-dataset knowledge graph by employing a collaborative multi-agent framework for information extraction, thereby filling the task-to-dataset mapping gap. To further address the challenge of entity ambiguity, a unique semantic-based mechanism is used for task entity linking and dataset entity resolution. For online retrieval, KATS utilizes a specialized hybrid query engine that combines vector search with graph-based ranking to generate highly relevant results. Additionally, we introduce CS-TDS, a tailored benchmark suite for evaluating task-oriented dataset search systems, addressing the critical gap in standardized evaluation. Experiments on our benchmark suite show that KATS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented generation frameworks in both effectiveness and efficiency, providing a robust blueprint for the next generation of dataset discovery systems.

Motivation: 传统研究数据管理生态系统中的搜索应用需用户提交基于关键词的查询，而使用领域特定大语言模型进行自然语言处理的任务越来越普遍。

Method: 提出ArcBERT系统，依靠语义匹配理解自然语言查询，同时理解元数据结构和层次。

Result: 未提及具体研究结果。

Conclusion: 未明确给出结论，但表明ArcBERT可有效处理多样的用户查询模式。

Abstract: Traditional search applications within Research Data Management (RDM) ecosystems are crucial in helping users discover and explore the structured metadata from the research datasets. Typically, text search engines require users to submit keyword-based queries rather than using natural language. However, using Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on domain-specific content for specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks is becoming increasingly common. We present ArcBERT, an LLM-based system designed for integrated metadata exploration. ArcBERT understands natural language queries and relies on semantic matching, unlike traditional search applications. Notably, ArcBERT also understands the structure and hierarchies within the metadata, enabling it to handle diverse user querying patterns effectively.

Motivation: 传统以网络为中心的高性能数据传输观点不完整，需全面研究影响数据移动能力的因素。

Method: 研究六种常见范式，用具备延迟仿真能力的测试台验证结果，并进行从资源受限边缘环境到100Gbps运营链路的大量生产测量。

Result: 主要瓶颈常不在网络核心，软硬件协同设计能确保不同速率数据传输的一致性能。

Conclusion: 软硬件协同设计方法可缩小基准测试结果与复杂生产环境之间的差距。

Abstract: The pursuit of high-performance data transfer often focuses on raw network bandwidth, and international links of 100 Gbps or higher are frequently considered the primary enabler. While necessary, this network-centric view is incomplete, equating provisioned link speeds with practical, sustainable data movement capabilities across the entire edge-to-core spectrum. This paper investigates six common paradigms, from the often-cited constraints of network latency and TCP congestion control algorithms to host-side factors such as CPU performance and virtualization that critically impact data movement workflows. We validated our findings using a latency-emulation-capable testbed for high-speed WAN performance prediction and through extensive production measurements from resource-constrained edge environments to a 100 Gbps operational link connecting Switzerland and California, U.S. These results show that the principal bottlenecks often reside outside the network core, and that a holistic hardware-software co-design ensures consistent performance, whether moving data at 1 Gbps or 100 Gbps and faster. This approach effectively closes the fidelity gap between benchmark results and diverse and complex production environments.

Motivation: 在内存有限、通信慢的普通GPU上进行中型语言模型训练。

Method: 采用激活检查点、卸载和基于复制引擎的集合等优化方法。

Result: 能在单张16GB中端游戏卡上训练或微调7B模型，在4张RTX 4090的工作站上训练32B模型，维持约50%的FLOP利用率。

Conclusion: LLMQ效率可与更昂贵云级GPU上的生产级系统相媲美。

Abstract: We present LLMQ, an end-to-end CUDA/C++ implementation for medium-sized language-model training, e.g. 3B to 32B parameters, on affordable, commodity GPUs. These devices are characterized by low memory availability and slow communication compared to datacentre-grade GPUs. Consequently, we showcase a range of optimizations that target these bottlenecks, including activation checkpointing, offloading, and copy-engine based collectives. LLMQ is able to train or fine-tune a 7B model on a single 16GB mid-range gaming card, or a 32B model on a workstation equipped with 4 RTX 4090s. This is achieved while executing a standard 8-bit training pipeline, without additional algorithmic approximations, and maintaining FLOP utilization of around 50%. The efficiency of LLMQ rivals that of production-scale systems on much more expensive cloud-grade GPUs.

Result: 优化点组合影响吞吐量，优化设计克服速度与精度权衡，在等错误率下性能远超现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出模块化CUDA/C++实现，有望加速Bloom过滤器在GPU上的应用。

Abstract: Bloom filters are a fundamental data structure for approximate membership queries, with applications ranging from data analytics to databases and genomics. Several variants have been proposed to accommodate parallel architectures. GPUs, with massive thread-level parallelism and high-bandwidth memory, are a natural fit for accelerating these Bloom filter variants potentially to billions of operations per second. Although CPU-optimized implementations have been well studied, GPU designs remain underexplored. We close this gap by exploring the design space on GPUs along three dimensions: vectorization, thread cooperation, and compute latency.
  Our evaluation shows that the combination of these optimization points strongly affects throughput, with the largest gains achieved when the filter fits within the GPU's cache domain. We examine how the hardware responds to different parameter configurations and relate these observations to measured performance trends. Crucially, our optimized design overcomes the conventional trade-off between speed and precision, delivering the throughput typically restricted to high-error variants while maintaining the superior accuracy of high-precision configurations. At iso error rate, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by $11.35\times$ ($15.4\times$) for bulk filter lookup (construction), respectively, achieving above $92\%$ of the practical speed-of-light across a wide range of configurations on a B200 GPU. We propose a modular CUDA/C++ implementation, which will be openly available soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Raft系统在保证读一致性时，安全检查通信开销高，现有租约协议指定模糊且影响可用性，多数系统实现不正确或未实现。

Method: 引入依赖Raft选举特性的LeaseGuard算法，用TLA+严格指定，包含两个优化，并用Python模拟和在LogCabin中实现进行评估。

Result: 将一致性读开销从一次网络往返减少到零，写吞吐量从每秒约1000次提高到约10000次，新领导者能让99%的读立即成功。

Conclusion: LeaseGuard算法能有效降低开销、提高吞吐量和可用性。

Abstract: Raft is a leading consensus algorithm for replicating writes in distributed databases. However, distributed databases also require consistent reads. To guarantee read consistency, a Raft-based system must either accept the high communication overhead of a safety check for each read, or implement leader leases. Prior lease protocols are vaguely specified and hurt availability, so most Raft systems implement them incorrectly or not at all. We introduce LeaseGuard, a novel lease algorithm that relies on guarantees specific to Raft elections. LeaseGuard is simple, rigorously specified in TLA+, and includes two novel optimizations that maximize availability during leader failover. The first optimization restores write throughput quickly, and the second improves read availability. We evaluate LeaseGuard with a simulation in Python and an implementation in LogCabin, the C++ reference implementation of Raft. By replacing LogCabin's default consistency mechanism (quorum checks), LeaseGuard reduces the overhead of consistent reads from one to zero network roundtrips. It also improves write throughput from ~1000 to ~10,000 writes per second, by eliminating contention between writes and quorum reads. Whereas traditional leases ban all reads on a new leader while it waits for a lease, in our LeaseGuard test the new leader instantly allows 99% of reads to succeed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统批处理框架不适用于Early - Exit大语言模型，现有解决方案存在忽视退出机会或降低输出质量的问题。

Method: 提出Dynamic Rebatching动态重组批次，实现DREX系统，包含无复制重组缓冲区、EE和SLA感知调度器，用内存高效状态复制处理跳过层的缺失KV缓存。

Result: DREX相比基线方法提升2 - 12%吞吐量，保持输出质量，消除非自愿退出。

Conclusion: DREX能有效解决传统批处理框架对Early - Exit大语言模型的适配问题，保证输出质量。

Abstract: Early-Exit (EE) is a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that accelerates inference by allowing easier tokens to be generated using only a subset of the model's layers. However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the same time. Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable. DREX also efficiently handles the missing KV cache from skipped layers using memory-efficient state-copying. Our evaluation shows that DREX improves throughput by 2-12% compared to baseline approaches while maintaining output quality. Crucially, DREX completely eliminates involuntary exits, providing a key guarantee for preserving the output quality intended by the EE model.

Result: 通过实验评估验证了所提方法在真实数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能有效解决标签一致的k - 中心问题，在更新聚类解时保证了一致性。

Abstract: Data analysis often involves an iterative process, where solutions must be continuously refined in response to new data. Typically, as new data becomes available, an existing solution must be updated to incorporate the latest information. In addition to seeking a high-quality solution for the task at hand, it is also crucial to ensure consistency by minimizing drastic changes from previous solutions. Applying this approach across many iterations, ensures that the solution evolves gradually and smoothly.
  In this paper, we study the above problem in the context of clustering, specifically focusing on the $k$-center problem. More precisely, we study the following problem: Given a set of points $X$, parameters $k$ and $b$, and a prior clustering solution $H$ for $X$, our goal is to compute a new solution $C$ for $X$, consisting of $k$ centers, which minimizes the clustering cost while introducing at most $b$ changes from $H$. We refer to this problem as label-consistent $k$-center, and we propose two constant-factor approximation algorithms for it. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods on real-world datasets.

### [41] [A Constant-Factor Approximation for Directed Latency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15473)

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the Directed Latency problem, we are given an asymmetric metric on a set of vertices (or clients), and a given depot $s$. We seek a path $P$ starting at $s$ and visiting all the clients so as to minimize the sum of client waiting times (also known as latency) before being visited on the path.
  In contrast to the symmetric version of this problem (also known as the Deliveryperson problem and the Repairperson problem in the literature), there are significant gaps in our understanding of Directed Latency. The best approximation factor has remained at $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of clients, for more than a decade [Friggstad, Salavatipour, and Svitkina, '13]. Only recently, [Friggstad and Swamy, '22] presented a constant-factor approximation but in quasi-polynomial time. Both results follow similar ideas: they consider buckets with geometrically-increasing distances, build paths in each bucket, and then stitch together all these paths to get a feasible solution. [Friggstad and Swamy, '22] showed if we guess a vertex from each bucket and augment a standard LP relaxation with these guesses, then one can reduce the stitching cost. Unfortunately, there are logarithmically many buckets so the running time of their algorithm is quasi-polynomial.
  In this paper, we present the first constant-factor approximation for Directed Latency in polynomial time by introducing a completely new way of bucketing which helps us strengthen a standard LP relaxation with less aggressive guessing. Although the resulting LP is no longer a relaxation of Directed Latency, it still admits a good solution. We present a rounding algorithm for fractional solutions of our LP, crucially exploiting the way we restricted the feasibility region of the LP formulation.

Conclusion: JEANet作为首个将全局外部性融入联合拍卖的AMD方法，能动态适应多方广告商投标特征，实现联合和传统广告统一拍卖。

Abstract: Recently, joint advertising has gained significant attention as an effective approach to enhancing the efficiency and revenue of advertising slot allocation. Unlike traditional advertising, which allocates advertising slots exclusively to a single advertiser, joint advertising displays advertisements from brands and stores that have established a joint selling relationship within the same advertising slot. However, existing approaches often struggle to accommodate both joint and traditional advertising frameworks, thereby limiting the revenue potential and generalizability of joint advertising. Furthermore, these methods are constrained by two critical limitations: they generally neglect the influence of global externalities, and they fail to address the bidding variability stemming from multi-party advertiser participation. Collectively, these limitations present substantial challenges to the design of joint auction mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose a Joint Auction Framework incorporating Externalities and Adaptation, and leverage the automated mechanism design (AMD) method through our proposed JEANet to compute joint auction mechanisms that satisfy the conditions of individual rationality (IR) and approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). As the first AMD method to integrate global externalities into joint auctions, JEANet dynamically adapts to the bidding characteristics of multi-party advertiser and enables unified auctions that integrate both joint and traditional advertising. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that JEANet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in multi-slot joint auctions.

Conclusion: 该方法补充了现有探索技术，为大规模展示探索性内容引入可部署、基于行为的机制，无偏数据对推荐系统有价值。

Abstract: Exploration is essential to improve long-term recommendation quality, but it often degrades short-term business performance, especially in remote-first TV environments where users engage passively, expect instant relevance, and offer few chances for correction. This paper introduces an approach for delivering content-level exploration safely and efficiently by optimizing its placement based on reach and opportunity cost. Deployed on a large-scale streaming platform with over 100 million monthly active users, our approach identifies scroll-depth regions with lower engagement and strategically introduces a dedicated container, the "Something Completely Different" row containing randomized content. Rather than enforcing exploration uniformly across the user interface (UI), we condition its appearance on empirically low-cost, high-reach positions to ensure minimal tradeoff against platform-level watch time goals. Extensive A/B testing shows that this strategy preserves business metrics while collecting unbiased interaction data. Our method complements existing intra-row diversification and bandit-based exploration techniques by introducing a deployable, behaviorally informed mechanism for surfacing exploratory content at scale. Moreover, we demonstrate that the collected unbiased data, integrated into downstream candidate generation, significantly improves user engagement, validating its value for recommender systems.

Method: 提出ICAR，采用双路径训练解决跨模态对齐问题；开发ConvNeXt - IC将图像复杂度评估作为分类任务。

Result: ConvNeXt - IC达到了与人类判断0.959的相关性，有4.4倍加速；ICAR实现20%实际加速，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: ICAR能有效使视觉语言系统进行可持续扩展。

Abstract: Vision transformers in vision-language models apply uniform computational effort across all images, expending 175.33 GFLOPs (ViT-L/14) whether analysing a straightforward product photograph or a complex street scene. We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% practical speedup while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems.

Abstract: We present MedNuggetizer, https://mednugget-ai.de/; access is available upon request.}, a tool for query-driven extraction and clustering of information nuggets from medical documents to support clinicians in exploring underlying medical evidence. Backed by a large language model (LLM), \textit{MedNuggetizer} performs repeated extractions of information nuggets that are then grouped to generate reliable evidence within and across multiple documents. We demonstrate its utility on the clinical use case of \textit{antibiotic prophylaxis before prostate biopsy} by using major urological guidelines and recent PubMed studies as sources of information. Evaluation by domain experts shows that \textit{MedNuggetizer} provides clinicians and researchers with an efficient way to explore long documents and easily extract reliable, query-focused medical evidence.

Conclusion: 考虑分类和图像数据可提高推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Every day, a significant number of users visit the internet for different needs. The owners of a website generate profits from the user interaction with the contents or items of the website. A robust recommendation system can increase user interaction with a website by recommending items according to the user's unique preferences. BERT and CNN-integrated neural collaborative filtering (NCF) have been proposed for the recommendation system in this experiment. The proposed model takes inputs from the user and item profile and finds the user's interest. This model can handle numeric, categorical, and image data to extract the latent features from the inputs. The model is trained and validated on a small sample of the MovieLens dataset for 25 epochs. The same dataset has been used to train and validate a simple NCF and a BERT-based NCF model and compared with the proposed model. The proposed model outperformed those two baseline models. The obtained result for the proposed model is 0.72 recall and 0.486 Hit Ratio @ 10 for 799 users on the MovieLens dataset. This experiment concludes that considering both categorical and image data can improve the performance of a recommendation system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经架构搜索需大量人力专业知识或反复试验，旨在提出新的高效搜索方法。

Method: 使用DeepSeek - R1 - 0528 - Qwen3 - 8B作为主要生成器，在严格Net API下，将LEMUR分类骨干的CNN编码器与序列解码器组合生成模型，用提示模板和示例生成架构，在MS COCO上用BLEU - 4评估。

Conclusion: LLM引导的NAS有前景，不仅能提出架构，还能建议超参数和训练方法，通过提示规则和迭代代码修复解决了一些挑战，添加新模型助力可重复基准测试和下游研究。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) traditionally requires significant human expertise or automated trial-and-error to design deep learning models. We present NN-Caption, an LLM-guided neural architecture search pipeline that generates runnable image-captioning models by composing CNN encoders from LEMUR's classification backbones with sequence decoders (LSTM/GRU/Transformer) under a strict Net API. Using DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as the primary generator, we present the prompt template and examples of generated architectures. We evaluate on MS COCO with BLEU-4. The LLM generated dozens of captioning models, with over half successfully trained and producing meaningful captions. We analyse the outcomes of using different numbers of input model snippets (5 vs. 10) in the prompt, finding a slight drop in success rate when providing more candidate components. We also report training dynamics (caption accuracy vs. epochs) and the highest BLEU-4 attained. Our results highlight the promise of LLM-guided NAS: the LLM not only proposes architectures but also suggests hyperparameters and training practices. We identify the challenges encountered (e.g., code hallucinations or API compliance issues) and detail how prompt rules and iterative code fixes addressed them. This work presents a pipeline that integrates prompt-based code generation with automatic evaluation, and adds dozens of novel captioning models to the open LEMUR dataset to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and downstream AutoML research.

Conclusion: 所提出的AutoS方法能有效从大量源域中选择可迁移知识，提升目标任务预测效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-domain adaptation plays a key role in transfer learning by leveraging acquired rich source information from multiple source domains to solve target task from an unlabeled target domain. However, multiple source domains often contain much redundant or unrelated information which can harm transfer performance, especially when in massive-source domain settings. It is urgent to develop effective strategies for identifying and selecting the most transferable knowledge from massive source domains to address the target task. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain adaptation method named \underline{\textit{Auto}}nomous Source Knowledge \underline{\textit{S}}election (AutoS) to autonomosly select source training samples and models, enabling the prediction of target task using more relevant and transferable source information. The proposed method employs a density-driven selection strategy to choose source samples during training and to determine which source models should contribute to target prediction. Simulteneously, a pseudo-label enhancement module built on a pre-trained multimodal modal is employed to mitigate target label noise and improve self-supervision. Experiments on real-world datasets indicate the superiority of the proposed method.

Method: 进行End - to - End Deep Fusion和Context - Aware Stacking架构对比，提出SepsisFusionFormer和SepsisLateFusion模型，用CatBoost元学习器动态门控模态，采用多模态集成。

Result: SepsisFusionFormer在小抗生素队列过拟合（AUC 0.66），SepsisLateFusion预测提前4小时AUC达0.915，校准阈值后漏诊率降48%，多模态集成在抗生素选择任务AUC达0.72。

Conclusion: SepsisLateFusion和多模态集成表现优异，成果集成到SepsisSuite框架可用于临床决策支持。

Abstract: Sepsis accounts for nearly 20% of global ICU admissions, yet conventional prediction models often fail to effectively integrate heterogeneous data streams, remaining either siloed by modality or reliant on brittle early fusion. In this work, we present a rigorous architectural comparison between End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking for sepsis tasks. We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from "attention starvation" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a "leaner" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the "Historian" (Static), the "Monitor" (Temporal), and the "Reader" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC). These models are integrated into SepsisSuite, a deployment-ready Python framework for clinical decision support.

Conclusion: 所提方法可有效求解带公共噪声的MV - FBSDEs，适用于复杂模型，可引出性框架有灵活性。

Abstract: We present a novel numerical method for solving McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) with common noise, combining Picard iterations, elicitability and deep learning. The key innovation involves elicitability to derive a path-wise loss function, enabling efficient training of neural networks to approximate both the backward process and the conditional expectations arising from common noise - without requiring computationally expensive nested Monte Carlo simulations. The mean-field interaction term is parameterized via a recurrent neural network trained to minimize an elicitable score, while the backward process is approximated through a feedforward network representing the decoupling field. We validate the algorithm on a systemic risk inter-bank borrowing and lending model, where analytical solutions exist, demonstrating accurate recovery of the true solution. We further extend the model to quantile-mediated interactions, showcasing the flexibility of the elicitability framework beyond conditional means or moments. Finally, we apply the method to a non-stationary Aiyagari--Bewley--Huggett economic growth model with endogenous interest rates, illustrating its applicability to complex mean-field games without closed-form solutions.

Result: 识别出三类个体，第一类有上下文依赖偏好和特定情境剥削倾向；第二类坚持剥削策略；第三类采用探索策略并结合特定情境偏好。

Conclusion: LCRL模型可有效捕捉出行决策中个体的经验形成和异质性现象。

Abstract: Many travel decisions involve a degree of experience formation, where individuals learn their preferences over time. At the same time, there is extensive scope for heterogeneity across individual travellers, both in their underlying preferences and in how these evolve. The present paper puts forward a Latent Class Reinforcement Learning (LCRL) model that allows analysts to capture both of these phenomena. We apply the model to a driving simulator dataset and estimate the parameters through Variational Bayes. We identify three distinct classes of individuals that differ markedly in how they adapt their preferences: the first displays context-dependent preferences with context-specific exploitative tendencies; the second follows a persistent exploitative strategy regardless of context; and the third engages in an exploratory strategy combined with context-specific preferences.

Abstract: Remotely detecting and classifying underwater acoustic targets is critical for environmental monitoring and defence. However, the complex nature of ship-radiated and environmental underwater noise poses significant challenges to accurate signal processing. While recent advancements in machine learning have improved classification accuracy, issues such as limited dataset availability and a lack of standardised experimentation hinder generalisation and robustness. This paper introduces GSE ResNeXt, a deep learning architecture integrating learnable Gabor convolutional layers with a ResNeXt backbone enhanced by squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms. The Gabor filters serve as two-dimensional adaptive band-pass filters, extending the feature channel representation. Its combination with channel attention improves training stability and convergence while enhancing the model's ability to extract discriminative features. The model is evaluated on three classification tasks of increasing complexity. In particular, the impact of temporal differences between the training and testing data is explored, revealing that the distance between the vessel and sensor significantly affects performance. Results show that, GSE ResNeXt consistently outperforms baseline models like Xception, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, in terms of classification performance. Regarding stability and convergence, the addition of Gabor convolutions in the initial layers of the model represents a 28% reduction in training time. These results emphasise the importance of signal processing strategies in improving the reliability and generalisation of models under different environmental conditions, especially in data-limited underwater acoustic classification scenarios. Future developments should focus on mitigating the impact of environmental factors on input signals.

Abstract: Hard-to-detect hardware bit flips, from either malicious circuitry or bugs, have already been shown to make transformers vulnerable in non-generative tasks. This work, for the first time, investigates how low-level, bitwise perturbations (fault injection) to the weights of a large language model (LLM) used for image captioning can influence the semantic meaning of its generated descriptions while preserving grammatical structure. While prior fault analysis methods have shown that flipping a few bits can crash classifiers or degrade accuracy, these approaches overlook the semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. In image captioning models, a single flipped bit might subtly alter how visual features map to words, shifting the entire narrative an AI tells about the world. We hypothesize that such semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable. That is, the model's own gradients can predict which bits, if perturbed, will most strongly influence meaning while leaving syntax and fluency intact. We design a differentiable fault analysis framework, BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation), that uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits and then refines their selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. Our goal is not merely to corrupt captions, but to understand how meaning itself is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level, revealing that even imperceptible low-level changes can steer the high-level semantics of generative vision-language models. It also opens pathways for robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI, by exposing how structured bit-level faults can reshape a model's semantic output.

Motivation: 核方法如Rocket在所有数据集上表现不一，利用不同表示的互补结构来提升性能。

Method: 引入Fusion - 3框架融合Rocket、Sax和Sfa表示；用元特征将UCR数据集聚类；结合非参数配对统计、消融研究和SHAP归因分析。

Result: F3在有结构变异性或丰富频率内容的数据集上表现优于基线；在UCR数据集上比Rocket有稳定小提升，有明确失败案例。

Conclusion: 选择性融合是对强核方法可靠且可解释的扩展，能在数据支持的地方修正其弱点。

Abstract: Kernel-based methods such as Rocket are among the most effective default approaches for univariate time series classification (TSC), yet they do not perform equally well across all datasets. We revisit the long-standing intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and show that selectively fusing them can yield consistent improvements over Rocket on specific, systematically identifiable kinds of datasets. We introduce Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations. To understand when fusion helps, we cluster UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features capturing series length, spectral structure, roughness, and class imbalance, and treat these clusters as interpretable data-structure regimes. Our analysis shows that fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. To support these findings, we combine three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics across datasets, ablation studies isolating the roles of individual representations, and attribution via SHAP to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains. Sample-level case studies further reveal the underlying mechanism: fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors, with adaptive increases in frequency-domain weighting precisely where corrections occur. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the 113 UCR datasets, F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence and accompanied by clearly identifiable failure cases. Our results show that selectively applied fusion provides dependable and interpretable extension to strong kernel-based methods, correcting their weaknesses precisely where the data support it.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models in financial services necessitates rigorous evaluation frameworks to assess their performance, efficiency, and practical applicability. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the GPT-OSS model family alongside contemporary LLMs across ten diverse financial NLP tasks. Through extensive experimentation on 120B and 20B parameter variants of GPT-OSS, we reveal a counterintuitive finding: the smaller GPT-OSS-20B model achieves comparable accuracy (65.1% vs 66.5%) while demonstrating superior computational efficiency with 198.4 Token Efficiency Score and 159.80 tokens per second processing speed [1]. Our evaluation encompasses sentiment analysis, question answering, and entity recognition tasks using real-world financial datasets including Financial PhraseBank, FiQA-SA, and FLARE FINERORD. We introduce novel efficiency metrics that capture the trade-off between model performance and resource utilization, providing critical insights for deployment decisions in production environments. The benchmark reveals that GPT-OSS models consistently outperform larger competitors including Qwen3-235B, challenging the prevailing assumption that model scale directly correlates with task performance [2]. Our findings demonstrate that architectural innovations and training strategies in GPT-OSS enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance with significantly reduced computational overhead, offering a pathway toward sustainable and cost-effective deployment of LLMs in financial applications.

Conclusion: Persistence能实现可靠的模型和超参数选择。

Abstract: Modern representation learning increasingly relies on unsupervised and self-supervised methods trained on large-scale unlabeled data. While these approaches achieve impressive generalization across tasks and domains, evaluating embedding quality without labels remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose Persistence, a topology-aware metric based on persistent homology that quantifies the geometric structure and topological richness of embedding spaces in a fully unsupervised manner. Unlike metrics that assume linear separability or rely on covariance structure, Persistence captures global and multi-scale organization. Empirical results across diverse domains show that Persistence consistently achieves top-tier correlations with downstream performance, outperforming existing unsupervised metrics and enabling reliable model and hyperparameter selection.

Motivation: 现有基于注意力或图的多变量时间序列预测方法存在强时间自依赖被干扰、软最大化忽略负相关、变量难感知时间位置等问题。

Result: 在12个来自不同应用领域的真实数据集上实验，SEED取得了最优性能。

Conclusion: SEED框架有效且具有通用性。

Abstract: Effective multivariate time series forecasting often benefits from accurately modeling complex inter-variable dependencies. However, existing attention- or graph-based methods face three key issues: (a) strong temporal self-dependencies are often disrupted by irrelevant variables; (b) softmax normalization ignores and reverses negative correlations; (c) variables struggle to perceive their temporal positions. To address these, we propose \textbf{SEED}, a Spectral Entropy-guided Evaluation framework for spatial-temporal Dependency modeling. SEED introduces a Dependency Evaluator, a key innovation that leverages spectral entropy to dynamically provide a preliminary evaluation of the spatial and temporal dependencies of each variable, enabling the model to adaptively balance Channel Independence (CI) and Channel Dependence (CD) strategies. To account for temporal regularities originating from the influence of other variables rather than intrinsic dynamics, we propose Spectral Entropy-based Fuser to further refine the evaluated dependency weights, effectively separating this part. Moreover, to preserve negative correlations, we introduce a Signed Graph Constructor that enables signed edge weights, overcoming the limitations of softmax. Finally, to help variables perceive their temporal positions and thereby construct more comprehensive spatial features, we introduce the Context Spatial Extractor, which leverages local contextual windows to extract spatial features. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate that SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generality.

Conclusion: 几何代数为手工物理和无结构深度网络提供了有效中间方案，能为多物体场景提供样本高效的动力学模型。

Abstract: Equivariance is a powerful prior for learning physical dynamics, yet exact group equivariance can degrade performance if the symmetries are broken. We propose object-centric world models built with geometric algebra neural networks, providing a soft geometric inductive bias. Our models are evaluated using simulated environments of 2d rigid body dynamics with static obstacles, where we train for next-step predictions autoregressively. For long-horizon rollouts we show that the soft inductive bias of our models results in better performance in terms of physical fidelity compared to non-equivariant baseline models. The approach complements recent soft-equivariance ideas and aligns with the view that simple, well-chosen priors can yield robust generalization. These results suggest that geometric algebra offers an effective middle ground between hand-crafted physics and unstructured deep nets, delivering sample-efficient dynamics models for multi-object scenes.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made significant progress in physics simulation, typically approximating dynamics with a monolithic end-to-end optimized neural network. Although these models offer an effective way to simulation, they may lose essential features compared to traditional numerical simulators, such as physical interpretability and reliability. Drawing inspiration from classical simulators that operate in a modular fashion, this paper presents Neural Modular Physics (NMP) for elastic simulation, which combines the approximation capacity of neural networks with the physical reliability of traditional simulators. Beyond the previous monolithic learning paradigm, NMP enables direct supervision of intermediate quantities and physical constraints by decomposing elastic dynamics into physically meaningful neural modules connected through intermediate physical quantities. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, our method transforms the numerical computation flow into a modular neural simulator, achieving improved physical consistency and generalizability. Experimentally, NMP demonstrates superior generalization to unseen initial conditions and resolutions, stable long-horizon simulation, better preservation of physical properties compared to other neural simulators, and greater feasibility in scenarios with unknown underlying dynamics than traditional simulators.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are widely used in tasks that require low latency and lightweight deployment, particularly classification. As interpretability and robustness gain increasing importance, explanation-guided learning has emerged as an effective framework by introducing attribution-based supervision during training; however, deriving general and reliable attribution priors remains a significant challenge. Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features. Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently enhances both interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) currently constitute the dominant paradigm for large language models (LLMs). Energy-based models (EBMs) represent another class of models, which have historically been less prevalent in LLM development, yet naturally characterize the optimal policy in post-training alignment. In this paper, we provide a unified view of these two model classes. Taking the chain rule of probability as a starting point, we establish an explicit bijection between ARMs and EBMs in function space, which we show to correspond to a special case of the soft Bellman equation in maximum entropy reinforcement learning. Building upon this bijection, we derive the equivalence between supervised learning of ARMs and EBMs. Furthermore, we analyze the distillation of EBMs into ARMs by providing theoretical error bounds. Our results provide insights into the ability of ARMs to plan ahead, despite being based on the next-token prediction paradigm.

Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is a promising technology to make medical data available for secondary use in a privacy-compliant manner. A popular method for creating realistic patient data is the rule-based Synthea data generator. Synthea generates data based on rules describing the lifetime of a synthetic patient. These rules typically express the probability of a condition occurring, such as a disease, depending on factors like age. Since they only contain statistical information, rules usually have no specific data protection requirements. However, creating meaningful rules can be a very complex process that requires expert knowledge and realistic sample data. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate an approach to automatically generate Synthea rules based on statistics from tabular data, which we extracted from cancer reports. As an example use case, we created a Synthea module for glioblastoma from a real-world dataset and used it to generate a synthetic dataset. Compared to the original dataset, the synthetic data reproduced known disease courses and mostly retained the statistical properties. Overall, synthetic patient data holds great potential for privacy-preserving research. The data can be used to formulate hypotheses and to develop prototypes, but medical interpretation should consider the specific limitations as with any currently available approach.

Abstract: At NeurIPS 2024, Kera et al. introduced the use of transformers for computing Groebner bases, a central object in computer algebra with numerous practical applications. In this paper, we improve this approach by applying Hierarchical Attention Transformers (HATs) to solve systems of multivariate polynomial equations via Groebner bases computation. The HAT architecture incorporates a tree-structured inductive bias that enables the modeling of hierarchical relationships present in the data and thus achieves significant computational savings compared to conventional flat attention models. We generalize to arbitrary depths and include a detailed computational cost analysis. Combined with curriculum learning, our method solves instances that are much larger than those in Kera et al.

Abstract: Urban wind flow modeling and simulation play an important role in air quality assessment and sustainable city planning. A key challenge for modeling and simulation is handling the complex geometries of the urban landscape. Low order models are limited in capturing the effects of geometry, while high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are prohibitively expensive, especially across multiple geometries or wind conditions. Here, we propose a generative diffusion framework for synthesizing steady-state urban wind fields over unstructured meshes that requires only geometry information. The framework combines a hierarchical graph neural network with score-based diffusion modeling to generate accurate and diverse velocity fields without requiring temporal rollouts or dense measurements. Trained across multiple mesh slices and wind angles, the model generalizes to unseen geometries, recovers key flow structures such as wakes and recirculation zones, and offers uncertainty-aware predictions. Ablation studies confirm robustness to mesh variation and performance under different inference regimes. This work develops is the first step towards foundation models for the built environment that can help urban planners rapidly evaluate design decisions under densification and climate uncertainty.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets without environment interaction, but existing Decision Transformer (DT) architectures struggle with long-horizon credit assignment and complex state-action dependencies. We introduce the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), a novel architecture incorporating quantum-inspired computational mechanisms to address these challenges. Our approach integrates two core components: Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations that capture non-local feature correlations, and Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation. Through comprehensive experiments on continuous control tasks, we demonstrate over 2,000\% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Critically, our ablation studies reveal strong synergistic effects between quantum-inspired components: neither alone achieves competitive performance, yet their combination produces dramatic improvements far exceeding individual contributions. This synergy demonstrates that effective quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. Our analysis identifies three key computational advantages: enhanced credit assignment through non-local correlations, implicit ensemble behavior via parallel processing, and adaptive resource allocation through learnable interference. These findings establish quantum-inspired design principles as a promising direction for advancing transformer architectures in sequential decision-making, with implications extending beyond reinforcement learning to neural architecture design more broadly.

Conclusion: 保形预测在医学领域使用时，其实用性受限于医学数据稀缺导致的校准集规模问题。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is transforming healthcare, but safe clinical decisions demand reliable uncertainty estimates that standard ML models fail to provide. Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular tool that allows users to turn heuristic uncertainty estimates into uncertainty estimates with statistical guarantees. CP works by converting predictions of a ML model, together with a calibration sample, into prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true label with any desired probability. An often cited advantage is that CP theory holds for calibration samples of arbitrary size, suggesting that uncertainty estimates with practically meaningful statistical guarantees can be achieved even if only small calibration sets are available. We question this promise by showing that, although the statistical guarantees hold for calibration sets of arbitrary size, the practical utility of these guarantees does highly depend on the size of the calibration set. This observation is relevant in medical domains because data is often scarce and obtaining large calibration sets is therefore infeasible. We corroborate our critique in an empirical demonstration on a medical image classification task.

Abstract: Refined trajectory inference of urban rail transit is of great significance to the operation organization. In this paper, we develop a fully data-driven approach to inferring individual travel trajectories in urban rail transit systems. It utilizes data from the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems to infer key trajectory elements, such as selected train, access/egress time, and transfer time. The approach includes establishing train alternative sets based on spatio-temporal constraints, data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, and trave l trajectory construction. To realize data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, a data-driven parameter estimation method based on KL divergence combined with EM algorithm (KLEM) was proposed. This method eliminates the reliance on external or survey data for parameter fitting, enhancing the robustness and applicability of the model. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of using synthetic data to validate the result, this paper employs real individual travel trajectory data for verification. The results show that the approach developed in this paper can achieve high-precision passenger trajectory inference, with an accuracy rate of over 90% in urban rail transit travel trajectory inference during peak hours.

Conclusion: 所提出的几何框架有效且在信息论上具有最优性，能在高风险领域防止幻觉承诺。

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for policy-constrained semantic interpretation that provably prevents hallucinated commitments in high-stakes domains. Semantic meaning is represented as direction on a unit sphere, evidence is modeled as sets of witness vectors, and admissible interpretations correspond to spherical convex regions. Policy constraints are introduced as explicit priors defined over the same manifold, separated from evidence geometry. Interpretation reduces to constrained optimization over admissible regions, with refusal emerging as a topologically necessary outcome under contradiction or policy exclusion. We connect this framework to information theory, Bayesian inference, and sheaf-theoretic semantics, proving that our complexity bounds are information-theoretically optimal. Empirical validation on large scale regulated financial data demonstrates zero hallucinated approvals across multiple policy regimes-the first such result at scale.

Abstract: Incidental findings in CT scans, though often benign, can have significant clinical implications and should be reported following established guidelines. Traditional manual inspection by radiologists is time-consuming and variable. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision-language models (VLMs) in a plan-and-execute agentic approach to improve the efficiency and precision of incidental findings detection, classification, and reporting for abdominal CT scans. Given medical guidelines for abdominal organs, the process of managing incidental findings is automated through a planner-executor framework. The planner, based on LLM, generates Python scripts using predefined base functions, while the executor runs these scripts to perform the necessary checks and detections, via VLMs, segmentation models, and image processing subroutines.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a CT abdominal benchmark for three organs, in a fully automatic end-to-end manner. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing pure VLM-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 日内个性化可对长视频服务产生有意义的影响，是实时架构的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Many recommender systems in long-form video streaming reply on batch-trained models and batch-updated features, where user features are updated daily and served statically throughout the day. While efficient, this approach fails to incorporate a user's most recent actions, often resulting in stale recommendations. In this work, we present a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for intra-day personalization that selectively injects recent watch history at inference time without requiring model retraining. Our approach selectively overrides stale user features at inference time using the recent watch history, allowing the system to adapt instantly to evolving preferences. By reducing the personalization feedback loop from daily to intra-day, we observed a statistically significant 0.47% increase in key user engagement metrics which ranked among the most substantial engagement gains observed in recent experimentation cycles. To our knowledge, this is the first published evidence that intra-day personalization can drive meaningful impact in long-form video streaming service, providing a compelling alternative to full real-time architectures where model retraining is required.

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: With the growing ease of academic publishing, the volume of research papers, especially in AI-related fields, has surged dramatically. This flood of publications makes it difficult for truly novel and impactful work to stand out, and manual novelty assessment is often unstable and time-consuming. Our project aims to develop a model that estimates and ranks the conceptual novelty of AI papers, enabling a data-driven and scalable assessment of research originality. Such a system can help researchers efficiently identify submissions that introduce genuinely innovative ideas rather than minor variants, and provide conference reviewers with a quantitative and consistent signal of novelty. Our approach evaluates novelty primarily through a paper's title, abstract, and semantic similarity to prior literature. Given the motivation of novelty estimation, we explore two task formulations with different modeling objectives, each offering a different perspective: (1) binary classification, which predicts the paper's absolute novelty from learned patterns of prior novel works, and (2) pairwise novelty comparison, which learns to distinguish papers by relative novelty over others. We fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and SciBERT on both tasks, benchmarking against GPT-5.1 to analyze how task formulation and modeling choices affect performance. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengxuYan/NoveltyRank.

Result: 预测层面的模型表现不能可靠转化为下游决策表现，不同决策任务中模型排名会变化。

Conclusion: 典型的预测评估不足以针对特定决策任务选择最优预测模型。

Abstract: Standard weather forecast evaluations focus on the forecaster's perspective and on a statistical assessment comparing forecasts and observations. In practice, however, forecasts are used to make decisions, so it seems natural to take the decision-maker's perspective and quantify the value of a forecast by its ability to improve decision-making. Decision calibration provides a novel framework for evaluating forecast performance at the decision level rather than the forecast level. We evaluate decision calibration to compare Machine Learning and classical numerical weather prediction models on various weather-dependent decision tasks. We find that model performance at the forecast level does not reliably translate to performance in downstream decision-making: some performance differences only become apparent at the decision level, and model rankings can change among different decision tasks. Our results confirm that typical forecast evaluations are insufficient for selecting the optimal forecast model for a specific decision task.

Method: 通过实验研究MCD捕捉真实不确定性的能力，并与高斯过程（GP）和贝叶斯神经网络（BNN）比较。

Result: MCD难以准确反映潜在的真实不确定性，尤其在外部和内部插值区域，不如贝叶斯模型。

Conclusion: 在实验中实现和评估的MCD在捕捉认知和偶然不确定性方面不如传统贝叶斯方法可靠。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is crucial for machine learning models, especially in safety-critical domains. While exact Bayesian inference offers a principled approach, it is often computationally infeasible for deep neural networks. Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) was proposed as an efficient approximation to Bayesian inference in deep learning by applying neuron dropout at inference time \citep{gal2016dropout}. Hence, the method generates multiple sub-models yielding a distribution of predictions to estimate uncertainty. We empirically investigate its ability to capture true uncertainty and compare to Gaussian Processes (GP) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN). We find that MCD struggles to accurately reflect the underlying true uncertainty, particularly failing to capture increased uncertainty in extrapolation and interpolation regions as observed in Bayesian models. The findings suggest that uncertainty estimates from MCD, as implemented and evaluated in these experiments, is not as reliable as those from traditional Bayesian approaches for capturing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

Result: DAL模型在三个任务上收敛更快，验证准确率与传统激活函数模型相当或更高。

Conclusion: 对FAN的理解从频谱解释转向训练动态分析，DAL是更高效的收敛加速器。

Abstract: Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) was recently proposed as a simple way to improve neural network performance by replacing part of ReLU activations with sine and cosine functions. Although several studies have reported small but consistent gains across tasks, the underlying mechanism behind these improvements has remained unclear. In this work, we show that only the sine activation contributes positively to performance, whereas the cosine activation tends to be detrimental. Our analysis reveals that the improvement is not a consequence of the sine function's periodic nature; instead, it stems from the function's local behavior near x = 0, where its non-zero derivative mitigates the vanishing-gradient problem. We further show that FAN primarily alleviates the dying-ReLU problem, in which a neuron consistently receives negative inputs, produces zero gradients, and stops learning. Although modern ReLU-like activations, such as Leaky ReLU, GELU, and Swish, reduce ReLU's zero-gradient region, they still contain input domains where gradients remain significantly diminished, contributing to slower optimization and hindering rapid convergence. FAN addresses this limitation by introducing a more stable gradient pathway. This analysis shifts the understanding of FAN's benefits from a spectral interpretation to a concrete analysis of training dynamics, leading to the development of the Dual-Activation Layer (DAL), a more efficient convergence accelerator. We evaluate DAL on three tasks: classification of noisy sinusoidal signals versus pure noise, MNIST digit classification, and ECG-based biometric recognition. In all cases, DAL models converge faster and achieve equal or higher validation accuracy compared to models with conventional activations.

Conclusion: ERBP将多种修复方法转化为单一量化设计规则，即监控和规划熵通量。

Abstract: Self-referential learning -- training a model on data it generated itself -- promises boundless scalability but chronically suffers from model collapse: language models degenerate into repetitive text, GANs drop modes, and reinforcement-learning policies over-exploit. Although practitioners employ ad~hoc fixes such as real-data mixing, entropy bonuses, knowledge distillation, or retrieval-augmented generation, a single principle that explains both the failure mode and the success of these fixes has remained elusive. We present Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-geometric framework that unifies these phenomena. We model the closed loop as a stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Without external coupling, finite-sample noise forces the system to project onto an ever-shrinking empirical support, causing exponential entropy decay and eventual collapse. Introducing an Entropy Reservoir -- a high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection -- injects a controllable entropy flux that provably stabilises the dynamics. Our theory yields (i) a necessary condition for collapse, (ii) a sufficient condition that guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor, and (iii) closed-form rates that depend only on sample size and the strong-convexity/Lipschitz constants of the Bregman generator. Experiments on large-language-model self-training, Soft Actor-Critic in reinforcement learning, and GAN optimisation validate our predictions and show that disparate stabilisation heuristics correspond to specific reservoir choices and coupling coefficients.

Conclusion: 验证预训练和微调架构间跨层线性编码存在，且基于数据的编码近似高效、可跨领域泛化。

Abstract: Results in interpretability suggest that large vision and language models learn implicit linear encodings when models are biased by in-context prompting. However, the existence of similar linear representations in more general adaptation regimes has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we develop the concept of a task matrix, a linear transformation from a base to finetuned embedding state. We demonstrate that for vision and text models and ten different datasets, a base model augmented with a task matrix achieves results surpassing linear probes, sometimes approaching finetuned levels. Our results validate the existence of cross-layer linear encodings between pretrained and finetuned architectures. Moreover, we show that a data-based approximation for such encodings is both efficient and generalizable to multiple domains. We make our implementation publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习有优势，为解决在线线性回归问题，需新模型应对数据漂移等场景。

Result: OLR - WA性能与批量回归相当，优于其他在线模型，收敛快，能处理时间和基于置信度的场景。

Conclusion: OLR - WA通用性和实用性强，是在线线性回归任务的有价值解决方案。

Abstract: Online learning updates models incrementally with new data, avoiding large storage requirements and costly model recalculations. In this paper, we introduce "OLR-WA; OnLine Regression with Weighted Average", a novel and versatile multivariate online linear regression model. We also investigate scenarios involving drift, where the underlying patterns in the data evolve over time, conduct convergence analysis, and compare our approach with existing online regression models. The results of OLR-WA demonstrate its ability to achieve performance comparable to the batch regression, while also showcasing comparable or superior performance when compared with other state-of-the-art online models, thus establishing its effectiveness. Moreover, OLR-WA exhibits exceptional performance in terms of rapid convergence, surpassing other online models with consistently achieving high r2 values as a performance measure from the first iteration to the last iteration, even when initialized with minimal amount of data points, as little as 1% to 10% of the total data points. In addition to its ability to handle time-based (temporal drift) scenarios, remarkably, OLR-WA stands out as the only model capable of effectively managing confidence-based challenging scenarios. It achieves this by adopting a conservative approach in its updates, giving priority to older data points with higher confidence levels. In summary, OLR-WA's performance further solidifies its versatility and utility across different contexts, making it a valuable solution for online linear regression tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 多轮LM代理的模仿学习存在协变量偏移问题，影响微调效果。

Method: 提出新颖数据生成方法，引入部分在线策略下的专家纠正（OECs），在软件工程任务中对比OEC数据与其他方法，并采用拒绝采样结合监督微调技术训练模型。

Result: 在7b和32b设置下，OEC轨迹分别比传统模仿学习有14%和13%的相对提升。

Conclusion: 有效进行多轮LM代理训练需结合专家演示和在线策略数据。

Abstract: A popular paradigm for training LM agents relies on imitation learning, fine-tuning on expert trajectories. However, we show that the off-policy nature of imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from the fundamental limitation known as covariate shift: as the student policy's behavior diverges from the expert's, it encounters states not present in the training data, reducing the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified. Our results demonstrate the need for combining expert demonstrations with on-policy data for effective multi-turn LM agent training.

Result: 在多种图上ATLAS达到与基线方法相当的准确性，在异质图和同质图上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 多分辨率社区特征可系统调节同质性和异质性环境下的性能，为可解释图学习提供原则性路径。

Abstract: We present ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs), a novel graph learning algorithm that addresses two important challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.

The proposed method is validated through simulations, showing significant gains over commonly used methods.

Motivation: 现有基准多关注有已知最优解的任务，需要一个针对最优解未知但解质量可客观评估问题的基准。

Method: 由专家设计和审核，构建包含算法问题和研究问题的156个开放式问题集，为每个问题提供专家参考解和自动评估器。

Result: 前沿推理模型在算法和研究赛道上远落后于人类专家，增加推理预算不能缩小差距，模型常过度优化生成可行代码而非发现高质量算法和系统设计。

Conclusion: FrontierCS结合开放式设计、可衡量进展和专家策划，是计算机科学难度前沿的基准。

Abstract: We introduce FrontierCS, a benchmark of 156 open-ended problems across diverse areas of computer science, designed and reviewed by experts, including CS PhDs and top-tier competitive programming participants and problem setters. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on tasks with known optimal solutions, FrontierCS targets problems where the optimal solution is unknown, but the quality of a solution can be objectively evaluated. Models solve these tasks by implementing executable programs rather than outputting a direct answer. FrontierCS includes algorithmic problems, which are often NP-hard variants of competitive programming problems with objective partial scoring, and research problems with the same property. For each problem we provide an expert reference solution and an automatic evaluator. Combining open-ended design, measurable progress, and expert curation, FrontierCS provides a benchmark at the frontier of computer-science difficulty. Empirically, we find that frontier reasoning models still lag far behind human experts on both the algorithmic and research tracks, that increasing reasoning budgets alone does not close this gap, and that models often over-optimize for generating merely workable code instead of discovering high-quality algorithms and system designs.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决扩散模型生成满足约束条件样本的问题，在约束误指定时也有较好表现。

Abstract: Diffusion models struggle to produce samples that respect constraints, a common requirement in scientific applications. Recent approaches have introduced regularization terms in the loss or guidance methods during sampling to enforce such constraints, but they bias the generative model away from the true data distribution. This is a problem, especially when the constraint is misspecified, a common issue when formulating constraints on scientific data. In this paper, instead of changing the loss or the sampling loop, we integrate a guidance-inspired adjustment into the denoiser itself, giving it a soft inductive bias towards constraint-compliant samples. We show that these softly constrained denoisers exploit constraint knowledge to improve compliance over standard denoisers, and maintain enough flexibility to deviate from it when there is misspecification with observed data.

Conclusion: 通过数值实验验证了方法在高维问题中的有效性。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning for controlled diffusion processes with unbounded continuous state spaces, bounded continuous actions, and polynomially growing rewards: settings that arise naturally in finance, economics, and operations research. To overcome the challenges of continuous and high-dimensional domains, we introduce a model-based algorithm that adaptively partitions the joint state-action space. The algorithm maintains estimators of drift, volatility, and rewards within each partition, refining the discretization whenever estimation bias exceeds statistical confidence. This adaptive scheme balances exploration and approximation, enabling efficient learning in unbounded domains. Our analysis establishes regret bounds that depend on the problem horizon, state dimension, reward growth order, and a newly defined notion of zooming dimension tailored to unbounded diffusion processes. The bounds recover existing results for bounded settings as a special case, while extending theoretical guarantees to a broader class of diffusion-type problems. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments, including applications to high-dimensional problems such as multi-asset mean-variance portfolio selection.

Conclusion: DreamPRM-Code在编码领域的测试时缩放应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have become essential for improving Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling, yet their effectiveness in coding remains limited due to the lack of meaningful step decompositions in code and the noise of Monte-Carlo-generated partial labels. We propose DreamPRM-Code, a coding-focused PRM that treats functions as reasoning steps using a Chain-of-Function prompting strategy to induce modular code generation, enabling PRM training and application analogous to mathematical reasoning tasks. To address label noise, DreamPRM-Code introduces a meta-learning-based correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution unit-test labels and performs bi-level optimization to refine intermediate labels. Applying on test-time scaling, DreamPRM-Code achieved state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench with 80.9 pass@1 rate, surpassing OpenAI o4-mini.

Motivation: 现有分析价格演变的工具（如技术指标、预测模型等）存在无法解答重要问题、缺乏透明度和可审计性等不足，需要新方法。

Conclusion: SPA不是预测系统，其价值在于为历史价格结构提供透明、可复现的视角，可补充分析师工作流程等。

Abstract: Understanding how prices evolve over time often requires peeling back the layers of market noise to identify clear, structural behavior. Many of the tools commonly used for this purpose technical indicators, chart heuristics, or even sophisticated predictive models leave important questions unanswered. Technical indicators depend on platform-specific rules, and predictive systems typically offer little in terms of explanation. In settings that demand transparency or auditability, this poses a significant challenge. We introduce the Stock Pattern Assistant (SPA), a deterministic framework designed to extract monotonic price runs, attach relevant public events through a symmetric correlation window, and generate explanations that are factual, historical, and guardrailed. SPA relies only on daily OHLCV data and a normalized event stream, making the pipeline straight-forward to audit and easy to reproduce. To illustrate SPA's behavior in practice, we evaluate it across four equities-AAPL, NVDA, SCHW, and PGR-chosen to span a range of volatility regimes and sector characteristics. Although the evaluation period is modest, the results demonstrate how SPA consistently produces stable structural decompositions and contextual narratives. Ablation experiments further show how deterministic segmentation, event alignment, and constrained explanation each contribute to interpretability. SPA is not a forecasting system, nor is it intended to produce trading signals. Its value lies in offering a transparent, reproducible view of historical price structure that can complement analyst workflows, risk reviews, and broader explainable-AI pipelines.

Result: 增加认知多样性能缓解崩溃，但存在最优水平，模型太少或太多都会导致性能不佳。

Conclusion: 在AI单一文化背景下，需监测AI系统多样性，制定政策鼓励更多特定领域和社区的模型。

Abstract: The growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) raises concerns of knowledge collapse, i.e., a reduction to the most dominant and central set of ideas. Prior work has demonstrated single-model collapse, defined as performance decay in an AI model trained on its own output. Inspired by ecology, we ask whether AI ecosystem diversity, that is, diversity among models, can mitigate such a collapse. We build on the single-model approach but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. To study the effect of diversity on model performance, we segment the training data across language models and evaluate the resulting ecosystems over ten, self-training iterations. We find that increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but, interestingly, only up to an optimal level. Our results suggest that an ecosystem containing only a few diverse models fails to express the rich mixture of the full, true distribution, resulting in rapid performance decay. Yet distributing the data across too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity on the true distribution, leading to poor performance already in the first iteration step. In the context of AI monoculture, our results suggest the need to monitor diversity across AI systems and to develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models.

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite的20多个挑战性任务上，算法性能与当前最先进的无模型和基于模型的基线相当或更优。

Conclusion: 谱表示视角能有效解决强化学习在大状态和动作空间应用中的困难。

Abstract: In real-world applications with large state and action spaces, reinforcement learning (RL) typically employs function approximations to represent core components like the policies, value functions, and dynamics models. Although powerful approximations such as neural networks offer great expressiveness, they often present theoretical ambiguities, suffer from optimization instability and exploration difficulty, and incur substantial computational costs in practice. In this paper, we introduce the perspective of spectral representations as a solution to address these difficulties in RL. Stemming from the spectral decomposition of the transition operator, this framework yields an effective abstraction of the system dynamics for subsequent policy optimization while also providing a clear theoretical characterization. We reveal how to construct spectral representations for transition operators that possess latent variable structures or energy-based structures, which implies different learning methods to extract spectral representations from data. Notably, each of these learning methods realizes an effective RL algorithm under this framework. We also provably extend this spectral view to partially observable MDPs. Finally, we validate these algorithms on over 20 challenging tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, where they achieve performances comparable or superior to current state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines.

Result: 在频率选择性电磁场数据集上实验，EMFusion结合工作时间上下文信息在多项指标上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: EMFusion能有效进行电磁场水平预测，提供明确的不确定性量化，利于可靠决策。

Abstract: The rapid growth in wireless infrastructure has increased the need to accurately estimate and forecast electromagnetic field (EMF) levels to ensure ongoing compliance, assess potential health impacts, and support efficient network planning. While existing studies rely on univariate forecasting of wideband aggregate EMF data, frequency-selective multivariate forecasting is needed to capture the inter-operator and inter-frequency variations essential for proactive network planning. To this end, this paper introduces EMFusion, a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework that integrates diverse contextual factors (e.g., time of day, season, and holidays) while providing explicit uncertainty estimates. The proposed architecture features a residual U-Net backbone enhanced by a cross-attention mechanism that dynamically integrates external conditions to guide the generation process. Furthermore, EMFusion integrates an imputation-based sampling strategy that treats forecasting as a structural inpainting task, ensuring temporal coherence even with irregular measurements. Unlike standard point forecasters, EMFusion generates calibrated probabilistic prediction intervals directly from the learned conditional distribution, providing explicit uncertainty quantification essential for trustworthy decision-making. Numerical experiments conducted on frequency-selective EMF datasets demonstrate that EMFusion with the contextual information of working hours outperforms the baseline models with or without conditions. The EMFusion outperforms the best baseline by 23.85% in continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), 13.93% in normalized root mean square error, and reduces prediction CRPS error by 22.47%.

Motivation: 当前检索增强生成（RAG）系统的幻觉检测方法存在局限性，其基本限制未被严格表征，需要新的检测方法。

Method: 应用共形预测进行幻觉检测，使用约600个示例的校准集，对比基于嵌入的方法和GPT - 4作为裁判的检测效果。

Result: 在合成幻觉（Natural Questions）上实现94%覆盖率和0%误报率；基于嵌入的方法在三个真实幻觉基准测试中误报率高，GPT - 4在相同数据上误报率为7%。

Conclusion: 存在“语义错觉”现象，基于嵌入的检测不足以用于生产RAG部署。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain susceptible to hallucinations despite grounding in retrieved evidence. Current detection methods rely on semantic similarity and natural language inference (NLI), but their fundamental limitations have not been rigorously characterized. We apply conformal prediction to hallucination detection, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees that enable precise quantification of detection capabilities. Using calibration sets of approximately 600 examples, we achieve 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions). However, on three real hallucination benchmarks spanning multiple LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Llama-2, Mistral), embedding-based methods - including state-of-the-art OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoder models - exhibit unacceptable false positive rates: 100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, and 50% on WikiBio. Crucially, GPT-4 as an LLM judge achieves only 7% FPR (95% CI: [3.4%, 13.7%]) on the same data, proving the task is solvable through reasoning. We term this the "semantic illusion": semantically plausible hallucinations preserve similarity to source documents while introducing factual errors invisible to embeddings. This limitation persists across embedding architectures, LLM generators, and task types, suggesting embedding-based detection is insufficient for production RAG deployment.

Conclusion: FEAML实现了一种高效、可解释且自我改进的特征工程范式。

Abstract: Existing feature engineering methods based on large language models (LLMs) have not yet been applied to multi-label learning tasks. They lack the ability to model complex label dependencies and are not specifically adapted to the characteristics of multi-label tasks. To address the above issues, we propose Feature Engineering Automation for Multi-Label Learning (FEAML), an automated feature engineering method for multi-label classification which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs. By utilizing metadata and label co-occurrence matrices, LLMs are guided to understand the relationships between data features and task objectives, based on which high-quality features are generated. The newly generated features are evaluated in terms of model accuracy to assess their effectiveness, while Pearson correlation coefficients are used to detect redundancy. FEAML further incorporates the evaluation results as feedback to drive LLMs to continuously optimize code generation in subsequent iterations. By integrating LLMs with a feedback mechanism, FEAML realizes an efficient, interpretable and self-improving feature engineering paradigm. Empirical results on various multi-label datasets demonstrate that our FEAML outperforms other feature engineering methods.

Abstract: Operator learning has become a powerful tool for accelerating the solution of parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling rapid prediction of full spatiotemporal fields for new initial conditions or forcing functions. Existing architectures such as DeepONet and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) show strong empirical performance but often require large training datasets, lack explicit physical structure, and may suffer from instability in their trunk-network features, where mode imbalance or collapse can hinder accurate operator approximation. Motivated by the stability and locality of classical partition-of-unity (PoU) methods, we investigate PoU-based regularization techniques for operator learning and develop a revised formulation of the existing POU--PI--DeepONet framework. The resulting \emph{P}hysics-\emph{i}nformed \emph{P}artition \emph{P}enalty Deep Operator Network (PIP$^{2}$ Net) introduces a simplified and more principled partition penalty that improved the coordinated trunk outputs that leads to more expressiveness without sacrificing the flexibility of DeepONet. We evaluate PIP$^{2}$ Net on three nonlinear PDEs: the viscous Burgers equation, the Allen--Cahn equation, and a diffusion--reaction system. The results show that it consistently outperforms DeepONet, PI-DeepONet, and POU-DeepONet in prediction accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by fractional Brownian motion (fBm) are increasingly used to model systems with rough dynamics and long-range dependence, such as those arising in quantitative finance and reliability engineering. However, these processes are non-Markovian and lack a semimartingale structure, rendering many classical parameter estimation techniques inapplicable or computationally intractable beyond very specific cases. This work investigates two central questions: (i) whether integrating path signatures into deep learning architectures can improve the trade-off between estimation accuracy and model complexity, and (ii) what constitutes an effective architecture for leveraging signatures as feature maps. We introduce SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), a neural architecture that integrates path signatures with multi-head self-attention, supported by a convolutional preprocessing layer and a multilayer perceptron for effective feature encoding. SigMA learns model parameters from synthetically generated paths of fBm-driven SDEs, including fractional Brownian motion, fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and rough Heston models, with a particular focus on estimating the Hurst parameter and on joint multi-parameter inference, and it generalizes robustly to unseen trajectories. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and two real-world datasets (i.e., equity-index realized volatility and Li-ion battery degradation) show that SigMA consistently outperforms CNN, LSTM, vanilla Transformer, and Deep Signature baselines in accuracy, robustness, and model compactness. These results demonstrate that combining signature transforms with attention-based architectures provides an effective and scalable framework for parameter inference in stochastic systems with rough or persistent temporal structure.

Result: 在15种基线方法和14个基准数据集的实验中，FUEL在下游任务中表现有效。

Conclusion: FUEL在具有不同同质性水平的图上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised node representation learning aims to obtain meaningful node embeddings without relying on node labels. To achieve this, graph convolution, which aggregates information from neighboring nodes, is commonly employed to encode node features and graph topology. However, excessive reliance on graph convolution can be suboptimal-especially in non-homophilic graphs-since it may yield unduly similar embeddings for nodes that differ in their features or topological properties. As a result, adjusting the degree of graph convolution usage has been actively explored in supervised learning settings, whereas such approaches remain underexplored in unsupervised scenarios. To tackle this, we propose FUEL, which adaptively learns the adequate degree of graph convolution usage by aiming to enhance intra-class similarity and inter-class separability in the embedding space. Since classes are unknown, FUEL leverages node features to identify node clusters and treats these clusters as proxies for classes. Through extensive experiments using 15 baseline methods and 14 benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FUEL in downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across graphs with diverse levels of homophily.

Result: 得出交互秩差距、等价（头数）定理和梯度高速公路结果。

Conclusion: 结果为现代序列架构设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Sequence modeling has produced diverse architectures -- from classical recurrent neural networks to modern Transformers and state space models (SSMs) -- yet a unified theoretical understanding of expressivity and trainability trade-offs remains limited. We introduce a unified framework that represents a broad class of sequence maps via an input-dependent effective interaction operator $W_{ij}(X)$, making explicit two recurring construction patterns: (i) the Unified Factorized Framework (Explicit) (attention-style mixing), in which $W_{ij}(X)$ varies through scalar coefficients applied to shared value maps, and (ii) Structured Dynamics (Implicit) (state-space recurrences), in which $W_{ij}$ is induced by a latent dynamical system. Using this framework, we derive three theoretical results. First, we establish the Interaction Rank Gap: models in the Unified Factorized Framework, such as single-head attention, are constrained to a low-dimensional operator span and cannot represent certain structured dynamical maps. Second, we prove an Equivalence (Head-Count) Theorem showing that, within our multi-head factorized class, representing a linear SSM whose lag operators span a $k$-dimensional subspace on length-$n$ sequences requires and is achievable with $H=k$ heads. Third, we prove a Gradient Highway Result, showing that attention layers admit inputs with distance-independent gradient paths, whereas stable linear dynamics exhibit distance-dependent gradient attenuation. Together, these results formalize a fundamental trade-off between algebraic expressivity (interaction/operator span) and long-range gradient propagation, providing theoretical grounding for modern sequence architecture design.

Conclusion: FADTI框架有效，其频率域归纳偏置设计有助于多变量时间序列插补。

Abstract: Multivariate time series imputation is fundamental in applications such as healthcare, traffic forecasting, and biological modeling, where sensor failures and irregular sampling lead to pervasive missing values. However, existing Transformer- and diffusion-based models lack explicit inductive biases and frequency awareness, limiting their generalization under structured missing patterns and distribution shifts. We propose FADTI, a diffusion-based framework that injects frequency-informed feature modulation via a learnable Fourier Bias Projection (FBP) module and combines it with temporal modeling through self-attention and gated convolution. FBP supports multiple spectral bases, enabling adaptive encoding of both stationary and non-stationary patterns. This design injects frequency-domain inductive bias into the generative imputation process. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including a newly introduced biological time series dataset, show that FADTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under high missing rates.

Conclusion: MORSE框架能自动组合多启发式奖励，有效应对多目标环境中奖励函数设计难题。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning, especially in multi-objective environments. In this work, we propose Multi-Objective Reward Shaping with Exploration (MORSE), a general framework that automatically combines multiple human-designed heuristic rewards into a unified reward function. MORSE formulates the shaping process as a bi-level optimization problem: the inner loop trains a policy to maximize the current shaped reward, while the outer loop updates the reward function to optimize task performance. To encourage exploration in the reward space and avoid suboptimal local minima, MORSE introduces stochasticity into the shaping process, injecting noise guided by task performance and the prediction error of a fixed, randomly initialized neural network. Experimental results in MuJoCo and Isaac Sim environments show that MORSE effectively balances multiple objectives across various robotic tasks, achieving task performance comparable to those obtained with manually tuned reward functions.

Conclusion: TrajSyn是一种有效的隐私保护框架，可在联邦学习中进行服务器端对抗训练。

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed on edge devices are increasingly used in safety-critical applications. However, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses significant risks, especially in Federated Learning (FL) settings where identical models are distributed across thousands of clients. While adversarial training is a strong defense, it is difficult to apply in FL due to strict client-data privacy constraints and the limited compute available on edge devices. In this work, we introduce TrajSyn, a privacy-preserving framework that enables effective server-side adversarial training by synthesizing a proxy dataset from the trajectories of client model updates, without accessing raw client data. We show that TrajSyn consistently improves adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks with no extra compute burden on the client device.

Conclusion: 测量解纠缠的相关指标在操纵时不足以确立独立性，影响不相交子空间不足以实现概念选择性，强调组合评估的重要性。

Abstract: A central goal of interpretability is to recover representations of causally relevant concepts from the activations of neural networks. The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research.

Conclusion: 强调在农业和环境系统中对机器学习预测进行验证感知解释的必要性，提倡领域感知验证、混合建模策略和更严格审查可解释性方法。

Abstract: This study examines the generalization performance and interpretability of machine learning (ML) models used for predicting crop yield and yield anomalies in Germany's NUTS-3 regions. Using a high-quality, long-term dataset, the study systematically compares the evaluation and temporal validation behavior of ensemble tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN).
  While all models perform well on spatially split, conventional test sets, their performance degrades substantially on temporally independent validation years, revealing persistent limitations in generalization. Notably, models with strong test-set accuracy, but weak temporal validation performance can still produce seemingly credible SHAP feature importance values. This exposes a critical vulnerability in post hoc explainability methods: interpretability may appear reliable even when the underlying model fails to generalize.
  These findings underscore the need for validation-aware interpretation of ML predictions in agricultural and environmental systems. Feature importance should not be accepted at face value unless models are explicitly shown to generalize to unseen temporal and spatial conditions. The study advocates for domain-aware validation, hybrid modeling strategies, and more rigorous scrutiny of explainability methods in data-driven agriculture. Ultimately, this work addresses a growing challenge in environmental data science: how can we evaluate generalization robustly enough to trust model explanations?

Conclusion: 多轮联邦学习易受推理攻击，聚合器威胁更大，数据集性质影响攻击性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a machine learning setting that reduces direct data exposure, improving the privacy guarantees of machine learning models. Yet, the exchange of model updates between the participants and the aggregator can still leak sensitive information. In this work, we present a new gradient-based membership inference attack for federated learning scenarios that exploits the temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple federated rounds. Our method uses the shadow technique to learn round-wise gradient patterns of the training records, requiring no access to the private dataset, and is designed to consider both semi-honest and malicious adversaries (aggregators or data owners). Beyond membership inference, we also provide a natural extension of the proposed attack to discrete attribute inference by contrasting gradient responses under alternative attribute hypotheses. The proposed attacks are model-agnostic, and therefore applicable to any gradient-based model and can be applied to both classification and regression settings. We evaluate the attack on CIFAR-100 and Purchase100 datasets for membership inference and on Breast Cancer Wisconsin for attribute inference. Our findings reveal strong attack performance and comparable computational and memory overhead in membership inference when compared to another attack from the literature. The obtained results emphasize that multi-round federated learning can increase the vulnerability to inference attacks, that aggregators pose a more substantial threat than data owners, and that attack performance is strongly influenced by the nature of the training dataset, with richer, high-dimensional data leading to stronger leakage than simpler tabular data.

Result: 实验验证了预测的方差减少，实现更快、更稳定收敛和更好的重建质量。

Conclusion: 从统一视角解释了不同INR架构如何通过改善NTK条件来缓解频谱偏差。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) often converge slowly and struggle to recover high-frequency details due to spectral bias. While prior work links this behavior to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), how specific architectural choices affect NTK conditioning remains unclear. We show that many INR mechanisms can be understood through their impact on a small set of pairwise similarity factors and scaling terms that jointly determine NTK eigenvalue variance. For standard coordinate MLPs, limited input-feature interactions induce large eigenvalue dispersion and poor conditioning. We derive closed-form variance decompositions for common INR components and show that positional encoding reshapes input similarity, spherical normalization reduces variance via layerwise scaling, and Hadamard modulation introduces additional similarity factors strictly below one, yielding multiplicative variance reduction. This unified view explains how diverse INR architectures mitigate spectral bias by improving NTK conditioning. Experiments across multiple tasks confirm the predicted variance reductions and demonstrate faster, more stable convergence with improved reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: 扩散大语言模型作为草稿生成器能有效解决自回归解码的效率问题，DEER框架具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Efficiency, as a critical practical challenge for LLM-driven agentic and reasoning systems, is increasingly constrained by the inherent latency of autoregressive (AR) decoding. Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x. Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at https://czc726.github.io/DEER/

Conclusion: Chorus能有效适应未见部署条件，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: In real-world IoT applications, sensor data is usually collected under diverse and dynamic contextual conditions where factors such as sensor placements or ambient environments can significantly affect data patterns and downstream performance. Traditional domain adaptation or generalization methods often ignore such context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective in handling unseen context shifts after deployment. In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts. Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show that Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices.

Conclusion: DBCata性能出色，可加速高效合金催化剂高通量计算筛选，是催化剂设计和优化的有力工具。

Abstract: The adsorption energy serves as a crucial descriptor for the large-scale screening of catalysts. Nevertheless, the limited distribution of training data for the extensively utilised machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), predominantly sourced from near-equilibrium structures, results in unreliable adsorption structures and consequent adsorption energy predictions. In this context, we present DBCata, a deep generative model that integrates a periodic Brownian-bridge framework with an equivariant graph neural network to establish a low-dimensional transition manifold between unrelaxed and DFT-relaxed structures, without requiring explicit energy or force information. Upon training, DBCata effectively generates high-fidelity adsorption geometries, achieving an interatomic distance mean absolute error (DMAE) of 0.035 \textÅ on the Catalysis-Hub dataset, which is nearly three times superior to that of the current state-of-the-art machine learning potential models. Moreover, the corresponding DFT accuracy can be improved within 0.1 eV in 94\% of instances by identifying and refining anomalous predictions through a hybrid chemical-heuristic and self-supervised outlier detection approach. We demonstrate that the remarkable performance of DBCata facilitates accelerated high-throughput computational screening for efficient alloy catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction, highlighting the potential of DBCata as a powerful tool for catalyst design and optimisation.

Abstract: Physiological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) provide complementary insights into human health and cognition, yet multi-modal integration is challenging due to limited multi-modal labeled data, and modality-specific differences . In this work, we adapt the CBraMod encoder for large-scale self-supervised ECG pretraining, introducing a dual-masking strategy to capture intra- and inter-lead dependencies. To overcome the above challenges, we utilize a pre-trained CBraMod encoder for EEG and pre-train a symmetric ECG encoder, equipping each modality with a rich foundational representation. These representations are then fused via simple embedding concatenation, allowing the classification head to learn cross-modal interactions, together enabling effective downstream learning despite limited multi-modal supervision. Evaluated on emotion recognition, our approach achieves near state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that carefully designed physiological encoders, even with straightforward fusion, substantially improve downstream performance. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model approaches to harness the holistic nature of physiological signals, enabling scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable solutions for healthcare and affective computing.

Result: 在Split CIFAR - 10、CIFAR - 100和MNIST上的实验表明，SSD提高了准确性、保留率和表示覆盖率。

Conclusion: SSD为稀疏持续学习提供了基于结构的解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse neural systems are gaining traction for efficient continual learning due to their modularity and low interference. Architectures such as Sparse Distributed Memory Multi-Layer Perceptrons (SDMLP) construct task-specific subnetworks via Top-K activation and have shown resilience against catastrophic forgetting. However, their rigid modularity limits cross-task knowledge reuse and leads to performance degradation under high sparsity. We propose Selective Subnetwork Distillation (SSD), a structurally guided continual learning framework that treats distillation not as a regularizer but as a topology-aligned information conduit. SSD identifies neurons with high activation frequency and selectively distills knowledge within previous Top-K subnetworks and output logits, without requiring replay or task labels. This enables structural realignment while preserving sparse modularity. Experiments on Split CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST demonstrate that SSD improves accuracy, retention, and representation coverage, offering a structurally grounded solution for sparse continual learning.

Abstract: The increasing number of cyber threats and rapidly evolving tactics, as well as the high volume of data in recent years, have caused classical machine learning, rules, and signature-based defence strategies to fail, rendering them unable to keep up. An alternative, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), has recently emerged, making use of computations based on quantum mechanics. It offers better encoding and processing of high-dimensional structures for certain problems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of QML techniques relevant to the domain of security, such as Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs), Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs), and Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs), and discusses the contributions of this paper in relation to existing research in the field and how it improves over them. It also maps these methods across supervised, unsupervised, and generative learning paradigms, and to core cybersecurity tasks, including intrusion and anomaly detection, malware and botnet classification, and encrypted-traffic analytics. It also discusses their application in the domain of cloud computing security, where QML can enhance secure and scalable operations. Many limitations of QML in the domain of cybersecurity have also been discussed, along with the directions for addressing them.

Conclusion: 研究结果为实际部署中平衡效率、效用和隐私保护提供了可行建议。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely deployed with quantization techniques to reduce memory and computational costs by lowering the numerical precision of their parameters. While quantization alters model parameters and their outputs, existing privacy analyses primarily focus on full-precision models, leaving a gap in understanding how bit-width reduction can affect privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of the privacy-utility relationship in post-training quantization (PTQ), a versatile family of methods that can be applied to pretrained models without further training. Using membership inference attacks as our evaluation framework, we analyze three popular PTQ algorithms-AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC-across multiple precision levels (4-bit, 2-bit, and 1.58-bit) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Our findings consistently show that low-precision PTQs can reduce privacy leakage. In particular, lower-precision models demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability compared to their full-precision counterparts, albeit at the cost of decreased utility. Additional ablation studies on the 1.58-bit quantization level show that quantizing only the last layer at higher precision enables fine-grained control over the privacy-utility trade-off. These results offer actionable insights for practitioners to balance efficiency, utility, and privacy protection in real-world deployments.

Result: 三种轴独立方法有持续增益（Transformer 提高 2.7%），单轴参考方法表现更优，准确率达 96.2%（提高 5.4%）。

Conclusion: 两种相位对齐策略是预测性维护系统切实可行且可扩展的增强方法。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance of rotating machinery increasingly relies on vibration signals, yet most learning-based approaches either discard phase during spectral feature extraction or use raw time-waveforms without explicitly leveraging phase information. This paper introduces two phase-aware preprocessing strategies to address random phase variations in multi-axis vibration data: (1) three-axis independent phase adjustment that aligns each axis individually to zero phase (2) single-axis reference phase adjustment that preserves inter-axis relationships by applying uniform time shifts. Using a newly constructed rotor dataset acquired with a synchronized three-axis sensor, we evaluate six deep learning architectures under a two-stage learning framework. Results demonstrate architecture-independent improvements: the three-axis independent method achieves consistent gains (+2.7\% for Transformer), while the single-axis reference approach delivers superior performance with up to 96.2\% accuracy (+5.4\%) by preserving spatial phase relationships. These findings establish both phase alignment strategies as practical and scalable enhancements for predictive maintenance systems.

Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable and distributed generation is transforming power systems and challenging conventional protection schemes that rely on fixed settings and local measurements. Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for centralized fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL), enabling faster and more adaptive decision-making. However, practical deployment critically depends on robustness. Protection algorithms must remain reliable even when confronted with missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data. This work introduces a unified framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of ML models in power system protection.
  High-fidelity EMT simulations are used to model realistic degradation scenarios, including sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and transient communication losses. The framework provides a consistent methodology for benchmarking models, quantifying the impact of limited observability, and identifying critical measurement channels required for resilient operation. Results show that FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%. These findings offer actionable guidance for robustness-aware design of future ML-assisted protection systems.

Conclusion: EUBRL算法是有效的，能更好地处理探索与利用困境。

Abstract: At the boundary between the known and the unknown, an agent inevitably confronts the dilemma of whether to explore or to exploit. Epistemic uncertainty reflects such boundaries, representing systematic uncertainty due to limited knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, $\texttt{EUBRL}$, which leverages epistemic guidance to achieve principled exploration. This guidance adaptively reduces per-step regret arising from estimation errors. We establish nearly minimax-optimal regret and sample complexity guarantees for a class of sufficiently expressive priors in infinite-horizon discounted MDPs. Empirically, we evaluate $\texttt{EUBRL}$ on tasks characterized by sparse rewards, long horizons, and stochasticity. Results demonstrate that $\texttt{EUBRL}$ achieves superior sample efficiency, scalability, and consistency.

Result: FlowBind在文本、图像和音频实验中达到可比质量，参数最多减少6倍，训练速度提高10倍。

Conclusion: FlowBind是一种高效的任意到任意生成框架，可减少数据需求和计算成本。

Abstract: Any-to-any generation seeks to translate between arbitrary subsets of modalities, enabling flexible cross-modal synthesis. Despite recent success, existing flow-based approaches are challenged by their inefficiency, as they require large-scale datasets often with restrictive pairing constraints, incur high computational cost from modeling joint distribution, and rely on complex multi-stage training. We propose FlowBind, an efficient framework for any-to-any generation. Our approach is distinguished by its simplicity: it learns a shared latent space capturing cross-modal information, with modality-specific invertible flows bridging this latent to each modality. Both components are optimized jointly under a single flow-matching objective, and at inference the invertible flows act as encoders and decoders for direct translation across modalities. By factorizing interactions through the shared latent, FlowBind naturally leverages arbitrary subsets of modalities for training, and achieves competitive generation quality while substantially reducing data requirements and computational cost. Experiments on text, image, and audio demonstrate that FlowBind attains comparable quality while requiring up to 6x fewer parameters and training 10x faster than prior methods.

Abstract: Random matrix theory has played an important role in various areas of pure mathematics, mathematical physics, and machine learning. From a practical perspective of data science, input data are usually normalized prior to processing. Thus, this study investigates the statistical properties of min-max normalized eigenvalues in random matrices. Previously, the effective distribution for such normalized eigenvalues has been proposed. In this study, we apply it to evaluate a scaling law of the cumulative distribution. Furthermore, we derive the residual error that arises during matrix factorization of random matrices. We conducted numerical experiments to verify these theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) evolve along distinct paths but converge in the design of Dyna-Q [1]. However, modern RL methods still struggle with effective transferability across tasks and scenarios. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a generalized algorithm, Feature Model-Based Enhanced Actor-Critic (FM-EAC), that integrates planning, acting, and learning for multi-task control in dynamic environments. FM-EAC combines the strengths of MBRL and MFRL and improves generalizability through the use of novel feature-based models and an enhanced actor-critic framework. Simulations in both urban and agricultural applications demonstrate that FM-EAC consistently outperforms many state-of-the-art MBRL and MFRL methods. More importantly, different sub-networks can be customized within FM-EAC according to user-specific requirements.

Conclusion: DHMBPO能解决滚动长度选择的冲突，在连续控制基准测试中有更好表现。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) reduces the cost of real-environment sampling by generating synthetic trajectories (called rollouts) from a learned dynamics model. However, choosing the length of the rollouts poses two dilemmas: (1) Longer rollouts better preserve on-policy training but amplify model bias, indicating the need for an intermediate horizon to mitigate distribution shift (i.e., the gap between on-policy and past off-policy samples). (2) Moreover, a longer model rollout may reduce value estimation bias but raise the variance of policy gradients due to backpropagation through multiple steps, implying another intermediate horizon for stable gradient estimates. However, these two optimal horizons may differ. To resolve this conflict, we propose Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO), which divides the rollout procedure into a long "distribution rollout" (DR) and a short "training rollout" (TR). The DR generates on-policy state samples for mitigating distribution shift. In contrast, the short TR leverages differentiable transitions to offer accurate value gradient estimation with stable gradient updates, thereby requiring fewer updates and reducing overall runtime. We demonstrate that the double-horizon approach effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, and surpasses existing MBRL methods on continuous-control benchmarks in terms of both sample efficiency and runtime.

Abstract: Large scale text-to-image generation models can memorize and reproduce their training dataset. Since the training dataset often contains copyrighted material, reproduction of training dataset poses a copyright infringement risk, which could result in legal liabilities and financial losses for both the AI user and the developer. The current works explores the potential of chain-of-thought and task instruction prompting in reducing copyrighted content generation. To this end, we present a formulation that combines these two techniques with two other copyright mitigation strategies: a) negative prompting, and b) prompt re-writing. We study the generated images in terms their similarity to a copyrighted image and their relevance of the user input. We present numerical experiments on a variety of models and provide insights on the effectiveness of the aforementioned techniques for varying model complexity.

Abstract: Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) pose a significant threat to Federated Learning (FL) systems by enabling adversaries to infer sensitive training data from local clients. Despite extensive research, the question of how to characterize and assess the risk of DRAs in FL systems remains unresolved due to the lack of a theoretically-grounded risk quantification framework. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to quantify the maximum achievable effectiveness of DRAs for a given data instance and FL model. We derive a tight and computable upper bound for InvLoss and explore its implications from three perspectives. First, we show that DRA risk is governed by the spectral properties of the Jacobian matrix of exchanged model updates or feature embeddings, providing a unified explanation for the effectiveness of defense methods. Second, we develop InvRE, an InvLoss-based DRA risk estimator that offers attack method-agnostic, comprehensive risk evaluation across data instances and model architectures. Third, we propose two adaptive noise perturbation defenses that enhance FL privacy without harming classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate our framework, demonstrating its potential for systematic DRA risk evaluation and mitigation in FL systems.

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings, e.g. as decision support systems in various societal sectors or in critical infrastructure, designers and auditors are facing the need to ensure that models satisfy a wider variety of requirements (e.g. compliance with regulations, fairness, computational constraints) beyond performance. Although most of them are the subject of ongoing studies, typical approaches face critical challenges: post-processing methods tend to compromise performance, which is often counteracted by fine-tuning or, worse, training from scratch, an often time-consuming or even unavailable strategy. This raises the following question: "Can we efficiently edit models to satisfy requirements, without sacrificing their utility?" In this work, we approach this with a unifying framework, in a data-driven manner, i.e. we learn to edit neural networks (NNs), where the editor is an NN itself - a graph metanetwork - and editing amounts to a single inference step. In particular, the metanetwork is trained on NN populations to minimise an objective consisting of two terms: the requirement to be enforced and the preservation of the NN's utility. We experiment with diverse tasks (the data minimisation principle, bias mitigation and weight pruning) improving the trade-offs between performance, requirement satisfaction and time efficiency compared to popular post-processing or re-training alternatives.

Abstract: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) are combining recent technological advances in robotics, automation, and machine learning based data analysis and decision-making to perform autonomous experimentation toward human-directed goals without requiring any direct human intervention. SDLs are successfully used in materials science, chemistry, and beyond, to optimise processes, materials, and devices in a systematic and data-efficient way. At present, the most widely used algorithm to identify the most informative next experiment is Bayesian optimisation. While relatively simple to apply to a wide range of optimisation problems, standard Bayesian optimisation relies on a fixed experimental workflow with a clear set of optimisation parameters and one or more measurable objective functions. This excludes the possibility of making on-the-fly decisions about changes in the planned sequence of operations and including intermediate measurements in the decision-making process. Therefore, many real-world experiments need to be adapted and simplified to be converted to the common setting in self-driving labs. In this paper, we introduce an extension to Bayesian optimisation that allows flexible sampling of multi-stage workflows and makes optimal decisions based on intermediate observables, which we call proxy measurements. We systematically compare the advantage of taking into account proxy measurements over conventional Bayesian optimisation, in which only the final measurement is observed. We find that over a wide range of scenarios, proxy measurements yield a substantial improvement, both in the time to find good solutions and in the overall optimality of found solutions. This not only paves the way to use more complex and thus more realistic experimental workflows in autonomous labs but also to smoothly combine simulations and experiments in the next generation of SDLs.

As a byproduct of our approach, for each dataset, we also obtain an assessment of the relative importance of uncertainty and robustness as sources of unreliability.

Abstract: Understanding the temporal evolution of sets of vectors is a fundamental challenge across various domains, including ecology, crime analysis, and linguistics. For instance, ecosystem structures evolve due to interactions among plants, herbivores, and carnivores; the spatial distribution of crimes shifts in response to societal changes; and word embedding vectors reflect cultural and semantic trends over time. However, analyzing such time-varying sets of vectors is challenging due to their complicated structures, which also evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling the distribution underlying each set of vectors using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes. By approximating the latent function in the Gaussian process with Random Fourier Features, we obtain compact and comparable vector representations over time. This enables us to track and visualize temporal transitions of vector sets in a low-dimensional space. We apply our method to both sociological data (crime distributions) and linguistic data (word embeddings), demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics. Our results show that the proposed approach provides interpretable and robust representations, offering a powerful framework for analyzing structural changes in temporally indexed vector sets across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 针对无标签不完全多视图数据特征与实例共同选择问题，提出 JUICE 方法，该方法将缺失数据恢复与特征实例共同选择统一，利用跨视图邻域信息，实验表明性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将特征与实例共同选择和缺失值插补视为独立过程，且合并多视图数据无法利用视图间互补信息，限制了共同选择效果。

Method: 提出 JUICE 方法，先利用可用观测值重构不完全多视图数据，将缺失数据恢复和特征实例共同选择放在统一框架中，再利用跨视图邻域信息学习样本间关系来细化缺失值插补。

Result: 广泛实验证明 JUICE 优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JUICE 方法能够有效解决无标签不完全多视图数据的特征与实例共同选择问题。

Abstract: Feature and instance co-selection, which aims to reduce both feature dimensionality and sample size by identifying the most informative features and instances, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, when dealing with unlabeled incomplete multi-view data, where some samples are missing in certain views, existing methods typically first impute the missing data and then concatenate all views into a single dataset for subsequent co-selection. Such a strategy treats co-selection and missing data imputation as two independent processes, overlooking potential interactions between them. The inter-sample relationships gleaned from co-selection can aid imputation, which in turn enhances co-selection performance. Additionally, simply merging multi-view data fails to capture the complementary information among views, ultimately limiting co-selection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel co-selection method, termed Joint learning of Unsupervised multI-view feature and instance Co-selection with cross-viEw imputation (JUICE). JUICE first reconstructs incomplete multi-view data using available observations, bringing missing data recovery and feature and instance co-selection together in a unified framework. Then, JUICE leverages cross-view neighborhood information to learn inter-sample relationships and further refine the imputation of missing values during reconstruction. This enables the selection of more representative features and instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JUICE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升扩散语言模型的纠错能力和完成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion language models are structurally well-suited for iterative error correction, as their non-causal denoising dynamics allow arbitrary positions in a sequence to be revised. However, standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training fails to reliably induce this behavior, as models often cannot identify unreliable tokens in a complete input, rendering confidence-guided refinement ineffective. We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB), a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and controlled settings demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs in correction scenarios, while also improving pure completion performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangshuibai/CDLM.

Conclusion: N - 单纯形注意力机制在拓展交互方面有进展，但也面临过平滑挑战，需进一步研究解决。

Abstract: Going from pure Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to a learnable graph message-passing mechanism at each layer has been foundational to state-of-the-art results, despite the computational trade-off (e.g. GATs or Transformers). To go a step further, in this work, we introduce N-simplicial attention, going from pairwise token similarity to higher-order interactions, and adapt it for Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). To help manage the increased complexity, we propose a cost-effective simplex selection enabling the model to focus its computation load onto the more task-sensitive interactions. Beyond these core mechanisms, we study how smoothing N-simplicial attention is by deriving a Lipschitz upper-bound and by demonstrating that by itself it also suffers from over-smoothing, despite opening the attention message-passing to higher-order interactions.

Conclusion: 行为标记捕获细粒度语义，为将复杂行为模式集成到大型语言模型提供即插即用接口。

Abstract: Recent advances in explainable recommendations have explored the integration of language models to analyze natural language rationales for user-item interactions. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on ID-based representations that obscure semantic meaning and impose structural constraints on language models, thereby limiting their applicability in open-ended scenarios. These challenges are intensified by the complex nature of real-world interactions, where diverse user intents are entangled and collaborative signals rarely align with linguistic semantics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BEAT, a unified and transferable framework that tokenizes user and item behaviors into discrete, interpretable sequences. We construct a behavior vocabulary via a vector-quantized autoencoding process that disentangles macro-level interests and micro-level intentions from graph-based representations. We then introduce multi-level semantic supervision to bridge the gap between behavioral signals and language space. A semantic alignment regularization mechanism is designed to embed behavior tokens directly into the input space of frozen language models. Experiments on three public datasets show that BEAT improves zero-shot recommendation performance while generating coherent and informative explanations. Further analysis demonstrates that our behavior tokens capture fine-grained semantics and offer a plug-and-play interface for integrating complex behavior patterns into large language models.

Abstract: The multi-step denoising process in diffusion and Flow Matching models causes major efficiency issues, which motivates research on few-step generation. We present Solution Flow Models (SoFlow), a framework for one-step generation from scratch. By analyzing the relationship between the velocity function and the solution function of the velocity ordinary differential equation (ODE), we propose a Flow Matching loss and a solution consistency loss to train our models. The Flow Matching loss allows our models to provide estimated velocity fields for Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) during training, which improves generation performance. Notably, our consistency loss does not require the calculation of the Jacobian-vector product (JVP), a common requirement in recent works that is not well-optimized in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. Experimental results indicate that, when trained from scratch using the same Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture and an equal number of training epochs, our models achieve better FID-50K scores than MeanFlow models on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset.

Conclusion: 该方法无需校准水力模型，适用于实际运营环境。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework, for the detection, classification, and preliminary localization of anomalies in water distribution networks using multivariate statistical analysis. The approach, termed SICAMS (Statistical Identification and Classification of Anomalies in Mahalanobis Space), processes heterogeneous pressure and flow sensor data through a whitening transformation to eliminate spatial correlations among measurements. Based on the transformed data, the Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic is constructed, enabling the formulation of anomaly detection as a statistical hypothesis test of network conformity to normal operating conditions. It is shown that Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic can serve as an integral indicator of the overall "health" of the system, exhibiting correlation with total leakage volume, and thereby enabling approximate estimation of water losses via a regression model. A heuristic algorithm is developed to analyze the $T^2$ time series and classify detected anomalies into abrupt leaks, incipient leaks, and sensor malfunctions. Furthermore, a coarse leak localization method is proposed, which ranks sensors according to their statistical contribution and employs Laplacian interpolation to approximate the affected region within the network. Application of the proposed framework to the BattLeDIM L-Town benchmark dataset demonstrates high sensitivity and reliability in leak detection, maintaining robust performance even under multiple leaks. These capabilities make the method applicable to real-world operational environments without the need for a calibrated hydraulic model.

Conclusion: 策略自身的更新空间为大语言模型强化学习的探索提供了更可靠有效的基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become essential for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet current exploration mechanisms remain fundamentally misaligned with how these models actually learn. Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods. Analyzing the induced geometry, we find that G2RL expands exploration into substantially more orthogonal and often opposing gradient directions while maintaining semantic coherence, revealing that a policy own update space provides a far more faithful and effective basis for guiding exploration in large language model reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to transmit information most relevant to a task rather than raw data, offering significant gains in communication efficiency for applications such as telepresence, augmented reality, and remote sensing. Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information. This flexible and goal-driven design enables efficient semantic communication in complex and bandwidth-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为外部干预下生物有机体间不断演变的相互作用学习提供了一个框架。

Abstract: In a mathematical model of interacting biological organisms, where external interventions may alter behavior over time, traditional models that assume fixed parameters usually do not capture the evolving dynamics. In oncology, this is further exacerbated by the fact that experimental data are often sparse and sometimes are composed of a few time points of tumor volume. In this paper, we propose to learn time-varying interactions between cells, such as those of bladder cancer tumors and immune cells, and their response to a combination of anticancer treatments in a limited data scenario. We employ the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach to predict possible subpopulation trajectories at time points where no observed data are available. We demonstrate that our approach is consistent with the biological explanation of subpopulation trajectories. Our method provides a framework for learning evolving interactions among biological organisms when external interventions are applied to their environment.

Abstract: Current deep learning approaches for physiological signal monitoring suffer from static topologies and constant energy consumption. We introduce SGEMAS (Self-Growing Ephemeral Multi-Agent System), a bio-inspired architecture that treats intelligence as a dynamic thermodynamic process. By coupling a structural plasticity mechanism (agent birth death) to a variational free energy objective, the system naturally evolves to minimize prediction error with extreme sparsity. An ablation study on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database reveals that adding a multi-scale instability index to the agent dynamics significantly improves performance. In a challenging inter-patient, zero-shot setting, the final SGEMAS v3.3 model achieves a mean AUC of 0.570 +- 0.070, outperforming both its simpler variants and a standard autoencoder baseline. This result validates that a physics-based, energy-constrained model can achieve robust unsupervised anomaly detection, offering a promising direction for efficient biomedical AI.

Conclusion: 耦合振荡器电路可作为具有自主连续学习能力的基于能量的神经形态计算硬件平台。

Abstract: We present an oscillatory neuromorphic primitive implemented with networks of coupled Wien bridge oscillators and tunable resistive couplings. Phase relationships between oscillators encode patterns, and a local Hebbian learning rule continuously adapts the couplings, allowing learning and recall to emerge from the same ongoing analog dynamics rather than from separate training and inference phases. Using a Kuramoto-style phase model with an effective energy function, we show that learned phase patterns form attractor states and validate this behavior in simulation and hardware. We further realize a 2-4-2 architecture with a hidden layer of oscillators, whose bipartite visible-hidden coupling allows multiple internal configurations to produce the same visible phase states. When inputs are switched, transient spikes in energy followed by relaxation indicate how the network can reduce surprise by reshaping its energy landscape. These results support coupled oscillator circuits as a hardware platform for energy-based neuromorphic computing with autonomous, continuous learning.

Abstract: The increasing computational demands of modern AI systems have exposed fundamental limitations of digital hardware, driving interest in alternative paradigms for efficient large-scale inference. Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM) is a family of models that offers a flexible framework for representing many contemporary neural architectures, such as transformers and diffusion models, by casting them as dynamical systems evolving on an energy landscape. In this work, we propose a general method for building analog accelerators for DenseAMs and implementing them using electronic RC circuits, crossbar arrays, and amplifiers. We find that our analog DenseAM hardware performs inference in constant time independent of model size. This result highlights an asymptotic advantage of analog DenseAMs over digital numerical solvers that scale at least linearly with the model size. We consider three settings of progressively increasing complexity: XOR, the Hamming (7,4) code, and a simple language model defined on binary variables. We propose analog implementations of these three models and analyze the scaling of inference time, energy consumption, and hardware. Finally, we estimate lower bounds on the achievable time constants imposed by amplifier specifications, suggesting that even conservative existing analog technology can enable inference times on the order of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds. By harnessing the intrinsic parallelism and continuous-time operation of analog circuits, our DenseAM-based accelerator design offers a new avenue for fast and scalable AI hardware.

Abstract: Data-driven evolutionary algorithms has shown surprising results in addressing expensive optimization problems through robust surrogate modeling. Though promising, existing surrogate modeling schemes may encounter limitations in complex optimization problems with many sub-objectives, which rely on repeated and tedious approximation. To address such technical gap, we propose Q-MetaSur as a plug-and-play surrogate modeling scheme capable of providing unified and generalized surrogate learning. Specifically, we consider multi-task-multi-objective optimization~(MTMOO) in offline setting. Several key designs are proposed: 1) we transform objective approximation into sequence-to-sequence modeling where MTMOO problem can be represented by tenxual tokenization. To operate under such auto-regressive modeling, we introduce a Large Language Model-based surrogate model that first encodes a MTMOO instance and then decodes objective values of unseen decision variables. To ensure stability in training the proposed model, we propose a two-stage offline training strategy that operates as a synergy of supervised tuning and RL fine-tuning, which first exploits offline dataset to fit existing knowledge and then leverages RL to enhance model's generalization performance. Extensive empirical results on the CEC2019 benchmark demonstrate that Q-MetaSur not only outperforms representative surrogate baselines in objective approximation accuracy, but also helps underlying evolutionary algorithms achieve both desired optimization convergence and improved pareto optimality.

Abstract: Modern software development relies on package ecosystems where a single declared dependency can pull in many additional transitive packages. This dependency amplification, defined as the ratio of transitive to direct dependencies, has major implications for software supply chain security, yet amplification patterns across ecosystems have not been compared at scale. We present an empirical study of 500 projects across ten major ecosystems, including Maven Central for Java, npm Registry for JavaScript, crates io for Rust, PyPI for Python, NuGet Gallery for dot NET, RubyGems for Ruby, Go Modules for Go, Packagist for PHP, CocoaPods for Swift and Objective C, and Pub for Dart. Our analysis shows that Maven exhibits mean amplification of 24.70 times, compared to 4.48 times for Go Modules, 4.32 times for npm, and 0.32 times for CocoaPods. We find significant differences with large effect sizes in 22 of 45 pairwise comparisons, challenging the assumption that npm has the highest amplification due to its many small purpose packages. We observe that 28 percent of Maven projects exceed 10 times amplification, indicating a systematic pattern rather than isolated outliers, compared to 14 percent for RubyGems, 12 percent for npm, and zero percent for Cargo, PyPI, Packagist, CocoaPods, and Pub. We attribute these differences to ecosystem design choices such as dependency resolution behavior, standard library completeness, and platform constraints. Our findings suggest adopting ecosystem specific security strategies, including systematic auditing for Maven environments, targeted outlier detection for npm and RubyGems, and continuation of current practices for ecosystems with controlled amplification. We provide a full replication package with data and analysis scripts.

Abstract: Value Driver Trees (VDTs) are conceptual models used to illustrate and analyse the causal relationships between key performance indicators and business outcomes, thereby supporting managerial decision-making and value-based management. Despite their increasing application, there are still no systematic guidelines for the modelling of such conceptual models. To fill this gap, this study introduces the Value Driver Modelling Notation (VDMN), a graphical notation developed to systematically guide VDT modelling. This notation includes a comprehensive set of semantic constructs and an intuitive graphical syntax. To evaluate its practical utility, the VDMN was applied in two case studies and assessed through expert interviews. The results show that the notation supports a consistent and comprehensible modelling of VDTs. The VDMN thus represents a significant step towards the systematisation and standardisation of VDT modelling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在基准测试得分高，但在现实应用中可靠性不足，需研究模型在细微差别提示下的表现。

Method: 引入新指标reliable@k，开发数据增强自动管道生成高质量相似提示，构建IFEval++进行评估。

Result: 20个专有和26个开源大语言模型在细微差别提示下性能最多下降61.8%。

Conclusion: 面向细微差别的可靠性是提升大语言模型可靠性和可信度的关键且待探索的方向。

Abstract: Advanced LLMs have achieved near-ceiling instruction-following accuracy on benchmarks such as IFEval. However, these impressive scores do not necessarily translate to reliable services in real-world use, where users often vary their phrasing, contextual framing, and task formulations. In this paper, we study nuance-oriented reliability: whether models exhibit consistent competence across cousin prompts that convey analogous user intents but with subtle nuances. To quantify this, we introduce a new metric, reliable@k, and develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. Building upon this, we construct IFEval++ for systematic evaluation. Across 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs, we find that current models exhibit substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability -- their performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications. What's more, we characterize it and explore three potential improvement recipes. Our findings highlight nuance-oriented reliability as a crucial yet underexplored next step toward more dependable and trustworthy LLM behavior. Our code and benchmark are accessible: https://github.com/jianshuod/IFEval-pp.

TL;DR: 本文通过对68名开发者的调查，研究协助隐私法合规的开发者需求及影响因素，结果显示开发者需要更多自动化工具，隐私经验会增加对隐私工具的关注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未考察协助隐私法合规的新兴开发者需求，而了解这些需求对开发自动化工具很重要。

Method: 开展有68名开发者参与的调查，研究相关需求及影响因素。

Result: 多数开发者需要更多自动化工具，隐私经验增加从业者对隐私工具的关注。

Conclusion: 研究结果可帮助从业者更好定位隐私法合规开发活动，凸显对隐私促进者的迫切需求。

Abstract: Data privacy legislation, such as GDPR and CCPA/CPRA, has rendered data privacy law compliance a requirement of all software systems. Developers need to implement various kinds of functionalities to cover law needs, including user rights and law principles. As data compliance is tightly coupled with legal knowledge, it is not always easy to perform such integrations in software systems. Prior studies have focused on developers' understanding of privacy principles, such as Privacy by Design, and have examined privacy techniques used in the software industry. Nevertheless, emerging developer needs that can assist in privacy law compliance have not been examined but are useful in understanding what development automation tools, such as Generative AI, need to cover to make the compliance process more straightforward and seamless within the development process. In this work, we present a survey that examines the above needs with the participation of 68 developers, while we have examined which factors affect practitioners' needs. Most developers express a need for more automated tools, while privacy experience increases practitioners' concerns for privacy tools. Our results can assist practitioners in better positioning their development activities within privacy law compliance and point to an urgent need for privacy facilitators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统缺乏表达和执行需求的方法，高智能模型在部署中常失败。

Method: 引入能力工程，通过CAPE协议实现Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train循环。

Result: 在六个领域109,500个示例中，CAPE相对DPO降低违规率81%，降低成本5到20倍，缩短周期从数月到数周。

Conclusion: 发布CAPE协议等工具，推出CapabilityBench评估平台，推动评估向能力测量转变。

Abstract: Modern AI systems lack a way to express and enforce requirements. Pre-training produces intelligence, and post-training optimizes preferences, but neither guarantees that models reliably satisfy explicit, context-dependent constraints. This missing abstraction explains why highly intelligent models routinely fail in deployment despite strong benchmark performance.
  We introduce Capability Engineering, the systematic practice of converting requirements into executable specifications and training models to satisfy them by default. We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.
  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent). By replacing per-example annotation with reusable specifications, CAPE reduces costs by 5 to 20 times and shortens timelines from months to weeks.
  We release the CAPE protocol, PredicateGraph schema, CPL specification language, and policy packs under Apache 2.0. We also launch CapabilityBench, a public registry of model evaluations against community-contributed policies, shifting evaluation from intelligence benchmarks toward capability measurement.

TL;DR: 对比两种LLM驱动的MATLAB到HDL管道语法修复方法，发现代理方法更有效，尤其对中小模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在HDL代码训练有限，端到端转换易出错，需研究语法修复方法。

Method: 比较结构化专家设计流程和基于MCP的自主代理方法对42个MATLAB信号处理函数进行语法修复。

Result: 代理方法更能解决初始语法错误，在中型模型上使仿真到达率提高超20个百分点。

Conclusion: 设计合理的代理框架能有效弥补中小模型的能力限制。

Abstract: Translating algorithms from high-level languages like MATLAB to hardware description languages (HDLs) is a resource-intensive but necessary step for deployment on FPGAs and ASICs. While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points. We hypothesize the gains come from short prompts, aggressive context management, and conditional tool use. Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success. Our findings suggest that these agentic frameworks, when properly designed, are most effective at compensating for the capacity limits of small and mid-sized models.

Conclusion: 虽无通用应用方法，但初步发现和挑战能为未来研究提供有意义的指导。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform the research process by automating the discovery of new solutions. This shift depends on the availability of reliable verifiers, which AI-driven approaches require to validate candidate solutions. Research focused on improving systems performance is especially well-suited to this paradigm because system performance problems naturally admit such verifiers: candidates can be implemented in real systems or simulators and evaluated against predefined workloads. We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight. Note: This paper is an extension of our prior work [14]. It adds extensive evaluation across multiple ADRS frameworks and provides deeper analysis and insights into best practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准不能代表现实代码复杂性，评估大语言模型泛化性存在问题，需更真实评估。

Method: 提出含1101个推理问题的RE2 - Bench基准，利用程序分析处理复杂类型，用多数投票机制分类问题难度。

Result: 用RE2 - Bench评估六个大语言模型，输入和输出预测任务中难题表现大幅下降。

Conclusion: 先前评估大幅高估大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Code reasoning tasks are becoming prevalent in large language model (LLM) assessments. Existing benchmarks involve simple programs, failing to represent real-world complexities such as inter- or intra-procedural dependencies, core or third-party API calls, highly nested constructs, and non-primitive complex types. Evaluating LLMs under such a simplistic setting poses a significant threat to assumptions about their generalizability in practice. To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects. RE2-Bench leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize and deserialize compound, complex, and custom types in real-world code, going far beyond the primitive-only settings used in prior work.
  A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\% for input prediction and 42.15\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL应用存在诸多bug、故障和漏洞，手动重现这些bug因模型的非确定性及与环境的紧密耦合而极其困难，现有手动方法可靠重现率低。

Method: 提出RepGen方法，构建学习增强的上下文，制定全面的bug重现计划，采用迭代生成 - 验证 - 改进机制，并使用大语言模型生成重现bug的代码。

Result: 在106个真实世界的DL bug上实现了80.19%的重现率，比现有技术提高了19.81%；开发者研究表明，RepGen使DL bug重现成功率提高23.35%，重现时间减少56.8%，降低了参与者的认知负担。

Conclusion: RepGen是一种有效、自动化且智能的DL bug重现方法，能显著提升bug重现的效率和成功率。

Abstract: Despite their wide adoption in various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, software engineering), Deep Learning (DL)-based applications suffer from many bugs, failures, and vulnerabilities. Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.

Method: 整理GitHub讨论中有毒和无毒线程数据集，用两步提示管道构建LLM框架，先生成对话动态摘要，再估计脱轨可能性。

Result: 在Qwen和Llama模型上F1分数分别达0.901和0.852，外部验证F1分数达0.797，优于既定NLP基线。

Conclusion: 结构化LLM提示对开源软件对话脱轨早期检测有效，可实现主动且可解释的moderation。

Abstract: Toxic interactions in Open Source Software (OSS) communities reduce contributor engagement and threaten project sustainability. Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold. However, most proactive moderation strategies are manual, requiring significant time and effort from community maintainers. To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.
  We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of structured LLM prompting for early detection of conversational derailment in OSS, enabling proactive and explainable moderation.

Conclusion: BODE - GEN方法可有效提高大语言模型代码生成的准确性，且所需迭代次数少。

Abstract: We consider the task of generating functionally correct code using large language models (LLMs). The correctness of generated code is influenced by the prompt used to query the given base LLM. We formulate the problem of finding the appropriate prompt as combinatorial search process and propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach referred to as {\em BO for Code GENeration (BODE-GEN)}. BODE-GEN performs an adaptive data-driven search over prompts guided by training data in the form of prompts tried and the functional accuracy of the generated code over a set of given test cases. The key insight is to perform BO in continuous embedding space by using an auxiliary LLM to bridge the gap between discrete prompt space and continuous embedding space. We leverage two synergistic ideas, namely, random projections and dimensionality scaled priors, to build effective Gaussian process based surrogate models over the high-dimensional embedding space. Our experiments on the HumanEval+ benchmark using multiple base LLMs show that BODE-GEN can improve performance in terms of code generation accuracy compared to fixed prompts and manual prompt engineering. Additionally, we demonstrate that BODE-GEN is sample-efficient, requiring relatively few iterations of BO to demonstrate improvements in code accuracy.

Conclusion: 引导学术研究关注这些重要但未充分探索的问题，提升对工业的影响力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally reshaping software engineering (SE), driving a paradigm shift in both academic research and industrial practice. While top-tier SE venues continue to show sustained or emerging focus on areas like automated testing and program repair, with researchers worldwide reporting continuous performance gains, the alignment of these academic advances with real industrial needs remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 1,367 papers published in FSE, ASE, and ICSE between 2022 and 2025, identifying key research topics, commonly used benchmarks, industrial relevance, and open-source availability. We then carry out an empirical survey across 17 organizations, collecting 282 responses on six prominent topics, i.e., program analysis, automated testing, code generation/completion, issue resolution, pre-trained code models, and dependency management, through structured questionnaires. By contrasting academic capabilities with industrial feedback, we derive seven critical implications, highlighting under-addressed challenges in software requirements and architecture, the reliability and explainability of intelligent SE approaches, input assumptions in academic research, practical evaluation tensions, and ethical considerations. This study aims to refocus academic attention on these important yet under-explored problems and to guide future SE research toward greater industrial impact.

Conclusion: 所设计的工具和方法推进了BPMN+DMN流程正确性验证的技术水平。

Abstract: The increasing and widespread use of BPMN business processes, also embodying DMN tables, requires tools and methodologies to verify their correctness. However, most commonly used frameworks to build BPMN+DMN models only allow designers to detect syntactical errors, thus ignoring semantic (behavioural) faults. This forces business processes designers to manually run single executions of their BPMN+DMN processes using proprietary tools in order to detect failures. Furthermore, how proprietary tools translate a BPMN+DMN process to a computer simulation is left unspecified. In this paper, we advance this state of the art by designing a tool, named BDTransTest providing: i) a translation from a BPMN + DMN process B to a Java program P ; ii) the synthesis and execution of a testing plan for B, that may require the business designer to disambiguate some input domain; iii) the analysis of the coverage achieved by the testing plan in terms of nodes and edges of B. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of our methodology on BPMN+DMN processes from the literature.

Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology integrates heterogeneous data and models, along with semantic technologies to create multi-layered digital representation of physical systems. DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency. A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues. Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs. The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers. It integrates: (i) adaptive conformance mechanisms that link metamodels with evolving models and (ii) a large language model (LLM) validated alignment process that grounds metamodels in domain knowledge, ensuring structural fidelity and conceptual consistency throughout the DT lifecycle. This approach automates semantic correspondences discovery, minimizes manual mapping, and enhances scalability across diverse model types. We illustrate the approach using air quality use case and validate its performance using different test cases from Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) remains a critical challenge, as traditional verification methods such as large-scale on-road testing are prohibitively costly and time-consuming.To address this,scenario-based testing has emerged as a scalable and efficient alternative,yet existing surveys provide only partial coverage of recent methodological and technological advances.This review systematically analyzes 31 primary studies,and 10 surveys identified through a comprehensive search spanning 2015~2025;however,the in-depth methodological synthesis and comparative evaluation focus primarily on recent frameworks(2023~2025),reflecting the surge of Artificial Intelligent(AI)-assisted and multimodal approaches in this period.Traditional approaches rely on expert knowledge,ontologies,and naturalistic driving or accident data,while recent developments leverage generative models,including large language models,generative adversarial networks,diffusion models,and reinforcement learning frameworks,to synthesize diverse and safety-critical scenarios.Our synthesis identifies three persistent gaps:the absence of standardized evaluation metrics,limited integration of ethical and human factors,and insufficient coverage of multimodal and Operational Design Domain (ODD)-specific scenarios.To address these challenges,this review contributes a refined taxonomy that incorporates multimodal extensions,an ethical and safety checklist for responsible scenario design,and an ODD coverage map with a scenario-difficulty schema to enable transparent benchmarking.Collectively,these contributions provide methodological clarity for researchers and practical guidance for industry,supporting reproducible evaluation and accelerating the safe deployment of higher-level ADS.

Method: 提出包无关方法Aletheia，利用抄袭检测领域算法剖析JavaScript捆绑包来识别包版本。

Conclusion: 定量指标不能完整反映情况，少数广泛使用的供应商可能是及时更新的主要驱动力。

Abstract: Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture.

Motivation: 现有AAS方法将其视为静态信息模型，缺乏动态服务集成和系统适应支持，且未充分探索集成可执行行为的潜力。

Method: 提出基于子模型的架构，通过扩展子模型并引入行为定义，形成模块化事件驱动架构，根据嵌入式触发条件部署容器化服务。

Result: 通过3轴铣床的案例研究展示了该方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法使AAS不仅是被动数字表示，还能作为执行增值服务的主动接口，为数字孪生环境的AI驱动适应和系统级智能奠定基础。

Abstract: In manufacturing, digital twins, realized as Asset Administration Shells (AAS), have emerged as a prevalent practice. These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine. Our contribution enables the AAS to serve not only as a passive digital representation but also as an active interface for executing added-value services.%, thereby laying the foundation for future AI-driven adaptation and system-level intelligence in digital twin environments.

TL;DR: 研究提出多主观排名评估方法，用代码审查数据集评估ChatGPT评论质量，结果显示其优于人类评论，该方法有助于评估生成式AI性能并提高风险意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码审查生成评估方法存在依赖单一标准答案或主观‘有用性’概念模糊的问题，需新评估方法。

Method: 提出多主观排名评估方法，利用包含280个代码审查请求及对应评论的数据集，让多位人类评判者对ChatGPT生成评论和平台上人类最佳回复进行质量排名。

Result: ChatGPT的评论排名显著优于人类评论，甚至超过StackExchange的已采纳答案。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能对生成式AI在代码审查中的表现进行更有意义的评估，同时提高对其无节制集成到审查流程潜在风险的认识。

Abstract: The use of large language models like ChatGPT in code review offers promising efficiency gains but also raises concerns about correctness and safety. Existing evaluation methods for code review generation either rely on automatic comparisons to a single ground truth, which fails to capture the variability of human perspectives, or on subjective assessments of "usefulness", a highly ambiguous concept. We propose a novel evaluation approach based on what we call multi-subjective ranking. Using a dataset of 280 self-contained code review requests and corresponding comments from CodeReview StackExchange, multiple human judges ranked the quality of ChatGPT-generated comments alongside the top human responses from the platform. Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers. Going further, our proposed method motivates and enables more meaningful assessments of generative AI's performance in code review, while also raising awareness of potential risks of unchecked integration into review processes.

Motivation: 代码大模型依赖大量代码数据引发知识产权合规和未经授权使用受限代码担忧，现有MI检测技术有效性可能被语义等效代码转换技术削弱，研究转换规则能否规避MI检测。

Method: 系统调查语义等效代码转换规则，进行结果分析并开展因果分析。

Result: 每条规则最坏情况模型准确率仅下降1.5%，转换数据集可作微调替代品；规则RenameVariable使MI成功率降低10.19%；多规则组合不能进一步降低MI有效性。

Conclusion: 基于转换的混淆技术可大幅削弱MI检测，暴露出代码大模型许可合规执行的关键漏洞。

Abstract: The success of large language models for code relies on vast amounts of code data, including public open-source repositories, such as GitHub, and private, confidential code from companies. This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.
  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为降低REST API暴露端点带来的安全风险，因端点数量多，需自动化测试技术如模糊测试。

Method: 基于LibAFL构建WuppieFuzz，支持白盒、灰盒和黑盒模糊测试，利用OpenAPI规范生成初始输入语料，用特定变异器变异，按覆盖率选择请求序列，自动创建测试框架，提供多种报告。

Result: 在Petstore API上评估白盒方法健壮性和不同功率调度有效性，监测端点和代码覆盖率。

Conclusion: 未明确提及，但暗示WuppieFuzz在REST API模糊测试中有一定作用。

Abstract: Many business processes currently depend on web services, often using REST APIs for communication. REST APIs expose web service functionality through endpoints, allowing easy client interaction over the Internet. To reduce the security risk resulting from exposed endpoints, thorough testing is desired. Due to the generally vast number of endpoints, automated testing techniques, like fuzzing, are of interest.
  This paper introduces WuppieFuzz, an open-source REST API fuzzer built on LibAFL, supporting white-box, grey-box and black-box fuzzing. Using an OpenAPI specification, it can generate an initial input corpus consisting of sequences of requests. These are mutated with REST-specific and LibAFL-provided mutators to explore different code paths in the software under test. Guided by the measured coverage, WuppieFuzz then selects which request sequences to send next to reach complex states in the software under test. In this process, it automates harness creation to reduce manual efforts often required in fuzzing. Different kinds of reporting are provided by the fuzzer to help fixing bugs.
  We evaluated our tool on the Petstore API to assess the robustness of the white-box approach and the effectiveness of different power schedules. We further monitored endpoint and code coverage over time to measure the efficacy of the approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前特定问题加速器开发存在“双语言问题”，算法和内核实现使用不同语言，需要统一开发流程。

Method: 提出基于MLIR的编译器工具链，自动将Julia编写的内核编译成SystemVerilog，支持动态和静态调度，集成AXI4 - Stream协议。

Result: 原型工具链能在真实FPGA设备上以100MHz运行信号处理/数学基准测试，达到先进工具链吞吐量的59.71% - 82.6%。

Conclusion: 该工具链让领域专家能用Julia编写计算内核并直接移植到FPGA，无需额外修改。

Abstract: With the push towards Exascale computing and data-driven methods, problem sizes have increased dramatically, increasing the computational requirements of the underlying algorithms. This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the "two-language problem": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++. Overall, this toolchain allows domain experts to write compute kernels in Julia as they normally would, and then retarget them to an FPGA without additional pragmas or modifications.

Motivation: 使视觉语言模型能以渐进、由简到繁的方式通过问题链进行推理，提升在金融领域的视觉理解和推理能力。

Method: 提出PyFi框架，构建PyFi - 600K数据集；使用PyFi - adv多智能体对抗机制合成数据；对先进VLMs进行评估；在金字塔结构问题链上微调Qwen2.5 - VL - 3B和Qwen2.5 - VL - 7B模型。

Conclusion: PyFi框架及相关方法能有效提升视觉语言模型在金融领域处理复杂问题的能力，代码、数据集和模型资源公开。

Abstract: This paper proposes PyFi, a novel framework for pyramid-like financial image understanding that enables vision language models (VLMs) to reason through question chains in a progressive, simple-to-complex manner. At the core of PyFi is PyFi-600K, a dataset comprising 600K financial question-answer pairs organized into a reasoning pyramid: questions at the base require only basic perception, while those toward the apex demand increasing levels of capability in financial visual understanding and expertise. This data is scalable because it is synthesized without human annotations, using PyFi-adv, a multi-agent adversarial mechanism under the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) paradigm, in which, for each image, a challenger agent competes with a solver agent by generating question chains that progressively probe deeper capability levels in financial visual reasoning. Leveraging this dataset, we present fine-grained, hierarchical, and comprehensive evaluations of advanced VLMs in the financial domain. Moreover, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the pyramid-structured question chains enables these models to answer complex financial questions by decomposing them into sub-questions with gradually increasing reasoning demands, yielding average accuracy improvements of 19.52% and 8.06%, respectively, on the dataset.

Conclusion: VERAFI将金融领域专业知识融入推理过程，为构建符合监管合规、投资决策和风险管理严格准确性要求的可信金融AI提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Financial AI systems suffer from a critical blind spot: while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at finding relevant documents, language models still generate calculation errors and regulatory violations during reasoning, even with perfect retrieval. This paper introduces VERAFI (Verified Agentic Financial Intelligence), an agentic framework with neurosymbolic policy generation for verified financial intelligence. VERAFI combines state-of-the-art dense retrieval and cross-encoder reranking with financial tool-enabled agents and automated reasoning policies covering GAAP compliance, SEC requirements, and mathematical validation. Our comprehensive evaluation on FinanceBench demonstrates remarkable improvements: while traditional dense retrieval with reranking achieves only 52.4\% factual correctness, VERAFI's integrated approach reaches 94.7\%, an 81\% relative improvement. The neurosymbolic policy layer alone contributes a 4.3 percentage point gain over pure agentic processing, specifically targeting persistent mathematical and logical errors. By integrating financial domain expertise directly into the reasoning process, VERAFI offers a practical pathway toward trustworthy financial AI that meets the stringent accuracy demands of regulatory compliance, investment decisions, and risk management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期价格预测因不确定性是挑战，但对投资者等很重要，需开发有效预测模型。

Method: 提出IGA - SVR模型，用遗传算法选SVR最优超参数，在五个全球指数上测试，与LSTM和OGA - SVR对比。

Result: IGA - SVR比LSTM的MAPE降低19.87%，比OGA - SVR降低50.03%，LSTM执行时间约为IGA - SVR的20倍。

Conclusion: IGA - SVR在全球指数长期日价格预测中性能优越，精度高、计算高效，训练方法能兼顾长短期趋势。

Abstract: Long-term price forecasting remains a formidable challenge due to the inherent uncertainty over the long term, despite some success in short-term predictions. Nonetheless, accurate long-term forecasts are essential for high-net-worth individuals, institutional investors, and traders. The proposed improved genetic algorithm-optimized support vector regression (IGA-SVR) model is specifically designed for long-term price prediction of global indices. The performance of the IGA-SVR model is rigorously evaluated and compared against the state-of-the-art baseline models, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the forward-validating genetic algorithm optimized support vector regression (OGA-SVR). Extensive testing was conducted on the five global indices, namely Nifty, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), DAX Performance Index (DAX), Nikkei 225 (N225), and Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSE) from 2021 to 2024 of daily price prediction up to a year. Overall, the proposed IGA-SVR model achieved a reduction in MAPE by 19.87% compared to LSTM and 50.03% compared to OGA-SVR, demonstrating its superior performance in long-term daily price forecasting of global indices. Further, the execution time for LSTM was approximately 20 times higher than that of IGA-SVR, highlighting the high accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed model. The genetic algorithm selects the optimal hyperparameters of SVR by minimizing the arithmetic mean of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) calculated over the full training dataset and the most recent five years of training data. This purposefully designed training methodology adjusts for recent trends while retaining long-term trend information, thereby offering enhanced generalization compared to the LSTM and rolling-forward validation approach employed by OGA-SVR, which forgets long-term trends and suffers from recency bias.

Conclusion: 所提基于贝叶斯优化调参和分离目标解决多目标问题的方法有效，能为投资者提供更好的投资组合选择。

Abstract: DRL agents circumvent the issue of classic models in the sense that they do not make assumptions like the financial returns being normally distributed and are able to deal with any information like the ESG score if they are configured to gain a reward that makes an objective better. However, the performance of DRL agents has high variability and it is very sensible to the value of their hyperparameters. Bayesian optimization is a class of methods that are suited to the optimization of black-box functions, that is, functions whose analytical expression is unknown, are noisy and expensive to evaluate. The hyperparameter tuning problem of DRL algorithms perfectly suits this scenario. As training an agent just for one objective is a very expensive period, requiring millions of timesteps, instead of optimizing an objective being a mixture of a risk-performance metric and an ESG metric, we choose to separate the objective and solve the multi-objective scenario to obtain an optimal Pareto set of portfolios representing the best tradeoff between the Sharpe ratio and the ESG mean score of the portfolio and leaving to the investor the choice of the final portfolio. We conducted our experiments using environments encoded within the OpenAI Gym, adapted from the FinRL platform. The experiments are carried out in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the NASDAQ markets in terms of the Sharpe ratio achieved by the agent and the mean ESG score of the portfolio. We compare the performance of the obtained Pareto sets in hypervolume terms illustrating how portfolios are the best trade-off between the Sharpe ratio and mean ESG score. Also, we show the usefulness of our proposed methodology by comparing the obtained hypervolume with one achieved by a Random Search methodology on the DRL hyperparameter space.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce an extension of the partitioned local depth (PaLD) algorithm that is adapted to online applications such as semi-supervised prediction. The new algorithm we present, online PaLD, is well-suited to situations where it is a possible to pre-compute a cohesion network from a reference dataset. After $O(n^3)$ steps to construct a queryable data structure, online PaLD can extend the cohesion network to a new data point in $O(n^2)$ time. Our approach complements previous speed up approaches based on approximation and parallelism. For illustrations, we present applications to online anomaly detection and semi-supervised classification for health-care datasets.

Method: 对一些师生问题类刻画Hessian特征谱，对线性网络进行解析分析，对多项式和其他非线性网络进行数值分析。

Result: 线性网络中，大网络下谱渐近遵循缩放卡方分布与缩放Marchenko - Pastur分布的卷积；多项式激活函数网络中，Hessian矩阵的秩可视为有效参数数量；通用非线性激活函数下，Hessian矩阵总是满秩。

Conclusion: 较小的Hessian特征值决定长期学习性能。

Abstract: Near an optimal learning point of a neural network, the learning performance of gradient descent dynamics is dictated by the Hessian matrix of the loss function with respect to the network parameters. We characterize the Hessian eigenspectrum for some classes of teacher-student problems, when the teacher and student networks have matching weights, showing that the smaller eigenvalues of the Hessian determine long-time learning performance. For linear networks, we analytically establish that for large networks the spectrum asymptotically follows a convolution of a scaled chi-square distribution with a scaled Marchenko-Pastur distribution. We numerically analyse the Hessian spectrum for polynomial and other non-linear networks. Furthermore, we show that the rank of the Hessian matrix can be seen as an effective number of parameters for networks using polynomial activation functions. For a generic non-linear activation function, such as the error function, we empirically observe that the Hessian matrix is always full rank.

Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a widely used method for data integration, designed to extract latent components shared across paired high-dimensional datasets. Despite decades of practical success, a precise theoretical understanding of its behavior in high-dimensional regimes remains limited. In this paper, we study a data integration model in which two high-dimensional data matrices share a low-rank common latent structure while also containing individual-specific components. We analyze the singular vectors of the associated cross-covariance matrix using tools from random matrix theory and derive asymptotic characterizations of the alignment between estimated and true latent directions. These results provide a quantitative explanation of the reconstruction performance of the PLS variant based on Singular Value Decomposition (PLS-SVD) and identify regimes where the method exhibits counter-intuitive or limiting behavior. Building on this analysis, we compare PLS-SVD with principal component analysis applied separately to each dataset and show its asymptotic superiority in detecting the common latent subspace. Overall, our results offer a comprehensive theoretical understanding of high-dimensional PLS-SVD, clarifying both its advantages and fundamental limitations.

Motivation: 解决自然语言代码与形式语言（如Python）互操作性需手动操作的问题。

Method: 提出共享程序状态编程抽象，给出自然函数接口规范模式，并在Nightjar编程系统实现。

Result: Nightjar程序任务准确率与手动实现相当或更高（+4 - 19%），平均减少39.6%代码量，但有运行时开销（0.4 - 4.3倍手动实现运行时间）。

Conclusion: 共享程序状态抽象能有效实现自然语言代码与程序状态互操作，Nightjar系统有一定优势但存在运行时开销。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new type of programming: natural language programming. By writing prompts that direct LLMs to perform natural language processing, code generation, reasoning, etc., users are writing code in natural language -- natural language code -- for the LLM to execute.
  An emerging area of research enables interoperability between natural language code and formal languages such as Python. We present a novel programming abstraction, shared program state, that removes the manual work required to enable interoperability between natural language code and program state. With shared program state, programmers can write natural code that directly writes program variables, computes with program objects, and implements control flow in the program. We present a schema for specifying natural function interfaces that extend programming systems to support natural code and leverage this schema to specify shared program state as a natural function interface.
  We implement shared program state in the Nightjar programming system. Nightjar enables programmers to write Python programs that contain natural code that shares the Python program state. We show that Nightjar programs achieve comparable or higher task accuracy than manually written implementations (+4-19%), while decreasing the lines of code by 39.6% on average. The tradeoff to using Nightjar is that it may incur runtime overhead (0.4-4.3x runtime of manual implementations).

Result: 评测发现即使前沿模型表现不佳，如Gemini 3 Pro Preview (Thinking)通过率为54.65%，模型在新维度上常失败，且Self Coherence随音频上下文变长而降低。

Conclusion: Audio MultiChallenge提供了可复现的测试平台，能量化模型短板并推动语音原生多轮交互能力的改进。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems are increasingly replacing cascaded pipelines for voice-based human-AI interaction, processing raw audio directly without intermediate transcription. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these models on synthetic speech and single-turn tasks, leaving realistic multi-turn conversational ability underexplored. We introduce Audio MultiChallenge, an open-source benchmark to evaluate E2E spoken dialogue systems under natural multi-turn interaction patterns. Building on the text-based MultiChallenge framework, which evaluates Inference Memory, Instruction Retention, and Self Coherence, we introduce a new axis Voice Editing that tests robustness to mid-utterance speech repairs and backtracking. We further augment each axis to the audio modality, such as introducing Audio-Cue challenges for Inference Memory that require recalling ambient sounds and paralinguistic signals beyond semantic content. We curate 452 conversations from 47 speakers with 1,712 instance-specific rubrics through a hybrid audio-native agentic and human-in-the-loop pipeline that exposes model failures at scale while preserving natural disfluencies found in unscripted human speech. Our evaluation of proprietary and open-source models reveals that even frontier models struggle on our benchmark, with Gemini 3 Pro Preview (Thinking), our highest-performing model achieving a 54.65% pass rate. Error analysis shows that models fail most often on our new axes and that Self Coherence degrades with longer audio context. These failures reflect difficulty of tracking edits, audio cues, and long-range context in natural spoken dialogue. Audio MultiChallenge provides a reproducible testbed to quantify them and drive improvements in audio-native multi-turn interaction capability.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation have increased the risk of realistic environmental sound manipulation, motivating the ESDD 2026 Challenge as the first large-scale benchmark for Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection (ESDD). We propose BEAT2AASIST which extends BEATs-AASIST by splitting BEATs-derived representations along frequency or channel dimension and processing them with dual AASIST branches. To enrich feature representations, we incorporate top-k transformer layer fusion using concatenation, CNN-gated, and SE-gated strategies. In addition, vocoder-based data augmentation is applied to improve robustness against unseen spoofing methods. Experimental results on the official test sets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance across the challenge tracks.

Conclusion: 该方法可仅使用输入 - 输出音频记录对时变音频效果进行建模，无需调制信号提取。

Abstract: Deep learning has become a standard approach for the modeling of audio effects, yet strictly black-box modeling remains problematic for time-varying systems. Unlike time-invariant effects, training models on devices with internal modulation typically requires the recording or extraction of control signals to ensure the time-alignment required by standard loss functions. This paper introduces a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to model such effects using only input-output audio recordings, removing the need for modulation signal extraction. We propose a convolutional-recurrent architecture trained via a two-stage strategy: an initial adversarial phase allows the model to learn the distribution of the modulation behavior without strict phase constraints, followed by a supervised fine-tuning phase where a State Prediction Network (SPN) estimates the initial internal states required to synchronize the model with the target. Additionally, a new objective metric based on chirp-train signals is developed to quantify modulation accuracy. Experiments modeling a vintage hardware phaser demonstrate the method's ability to capture time-varying dynamics in a fully black-box context.

*Ken O'Hanlon,Basil Woods,Lin Wang,Mark Sandler*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出用于音乐源分离的条件式UNet QSCNet，其表现优于Banquet且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在需严格乐器词汇表的问题，且有研究称UNet不适用于条件式音乐源分离，要提出改进的条件式UNet方法。

Method: 提出QSCNet，将网络条件元素集成到用于音乐源分离的稀疏压缩网络中。

Result: QSCNet在几项音乐源分离任务上比Banquet的信噪比高出1dB以上，且使用参数不到其一半。

Conclusion: 证明了条件式UNet适用于音乐源分离，且QSCNet表现更优。

Abstract: In this paper we propose a conditioned UNet for Music Source Separation (MSS). MSS is generally performed by multi-output neural networks, typically UNets, with each output representing a particular stem from a predefined instrument vocabulary. In contrast, conditioned MSS networks accept an audio query related to a stem of interest alongside the signal from which that stem is to be extracted. Thus, a strict vocabulary is not required and this enables more realistic tasks in MSS. The potential of conditioned approaches for such tasks has been somewhat hidden due to a lack of suitable data, an issue recently addressed with the MoisesDb dataset. A recent method, Banquet, employs this dataset with promising results seen on larger vocabularies. Banquet uses Bandsplit RNN rather than a UNet and the authors state that UNets should not be suitable for conditioned MSS. We counter this argument and propose QSCNet, a novel conditioned UNet for MSS that integrates network conditioning elements in the Sparse Compressed Network for MSS. We find QSCNet to outperform Banquet by over 1dB SNR on a couple of MSS tasks, while using less than half the number of parameters.

Conclusion: 所提算法能有效解决从噪声成对比较中排序对象的问题，贝叶斯方法结论较稳健。

Abstract: We consider the problem of ranking objects from noisy pairwise comparisons, for example, ranking tennis players from the outcomes of matches. We follow a standard approach to this problem and assume that each object has an unobserved strength and that the outcome of each comparison depends probabilistically on the strengths of the comparands. However, we do not assume to know a priori how skills affect outcomes. Instead, we present an efficient algorithm for simultaneously inferring both the unobserved strengths and the function that maps strengths to probabilities. Despite this problem being under-constrained, we present experimental evidence that the conclusions of our Bayesian approach are robust to different model specifications. We include several case studies to exemplify the method on real-world data sets.

Abstract: The advent of online social networks has facilitated fast and wide spread of information. However, some users, especially members of minority groups, may be less likely to receive information spreading on the network, due to their disadvantaged network position. We study the optimization problem of adding new connections to a network to enhance fairness in information access among different demographic groups.
  We provide a concrete formulation of this problem where information access is measured in terms of resistance distance, {offering a new perspective that emphasizes global network structure and multi-path connectivity.} The problem is shown to be NP-hard. We propose a simple greedy algorithm which turns out to output accurate solutions, but its run time is cubic, which makes it undesirable for large networks. As our main technical contribution, we reduce its time complexity to linear, leveraging several novel approximation techniques. In addition to our theoretical findings, we also conduct an extensive set of experiments using both real-world and synthetic datasets. We demonstrate that our linear-time algorithm can produce accurate solutions for networks with millions of nodes.

Abstract: Intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities and gained increasing popularity on social media platforms. While LLM agents are reshaping the ecology of social media, there exists a current gap in conducting a comprehensive evaluation of their ability to comprehend media content, understand user behaviors, and make intricate decisions. To address this challenge, we introduce SoMe, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate social media agents equipped with various agent tools for accessing and analyzing social media data. SoMe comprises a diverse collection of 8 social media agent tasks, 9,164,284 posts, 6,591 user profiles, and 25,686 reports from various social media platforms and external websites, with 17,869 meticulously annotated task queries. Compared with the existing datasets and benchmarks for social media tasks, SoMe is the first to provide a versatile and realistic platform for LLM-based social media agents to handle diverse social media tasks. By extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we provide the first overview insight into the performance of mainstream agentic LLMs in realistic social media environments and identify several limitations. Our evaluation reveals that both the current closed-source and open-source LLMs cannot handle social media agent tasks satisfactorily. SoMe provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future social media agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/LivXue/SoMe

Abstract: Recommendation systems face challenges in dynamically adapting to evolving user preferences and interactions within complex social networks. Traditional approaches often fail to account for the intricate interactions within cyber-social systems and lack the flexibility to generalize across diverse domains, highlighting the need for more adaptive and versatile solutions. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose swarm intelligence algorithm for recommendation systems, designed to adapt seamlessly to varying applications. It was inspired by social psychology principles. The framework models user preferences and community influences within a dynamic hypergraph structure. It leverages centrality-based feature extraction and Node2Vec embeddings. Preference evolution is guided by message-passing mechanisms and hierarchical graph modeling, enabling real-time adaptation to changing behaviors. Experimental evaluations demonstrated the algorithm's superior performance in various recommendation tasks, including social networks and content discovery. Key metrics such as Hit Rate (HR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) consistently outperformed baseline methods across multiple datasets. The model's adaptability to dynamic environments allowed for contextually relevant and precise recommendations. The proposed algorithm represents an advancement in recommendation systems by bridging individual preferences and community influences. Its general-purpose design enables applications in diverse domains, including social graphs, personalized learning, and medical graphs. This work highlights the potential of integrating swarm intelligence with network dynamics to address complex optimization challenges in recommendation systems.

Conclusion: 所提出的非线性演化框架能有效用于加权经济网络生存动态建模，且枢纽主导对网络稳定性有显著影响。

Abstract: This paper develops a nonlinear evolution framework for modelling survival dynamics on weighted economic networks by coupling a graph-based $p$-Laplacian diffusion operator with a stochastic structural drift. The resulting finite-dimensional PDE--SDE system captures how node-level survival reacts to nonlinear diffusion pressures while an aggregate complexity factor evolves according to an Itô{} process. Using accretive operator theory, nonlinear semigroup methods, and stochastic analysis, we establish existence and uniqueness of mild solutions, derive topology-dependent energy dissipation inequalities, and characterise the stability threshold separating dissipative, critical, amplifying, and explosive regimes. Numerical experiments on Barabási--Albert networks confirm that hub dominance magnifies nonlinear gradients and compresses stability margins, producing heavy-tailed survival distributions and occasional explosive behaviour.

Abstract: The problem that we would like to solve in this paper is to compute the edge p-Laplacian centrality for the air traffic network. In this problem, instead of computing the edge p-Laplacian centrality directly which is the very hard problem, we convert the air traffic network to the line graph. Finally, we will compute the node p-Laplacian centrality of the line graph which is equivalent to the edge p-Laplacian of the air traffic network. In this paper, the novel un-normalized graph (p-) Laplacian based ranking method will be developed based on the un-normalized graph p-Laplacian operator definitions such as the curvature operator of graph (i.e. the un-normalized graph 1-Laplacian operator) and will be used to compute the node p-Laplacian centrality of the line graph. The results from the experiments show that the un-normalized graph p-Laplacian ranking methods can be implemented successfully.

Conclusion: 弥合传统控制系统设计与现代以用户为中心设计方法的差距，可使加速器HSI更易用、易维护且有效。

Abstract: Accelerator control systems often represent relatively complex and safety-sensitive human-machine interfaces within process control industries. These systems are technically robust and reflect the cumulative integration of solutions built and adapted across decades. One of the regular, unfortunate casualties of provisional accelerator control system updates is their human-system interfaces (HSIs) which often lag behind modern usability and design standards. An additional challenge is that although there is a multitude of established human factors (HF), and user experience (UX) principles for everyday digital applications, there are very few (if any) established principles for complex and safety-critical applications for an accelerator. This paper argues for the importance of established HF and UX principles (herein referred to as human-centered design principles) into the development of accelerator HSIs, emphasizing the need for clarity, consistency, responsiveness, and cognitive accessibility. Drawing from HF/UX best practices and human-centered design, this paper discusses how these approaches can enhance operator performance, reduce human error, and improve accelerator personnel collaboration. Case studies from Accelerator Control Operations Research Network (ACORN) at Fermilab are explored to demonstrate how interfaces built with human-centered design principles can scale with system complexity while remaining intuitive and efficient for diverse user roles including operators, machine experts, and engineers. By bridging the gap between traditional control system design and modern human-centered design methods, this paper provides a roadmap for evolving accelerator HSIs into more usable, maintainable, and effective tools.

Abstract: The development of nuclear fusion requires materials that can withstand extreme conditions. The IFMIF-DONES facility, a high-power particle accelerator, is being designed to qualify these materials. A critical testbed for its development is the MuVacAS prototype, which replicates the final segment of the accelerator beamline. Precise regulation of argon gas pressure within its ultra-high vacuum chamber is vital for this task. This work presents a fully data-driven approach for autonomous pressure control. A Deep Learning Surrogate Model, trained on real operational data, emulates the dynamics of the argon injection system. This high-fidelity digital twin then serves as a fast-simulation environment to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent. The results demonstrate that the agent successfully learns a control policy that maintains gas pressure within strict operational limits despite dynamic disturbances. This approach marks a significant step toward the intelligent, autonomous control systems required for the demanding next-generation particle accelerator facilities.

Result: 所提方法不依赖底层PDE、计算域几何和边界条件性质，且只需最小化超参数调整。

Conclusion: 该工作推动PINNs成为能与有限元法竞争的成熟数值方法。

Abstract: Since their advent nearly a decade ago, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been studied extensively as a novel technique for solving forward and inverse problems in physics and engineering. The neural network discretization of the solution field is naturally adaptive and avoids meshing the computational domain, which can both improve the accuracy of the numerical solution and streamline implementation. However, there have been limited studies of PINNs on complex three-dimensional geometries, as the lack of mesh and the reliance on the strong form of the partial differential equation (PDE) make boundary condition (BC) enforcement challenging. Techniques to enforce BCs with PINNs have proliferated in the literature, but a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of these techniques and a study of their efficacy on geometrically complex three-dimensional test problems are lacking. In this work, we i) systematically compare BC enforcement techniques for PINNs, ii) propose a general solution framework for arbitrary three-dimensional geometries, and iii) verify the methodology on three-dimensional, linear and nonlinear test problems with combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundaries. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying PDE, the geometry of the computational domain, and the nature of the BCs, while requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning. This work represents a step in the direction of establishing PINNs as a mature numerical method, capable of competing head-to-head with incumbents such as the finite element method.

Conclusion: 所提的两级多智能体HDRL框架及算法可有效解决SAGIN中无人机移动管理问题，且具有可扩展性和更好性能。

Abstract: Due to the significant variations in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) altitude and horizontal mobility, it becomes difficult for any single network to ensure continuous and reliable threedimensional coverage. Towards that end, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as an essential architecture for enabling ubiquitous UAV connectivity. To address the pronounced disparities in coverage and signal characteristics across heterogeneous networks, this paper formulates UAV mobility management in SAGIN as a constrained multi-objective joint optimization problem. The formulation couples discrete link selection with continuous trajectory optimization. Building on this, we propose a two-level multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework that decomposes the problem into two alternately solvable subproblems. To map complex link selection decisions into a compact discrete action space, we conceive a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm in the top-level, which achieves stable and high-quality policy learning through double Q-value estimation. To handle the continuous trajectory action space while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints, we integrate the maximum-entropy mechanism of the soft actor-critic (SAC) and employ a Lagrangian-based constrained SAC (CSAC) algorithm in the lower-level that dynamically adjusts the Lagrange multipliers to balance constraint satisfaction and policy optimization. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended to multi-UAV scenarios under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, which enables more generalizable policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency and QoS satisfaction.

Conclusion: 传统儿童睡眠问卷评分有局限，基于概率亚组的方法有助于理解儿童睡眠困难。

Abstract: Sleep difficulties in children are heterogeneous in presentation, yet conventional assessment tools like the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) reduce this complexity to a single cumulative score, obscuring distinct patterns of sleep disturbance that require different interventions. Latent Class Regression (LCR) models offer a principled approach to identify subgroups with shared sleep behaviour profiles whilst incorporating predictors of group membership, but Bayesian inference for these models has been hindered by computational challenges and the absence of variable selection methods. We propose a fully Bayesian framework for LCR that uses Pólya-Gamma data augmentation, enabling efficient sampling of regression coefficients. We extend this framework to include variable selection for both predictors and item responses: predictor variable selection via latent inclusion indicators and item selection through a partially collapsed approach. Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed methods yield accurate parameter estimates, resolve identifiability issues arising in full models and successfully identify informative predictors and items while excluding noise variables. Applying this methodology to CSHQ data from 148 children reveals distinct latent subgroups with different sleep behaviour profiles, anxious nighttime sleepers, short/light sleepers and those with more pervasive sleep problems, with each carrying distinct implications for intervention. Results also highlight the predictive role of Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis in subgroup membership. These findings demonstrate the limitations of conventional CSHQ scoring and illustrate the benefits of a probabilistic subgroup-based approach as an alternative for understanding paediatric sleep difficulties.

Conclusion: SBT技术可用于调查分析、项目响应评估和人工智能系统公平性审计等应用。

Abstract: The Stratified Bootstrap Test (SBT) provides a nonparametric, resampling-based framework for assessing the stability of group-specific ranking patterns in multivariate survey or rating data. By repeatedly resampling observations and examining whether a group's top-ranked items remain among the highest-scoring categories across bootstrap samples, SBT quantifies ranking robustness through a non-containment index. In parallel, the stratified bootstrap test extends this framework to formal statistical inference by testing ordering hypotheses among population means. Through resampling within groups, the method approximates the null distribution of ranking-based test statistics without relying on distributional assumptions. Together, these techniques enable both descriptive and inferential evaluation of ranking consistency, detection of aberrant or adversarial response patterns, and rigorous comparison of groups in applications such as survey analysis, item response assessment, and fairness auditing in AI systems.

Abstract: We propose a conformal prediction method for constructing tight simultaneous prediction intervals for multiple, potentially related, numerical outputs given a single input. This method can be combined with any multi-target regression model and guarantees finite-sample coverage. It is computationally efficient and yields informative prediction intervals even with limited data. The core idea is a novel \emph{coordinate-wise} standardization procedure that makes residuals across output dimensions directly comparable, estimating suitable scaling parameters using the calibration data themselves. This does not require modeling of cross-output dependence nor auxiliary sample splitting. Implementing this idea requires overcoming technical challenges associated with transductive or full conformal prediction. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate this method can produce tighter prediction intervals than existing baselines while maintaining valid simultaneous coverage.

Abstract: In this work, inspired by machine learning techniques, we propose a new Bayesian model for Small Area Estimation (SAE), the Fay-Herriot model with Spectral Clustering (FH-SC). Unlike traditional approaches, clustering in FH-SC is based on spectral clustering algorithms that utilize external covariates, rather than geographical or administrative criteria. A major advantage of the FH-SC model is its flexibility in integrating existing SAE approaches, with or without clustering random effects. To enable benchmarking, we leverage the theoretical framework of posterior projections for constrained Bayesian inference and derive closed form expressions for the new Rao-Blackwell (RB) estimators of the posterior mean under the FH-SC model. Additionally, we introduce a novel measure of uncertainty for the benchmarked estimator, the Conditional Posterior Mean Square Error (CPMSE), which is generalizable to other Bayesian SAE estimators. We conduct model-based and data-based simulation studies to evaluate the frequentist properties of the CPMSE. The proposed methodology is motivated by a real case study involving the estimation of the proportion of households with internet access in the municipalities of Colombia. Finally, we also illustrate the advantages of FH-SC over existing Bayesian and frequentist approaches through our case study.

Abstract: Modern operational systems ranging from logistics and cloud infrastructure to industrial IoT, are governed by complex, interdependent processes. Understanding how interventions propagate through such systems requires causal inference methods that go beyond direct effects to quantify mediated pathways. Traditional mediation analysis, while effective in simple settings, fails to scale to the high-dimensional directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) encountered in practice, particularly when multiple treatments and mediators interact. In this paper, we propose a scalable mediation analysis framework tailored for large causal DAGs involving multiple treatments and mediators. Our approach systematically decomposes total effects into interpretable direct and indirect components. We demonstrate its practical utility through applied case studies in fulfillment center logistics, where complex dependencies and non-controllable factors often obscure root causes.

Abstract: The innovative agriculture system is revolutionizing how we farm, making it one of the most critical innovations of our time! Yet it faces significant connectivity challenges, particularly with the sensors that power this technology. An efficient sensor deployment solution is still required to maximize the network's detection capabilities and efficiency while minimizing resource consumption and operational costs. This paper introduces an innovative sensor allocation optimization method that employs a Gradient-Based Iteration with Lagrange. The proposed method enhances coverage by utilizing a hybrid approach while minimizing the number of sensor nodes required under grid-based allocation. The proposed sensor distribution outperformed the classic deterministic deployment across coverage, number of sensors, cost, and power consumption. Furthermore, scalability is enhanced by extending sensing coverage to the remaining area via Bluetooth, which has a shorter communication range. Moreover, the proposed algorithm achieved 98.5% wireless sensor coverage, compared with 95% for the particle swarm distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前基于静态世界假设的3D场景图构建方法在处理现实场景中可交互障碍物时存在局限性，影响有效性。

Method: 提出HERO框架，将可操作障碍物建模为路径，捕捉其物理交互性、功能语义和场景关系层次来重新定义可通行性。

Result: 与基线相比，HERO在部分受阻环境中使PL降低35.1%，在完全受阻环境中使SR提高79.4%。

Conclusion: HERO框架具有更高效率和可达性，能改善现有方法的不足。

Abstract: 3D Scene Graphs (3DSGs) constitute a powerful representation of the physical world, distinguished by their abilities to explicitly model the complex spatial, semantic, and functional relationships between entities, rendering a foundational understanding that enables agents to interact intelligently with their environment and execute versatile behaviors. Embodied navigation, as a crucial component of such capabilities, leverages the compact and expressive nature of 3DSGs to enable long-horizon reasoning and planning in complex, large-scale environments. However, prior works rely on a static-world assumption, defining traversable space solely based on static spatial layouts and thereby treating interactable obstacles as non-traversable. This fundamental limitation severely undermines their effectiveness in real-world scenarios, leading to limited reachability, low efficiency, and inferior extensibility. To address these issues, we propose HERO, a novel framework for constructing Hierarchical Traversable 3DSGs, that redefines traversability by modeling operable obstacles as pathways, capturing their physical interactivity, functional semantics, and the scene's relational hierarchy. The results show that, relative to its baseline, HERO reduces PL by 35.1% in partially obstructed environments and increases SR by 79.4% in fully obstructed ones, demonstrating substantially higher efficiency and reachability.

Abstract: This paper proposes VLA-AN, an efficient and onboard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework dedicated to autonomous drone navigation in complex environments. VLA-AN addresses four major limitations of existing large aerial navigation models: the data domain gap, insufficient temporal navigation with reasoning, safety issues with generative action policies, and onboard deployment constraints. First, we construct a high-fidelity dataset utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to effectively bridge the domain gap. Second, we introduce a progressive three-stage training framework that sequentially reinforces scene comprehension, core flight skills, and complex navigation capabilities. Third, we design a lightweight, real-time action module coupled with geometric safety correction. This module ensures fast, collision-free, and stable command generation, mitigating the safety risks inherent in stochastic generative policies. Finally, through deep optimization of the onboard deployment pipeline, VLA-AN achieves a robust real-time 8.3x improvement in inference throughput on resource-constrained UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLA-AN significantly improves spatial grounding, scene reasoning, and long-horizon navigation, achieving a maximum single-task success rate of 98.1%, and providing an efficient, practical solution for realizing full-chain closed-loop autonomy in lightweight aerial robots.

Conclusion: 此研究为非侵入式地验证物理策略来源提供首种方法，是保护机器人知识产权的必要一步。

Abstract: The success of machine learning for real-world robotic systems has created a new form of intellectual property: the trained policy. This raises a critical need for novel methods that verify ownership and detect unauthorized, possibly unsafe misuse. While watermarking is established in other domains, physical policies present a unique challenge: remote detection. Existing methods assume access to the robot's internal state, but auditors are often limited to external observations (e.g., video footage). This ``Physical Observation Gap'' means the watermark must be detected from signals that are noisy, asynchronous, and filtered by unknown system dynamics. We formalize this challenge using the concept of a \textit{glimpse sequence}, and introduce Colored Noise Coherency (CoNoCo), the first watermarking strategy designed for remote detection. CoNoCo embeds a spectral signal into the robot's motions by leveraging the policy's inherent stochasticity. To show it does not degrade performance, we prove CoNoCo preserves the marginal action distribution. Our experiments demonstrate strong, robust detection across various remote modalities, including motion capture and side-way/top-down video footage, in both simulated and real-world robot experiments. This work provides a necessary step toward protecting intellectual property in robotics, offering the first method for validating the provenance of physical policies non-invasively, using purely remote observations.

Result: 在模拟和真实世界机器人操作任务中达到了最先进的性能，样本效率提高 10 倍，收敛速度提高 2 倍。

Conclusion: 利用视频在预训练中联合捕捉语义和视觉动态是更有效的范式。

Abstract: Prevailing Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) for robotic manipulation are built upon vision-language backbones pretrained on large-scale, but disconnected static web data. As a result, despite improved semantic generalization, the policy must implicitly infer complex physical dynamics and temporal dependencies solely from robot trajectories. This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce \model, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations. The decoder serves as an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM), generating low-level robot actions from the latent representation of video-space action plans. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, improving sample efficiency by 10x and convergence speed by 2x compared to traditional VLA architectures.

Conclusion: 该方法为将动力学参数依赖性扩展到其他环境和电化学变量奠定基础，支持更准确和可解释的热失控预测和监测。

Abstract: Thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries is strongly influenced by the state of charge (SOC). Existing predictive models typically infer scalar kinetic parameters at a full SOC or a few discrete SOC levels, preventing them from capturing the continuous SOC dependence that governs exothermic behavior during abuse conditions. To address this, we apply the Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Network (KA-CRNN) framework to learn continuous and realistic SOC-dependent exothermic cathode-electrolyte interactions. We apply a physics-encoded KA-CRNN to learn SOC-dependent kinetic parameters for cathode-electrolyte decomposition directly from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. A mechanistically informed reaction pathway is embedded into the network architecture, enabling the activation energies, pre-exponential factors, enthalpies, and related parameters to be represented as continuous and fully interpretable functions of the SOC. The framework is demonstrated for NCA, NM, and NMA cathodes, yielding models that reproduce DSC heat-release features across all SOCs and provide interpretable insight into SOC-dependent oxygen-release and phase-transformation mechanisms. This approach establishes a foundation for extending kinetic parameter dependencies to additional environmental and electrochemical variables, supporting more accurate and interpretable thermal-runaway prediction and monitoring.

Abstract: Photonics can offer a hardware-native route for machine learning (ML). However, efficient deployment of photonics-enhanced ML requires hybrid workflows that integrate optical processing with conventional CPU/GPU based neural network architectures. Here, we propose such a workflow that combines photonic positional embeddings (PEs) with advanced graph ML models. We introduce a photonics-based method that augments graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with PEs derived from light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices whose couplings match the input graph. We simulate propagation and readout to obtain internode intensity correlation matrices, which are used as PEs in GCNs to provide global structural information. Evaluated on Long Range Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, the method outperforms baseline GCNs with Laplacian based PEs, achieving $6.3\%$ lower mean absolute error for regression and $2.3\%$ higher average precision for classification tasks using a two-layer GCN as a baseline. When implemented in high repetition rate photonic hardware, correlation measurements can enable fast feature generation by bypassing digital simulation of PEs. Our results show that photonic PEs improve GCN performance and support optical acceleration of graph ML.

Conclusion: 该工作是消除科学相关系统中MEP发现计算障碍的有前景的一步，可大幅缩短计算时间且精度损失小。

Abstract: The discovery of a minimum energy pathway (MEP) between metastable states is crucial for scientific tasks including catalyst and biomolecular design. However, the standard nudged elastic band (NEB) algorithm requires hundreds to tens of thousands of compute-intensive simulations, making applications to complex systems prohibitively expensive. We introduce Neural Network Bayesian Algorithm Execution (NN-BAX), a framework that jointly learns the energy landscape and the MEP. NN-BAX sequentially fine-tunes a foundation model by actively selecting samples targeted at improving the MEP. Tested on Lennard-Jones and Embedded Atom Method systems, our approach achieves a one to two order of magnitude reduction in energy and force evaluations with negligible loss in MEP accuracy and demonstrates scalability to >100-dimensional systems. This work is therefore a promising step towards removing the computational barrier for MEP discovery in scientifically relevant systems, suggesting that weeks-long calculations may be achieved in hours or days with minimal loss in accuracy.

Conclusion: 使用统一嵌入空间进行可扩展、对放大倍数鲁棒的WSI分析是可行的。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) contain tissue information distributed across multiple magnification levels, yet most self-supervised methods treat these scales as independent views. This separation prevents models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes, a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows. This study introduces Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD), a self-supervised strategy that links low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail, enabling the model to learn how coarse tissue structure relates to fine cellular patterns. The resulting foundation model, MAD-NP, is trained entirely through this cross-scale correspondence without annotations. A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning. Segmentation outputs remain consistent across magnifications, preserving anatomical boundaries and minimizing noise. These results highlight the feasibility of scalable, magnification-robust WSI analysis using a unified embedding space

Abstract: Advanced Ovarian Cancer (AOC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage with peritoneal carcinosis (PC). Fagotti score (FS) assessment at diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) guides treatment planning by estimating surgical resectability, but its subjective and operator-dependent nature limits reproducibility and widespread use. Videos of patients undergoing DL with concomitant FS assessments at a referral center were retrospectively collected and divided into a development dataset, for data annotation, AI training and evaluation, and an independent test dataset, for internal validation. In the development dataset, FS-relevant frames were manually annotated for anatomical structures and PC. Deep learning models were trained to automatically identify FS-relevant frames, segment structures and PC, and predict video-level FS and indication to surgery (ItS). AI performance was evaluated using Dice score for segmentation, F1-scores for anatomical stations (AS) and ItS prediction, and root mean square error (RMSE) for final FS estimation. In the development dataset, the segmentation model trained on 7,311 frames, achieved Dice scores of 70$\pm$3% for anatomical structures and 56$\pm$3% for PC. Video-level AS classification achieved F1-scores of 74$\pm$3% and 73$\pm$4%, FS prediction showed normalized RMSE values of 1.39$\pm$0.18 and 1.15$\pm$0.08, and ItS reached F1-scores of 80$\pm$8% and 80$\pm$2% in the development (n=101) and independent test datasets (n=50), respectively. This is the first AI model to predict the feasibility of cytoreductive surgery providing automated FS estimation from DL videos. Its reproducible and reliable performance across datasets suggests that AI can support surgeons through standardized intraoperative tumor burden assessment and clinical decision-making in AOC.

Abstract: This study develops meta-learners for few-shot weakly-supervised segmentation (FWS) to address the challenge of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation for glaucoma diagnosis with limited labeled fundus images. We significantly improve existing meta-learners by introducing Omni meta-training which balances data usage and diversifies the number of shots. We also develop their efficient versions that reduce computational costs. In addition, we develop sparsification techniques that generate more customizable and representative scribbles and other sparse labels. After evaluating multiple datasets, we find that Omni and efficient versions outperform the original versions, with the best meta-learner being Efficient Omni ProtoSeg (EO-ProtoSeg). It achieves intersection over union (IoU) scores of 88.15% for OD and 71.17% for OC on the REFUGE dataset using just one sparsely labeled image, outperforming few-shot and semi-supervised methods which require more labeled images. Its best performance reaches 86.80% for OD and 71.78%for OC on DRISHTIGS, 88.21% for OD and 73.70% for OC on REFUGE, 80.39% for OD and 52.65% for OC on REFUGE. EO-ProtoSeg is comparable to unsupervised domain adaptation methods yet much lighter with less than two million parameters and does not require any retraining.

TL;DR: 本文开发端到端深度学习管道，用7T ECCENTRIC wu - MRSI实现人脑代谢、QSM和MWF同步高质量成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: wu - MRSI大的水边带给代谢拟合带来挑战，需开发方法克服。

Method: 7T下用非笛卡尔ECCENTRIC采样和超短回波时间获取wu - MRSI，用WALINET +去除脂质、水信号和边带，用DeepER和物理信息网络进行MRSI重建和代谢物拟合，用水信号进行绝对代谢物定量、QSM和MWF成像。

Result: WALINET +在模拟和体内表现良好，wu - MRSI中部分代谢物SNR更高，wu - MRSI得到的QSM和MWF与GRE结果一致性好。

Conclusion: 7T ECCENTRIC wu - MRSI可在12分钟内以2mm各向同性分辨率同时实现高质量代谢、QSM和MWF成像，WALINET +能有效去除水边带。

Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) maps endogenous brain metabolism while suppressing the overwhelming water signal. Water-unsuppressed MRSI (wu-MRSI) allows simultaneous imaging of water and metabolites, but large water sidebands cause challenges for metabolic fitting. We developed an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline to overcome these challenges at ultra-high field. Methods:Fast high-resolution wu-MRSI was acquired at 7T with non-cartesian ECCENTRIC sampling and ultra-short echo time. A water and lipid removal network (WALINET+) was developed to remove lipids, water signal, and sidebands. MRSI reconstruction was performed by DeepER and a physics-informed network for metabolite fitting. Water signal was used for absolute metabolite quantification, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and myelin water fraction imaging (MWF). Results: WALINET+ provided the lowest NRMSE (< 2%) in simulations and in vivo the smallest bias (< 20%) and limits-of-agreement (+-63%) between wu-MRSI and ws-MRSI scans. Several metabolites such as creatine and glutamate showed higher SNR in wu-MRSI. QSM and MWF obtained from wu-MRSI and GRE showed good agreement with 0 ppm/5.5% bias and +-0.05 ppm/ +- 12.75% limits-of-agreement. Conclusion: High-quality metabolic, QSM, and MWF mapping of the human brain can be obtained simultaneously by ECCENTRIC wu-MRSI at 7T with 2 mm isotropic resolution in 12 min. WALINET+ robustly removes water sidebands while preserving metabolite signal, eliminating the need for water suppression and separate water acquisitions.

### [202] [I am here for you": How relational conversational AI appeals to adolescents, especially those who are socially and emotionally vulnerable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15117)
*Pilyoung Kim,Yun Xie,Sujin Yang*

TL;DR: 研究青少年和家长对聊天机器人对话风格偏好，发现青少年更喜关系型，该风格增强拟人化等，对脆弱青少年有吸引力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨对话风格如何影响青少年对聊天机器人的拟人化和情感依赖。

Method: 对284对青少年 - 家长进行线上实验，让他们阅读两种风格聊天机器人对话记录。

Result: 青少年更偏好关系型风格，父母更偏好透明风格；关系型被青少年认为更像人、更可爱等；偏好关系型的青少年社交和情绪状况较差。

Conclusion: 对话风格是青少年AI安全设计关键，关系型对脆弱青少年有吸引力，可能增加情感依赖风险。

Abstract: General-purpose conversational AI chatbots and AI companions increasingly provide young adolescents with emotionally supportive conversations, raising questions about how conversational style shapes anthropomorphism and emotional reliance. In a preregistered online experiment with 284 adolescent-parent dyads, youth aged 11-15 and their parents read two matched transcripts in which a chatbot responded to an everyday social problem using either a relational style (first-person, affiliative, commitment language) or a transparent style (explicit nonhumanness, informational tone). Adolescents more often preferred the relational than the transparent style, whereas parents were more likely to prefer transparent style than adolescents. Adolescents rated the relational chatbot as more human-like, likable, trustworthy and emotionally close, while perceiving both styles as similarly helpful. Adolescents who preferred relational style had lower family and peer relationship quality and higher stress and anxiety than those preferring transparent style or both chatbots. These findings identify conversational style as a key design lever for youth AI safety, showing that relational framing heightens anthropomorphism, trust and emotional closeness and can be especially appealing to socially and emotionally vulnerable adolescents, who may be at increased risk for emotional reliance on conversational AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在高模糊性条件下易过早解读闭合，管理科学存在如何让人机系统负责任地处理模糊性的差距。

Method: 提出LAIZA系统及其专利流程，将模糊性操作化为非坍塌认知状态，检测异常变量，在自主推理不可靠时激活人工澄清；进行三个月案例研究。

Result: 保留解释多样性能实现基于情景的早期准备，如主动专利保护，在模糊性消除后可果断无干扰行动。

Conclusion: 将模糊性重新定义为一级结构，证明人机共生对组织在VUCA环境恢复力的实用价值。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly operate in environments characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), where early indicators of change often emerge as weak, fragmented signals. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used to support managerial decision-making, most AI-based systems remain optimized for prediction and resolution, leading to premature interpretive closure under conditions of high ambiguity. This creates a gap in management science regarding how human-AI systems can responsibly manage ambiguity before it crystallizes into error or crisis. This study addresses this gap by presenting a proof of concept (PoC) of the LAIZA human-AI augmented symbiotic intelligence system and its patented process: Systems and Methods for Quantum-Inspired Rogue Variable Modeling (QRVM), Human-in-the-Loop Decoherence, and Collective Cognitive Inference. The mechanism operationalizes ambiguity as a non-collapsed cognitive state, detects persistent interpretive breakdowns (rogue variables), and activates structured human-in-the-loop clarification when autonomous inference becomes unreliable. Empirically, the article draws on a three-month case study conducted in 2025 within the AI development, involving prolonged ambiguity surrounding employee intentions and intellectual property boundaries. The findings show that preserving interpretive plurality enabled early scenario-based preparation, including proactive patent protection, allowing decisive and disruption-free action once ambiguity collapsed. The study contributes to management theory by reframing ambiguity as a first-class construct and demonstrates the practical value of human-AI symbiosis for organizational resilience in VUCA environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI和LLM融入日常生活，XR社区想集成LLM，但会引发隐私问题，因此需以用户为中心理解技术接受度与担忧。

Method: 进行有1036名参与者的大规模众包研究，考察XR环境类型、语音交互类型和数据处理位置等因素下用户对LLM驱动对话代理的决策过程。

Result: 用户总体接受技术，但表达了多方面担忧；日常使用生成式AI与更高接受度相关，有XR设备所有权与较低接受度相关；男性接受度高于女性；位置数据引发最多担忧。

Conclusion: 强调从业者向用户有效沟通措施的重要性，给出了LLM驱动XR的影响与建议。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), and the availability of services that make them accessible, have led the general public to begin incorporating them into everyday life. The extended reality (XR) community has also sought to integrate LLMs, particularly in the form of conversational agents, to enhance user experience and task efficiency. When interacting with such conversational agents, users may easily disclose sensitive information due to the naturalistic flow of the conversations, and combining such conversational data with fine-grained sensor data may lead to novel privacy issues. To address these issues, a user-centric understanding of technology acceptance and concerns is essential. Therefore, to this end, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants, examining user decision-making processes regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in XR, across factors of XR setting type, speech interaction type, and data processing location. We found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express concerns related to security, privacy, social implications, and trust. Our results suggest that familiarity plays a crucial role, as daily generative AI use is associated with greater acceptance. In contrast, previous ownership of XR devices is linked to less acceptance, possibly due to existing familiarity with the settings. We also found that men report higher acceptance with fewer concerns than women. Regarding data type sensitivity, location data elicited the most significant concern, while body temperature and virtual object states were considered least sensitive. Overall, our study highlights the importance of practitioners effectively communicating their measures to users, who may remain distrustful. We conclude with implications and recommendations for LLM-powered XR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ccRCC存在广泛肿瘤内异质性，传统TNM分期效果有限，需多尺度整合分析框架，DCCD - ccRCC亚型预后差。

Method: 建立分层跨尺度框架，通过跨模态映射建立监督桥梁，设计模态特定模型，如PathoDCCD和RadioDCCD。

Result: 在五个共1659名患者的队列中，PathoDCCD可重现分子亚型，RadioDCCD可术前可靠预测，能识别临床预后最差患者。

Conclusion: 该跨尺度范式将多学科统一，为ccRCC术前非侵入性分子表型分析提供生物学策略。

Abstract: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) exhibits extensive intratumoral heterogeneity on multiple biological scales, contributing to variable clinical outcomes and limiting the effectiveness of conventional TNM staging, which highlights the urgent need for multiscale integrative analytic frameworks. The lipid-deficient de-clear cell differentiated (DCCD) ccRCC subtype, defined by multi-omics analyses, is associated with adverse outcomes even in early-stage disease. Here, we establish a hierarchical cross-scale framework for the preoperative identification of DCCD-ccRCC. At the highest layer, cross-modal mapping transferred molecular signatures to histological and CT phenotypes, establishing a molecular-to-pathology-to-radiology supervisory bridge. Within this framework, each modality-specific model is designed to mirror the inherent hierarchical structure of tumor biology. PathoDCCD captured multi-scale microscopic features, from cellular morphology and tissue architecture to meso-regional organization. RadioDCCD integrated complementary macroscopic information by combining whole-tumor and its habitat-subregions radiomics with a 2D maximal-section heterogeneity metric. These nested models enabled integrated molecular subtype prediction and clinical risk stratification. Across five cohorts totaling 1,659 patients, PathoDCCD reliably recapitulated molecular subtypes, while RadioDCCD provided reliable preoperative prediction. The consistent predictions identified patients with the poorest clinical outcomes. This cross-scale paradigm unifies molecular biology, computational pathology, and quantitative radiology into a biologically grounded strategy for preoperative noninvasive molecular phenotyping of ccRCC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化空间边界位置的不确定性和正式检验其随时间的变化具有挑战性，尤其是处理来自嘈杂网格环境数据的边界时，因此需要新的方法。

Method: 结合异方差高斯过程（GP）回归与标准化最大绝对差（MAD）全局包络检验（GET）来估计空间边界曲线并评估其随时间的演化。

Result: 模拟研究表明该方法在原假设下达到正确大小且检测局部边界变化的功效高；应用于萨赫勒 - 撒哈拉过渡区，未发现干旱 - 半干旱或半干旱 - 非干旱界面有显著的十年尺度变化，但成功识别出1983和1984年极端干旱年份的局部边界变化。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架是一种有效的估计和评估空间边界曲线随时间变化的方法。

Abstract: Spatial boundaries, such as ecological transitions or climatic regime interfaces, capture steep environmental gradients, and shifts in their structure can signal emerging environmental changes. Quantifying uncertainty in spatial boundary locations and formally testing for temporal shifts remains challenging, especially when boundaries are derived from noisy, gridded environmental data. We present a unified framework that combines heteroskedastic Gaussian process (GP) regression with a scaled Maximum Absolute Difference (MAD) Global Envelope Test (GET) to estimate spatial boundary curves and assess whether they evolve over time. The heteroskedastic GP provides a flexible probabilistic reconstruction of boundary lines, capturing spatially varying mean structure and location specific variability, while the test offers a rigorous hypothesis testing tool for detecting departures from expected boundary behaviors. Simulation studies show that the proposed method achieves the correct size under the null and high power for detecting local boundary shifts. Applying our framework to the Sahel Sahara transition zone, using annual Koppen Trewartha climate classifications from 1960 to 1989, we find no statistically significant decade scale changes in the arid and semi arid or semi arid and non arid interfaces. However, the method successfully identifies localized boundary shifts during the extreme drought years of 1983 and 1984, consistent with climate studies documenting regional anomalies in these interfaces during that period.

Method: 引入RMPMAB框架，将实验区域建模为马尔可夫链集合，推导聚合过程行为表达式，设计具次线性复杂度的Whittle索引策略。

Result: 通过模拟和真实数据集，该方法在资源约束下显著提高吞吐量，优于其他算法，减少累计遗憾，捕捉更多生物相关事件。

Conclusion: RMPMAB框架统一了随机决策理论和最优自主显微镜控制，为多学科科学发现提供有效途径。

Abstract: High-content screening microscopy generates large amounts of live-cell imaging data, yet its potential remains constrained by the inability to determine when and where to image most effectively. Optimally balancing acquisition time, computational capacity, and photobleaching budgets across thousands of dynamically evolving regions of interest remains an open challenge, further complicated by limited field-of-view adjustments and sensor sensitivity. Existing approaches either rely on static sampling or heuristics that neglect the dynamic evolution of biological processes, leading to inefficiencies and missed events. Here, we introduce the restless multi-process multi-armed bandit (RMPMAB), a new decision-theoretic framework in which each experimental region is modeled not as a single process but as an ensemble of Markov chains, thereby capturing the inherent heterogeneity of biological systems such as asynchronous cell cycles and heterogeneous drug responses. Building upon this foundation, we derive closed-form expressions for transient and asymptotic behaviors of aggregated processes, and design scalable Whittle index policies with sub-linear complexity in the number of imaging regions. Through both simulations and a real biological live-cell imaging dataset, we show that our approach achieves substantial improvements in throughput under resource constraints. Notably, our algorithm outperforms Thomson Sampling, Bayesian UCB, epsilon-Greedy, and Round Robin by reducing cumulative regret by more than 37% in simulations and capturing 93% more biologically relevant events in live imaging experiments, underscoring its potential for transformative smart microscopy. Beyond improving experimental efficiency, the RMPMAB framework unifies stochastic decision theory with optimal autonomous microscopy control, offering a principled approach to accelerate discovery across multidisciplinary sciences.

Abstract: AI-powered greenwashing has emerged as an insidious challenge within corporate sustainability governance, exacerbating the opacity of environmental disclosures and subverting regulatory oversight. This study conducts a comparative legal analysis of criminal liability for AI-mediated greenwashing across India, the US, and the EU, exposing doctrinal lacunae in attributing culpability when deceptive claims originate from algorithmic systems. Existing statutes exhibit anthropocentric biases by predicating liability on demonstrable human intent, rendering them ill-equipped to address algorithmic deception. The research identifies a critical gap in jurisprudential adaptation, as prevailing fraud statutes remain antiquated vis-à-vis AI-generated misrepresentation. Utilising a doctrinal legal methodology, this study systematically dissects judicial precedents and statutory instruments, yielding results regarding the potential expansion of corporate criminal liability. Findings underscore the viability of strict liability models, recalibrated governance frameworks for AI accountability, and algorithmic due diligence mandates under ESG regimes. Comparative insights reveal jurisdictional disparities, with the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) offering a potential transnational model. This study contributes to AI ethics and environmental jurisprudence by advocating for a hybrid liability framework integrating algorithmic risk assessment with legal personhood constructs, ensuring algorithmic opacity does not preclude liability enforcement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有外部评估与安全框架下，缺乏对前沿AI开发者内部组织保证结构的关注，需研究如何提供对灾难性和系统性风险的持续监督。

Method: 借鉴专业内部审计标准、基于风险的保证理论和前沿AI治理文献，分析审计范围、采购安排、审计频率和获取敏感信息这四个核心设计维度。

Result: 明确各维度的相关选项空间，评估优缺点，识别关键组织和安全权衡。

Conclusion: 为前沿AI情境精心设计的内部审计能在加强安全治理、补充外部评估、为董事会和监管机构提供对灾难性风险控制的信心方面发挥核心作用。

Abstract: Frontier AI developers operate at the intersection of rapid technical progress, extreme risk exposure, and growing regulatory scrutiny. While a range of external evaluations and safety frameworks have emerged, comparatively little attention has been paid to how internal organizational assurance should be structured to provide sustained, evidence-based oversight of catastrophic and systemic risks. This paper examines how an internal audit function could be designed to provide meaningful assurance for frontier AI developers, and the practical trade-offs that shape its effectiveness. Drawing on professional internal auditing standards, risk-based assurance theory, and emerging frontier-AI governance literature, we analyze four core design dimensions: (i) audit scope across model-level, system-level, and governance-level controls; (ii) sourcing arrangements (in-house, co-sourced, and outsourced); (iii) audit frequency and cadence; and (iv) access to sensitive information required for credible assurance. For each dimension, we define the relevant option space, assess benefits and limitations, and identify key organizational and security trade-offs. Our findings suggest that internal audit, if deliberately designed for the frontier AI context, can play a central role in strengthening safety governance, complementing external evaluations, and providing boards and regulators with higher-confidence, system-wide assurance over catastrophic risk controls.

Conclusion: 指出了理想的监管监督与监管跟上技术变革实际困难之间的紧张关系。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) present unique challenges for policymakers that seek to govern the technology. In this context, the Delphi method has become an established way to identify consensus and disagreement on emerging technological issues among experts in the field of futures studies and foresight. The aim of this article is twofold: first, it examines key tensions experts see in the development of AI governance in Europe, and second, it reflects on the Delphi method's capacity to inform anticipatory governance of emerging technologies like AI based on these insights. The analysis is based on the results of a two-round Policy Delphi study on the future of AI governance with European policymakers, researchers and NGOs, conducted in mid-2024. The Policy Delphi proved useful in revealing diverse perspectives on European AI governance, drawing out a consensus that future-proof AI regulation will likely depend more on practical implementation and enforcement of legislation than on its technical specifics or scope. Furthermore, the study identified a desirability-probability gap in AI governance: desirable policy directions, like greater citizen participation, were perceived as less probable and feasible. This highlights a tension between desirable regulatory oversight and the practical difficulty for regulation to keep up with technological change.

TL;DR: 提出KV缓存管理系统EVICPRESS，结合有损压缩和自适应淘汰策略，在多存储层管理KV缓存，提升缓存命中率和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作未联合优化KV缓存的淘汰和压缩决策，本文旨在最小化平均生成延迟且不降低质量。

Method: 提出统一效用函数量化压缩和淘汰对质量和延迟的影响，通过分析模块更新配置分数，用启发式方法重新排列缓存。

Result: 与基线方法相比，EVICPRESS在快速设备上实现更高的KV缓存命中率，在保持高质量的同时降低延迟。

Conclusion: 在12个数据集和5个模型上的评估表明，EVICPRESS在同等生成质量下，首词生成时间最多快2.19倍。

Abstract: Reusing KV cache is essential for high efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems. With more LLM users, the KV cache footprint can easily exceed GPU memory capacity, so prior work has proposed to either evict KV cache to lower-tier storage devices, or compress KV cache so that more KV cache can be fit in the fast memory. However, prior work misses an important opportunity: jointly optimizing the eviction and compression decisions across all KV caches to minimize average generation latency without hurting quality.
  We propose EVICPRESS, a KV-cache management system that applies lossy compression and adaptive eviction to KV cache across multiple storage tiers. Specifically, for each KV cache of a context, EVICPRESS considers the effect of compression and eviction of the KV cache on the average generation quality and delay across all contexts as a whole. To achieve this, EVICPRESS proposes a unified utility function that quantifies the effect of quality and delay of the lossy compression or eviction. To this end, EVICPRESS's profiling module periodically updates the utility function scores on all possible eviction-compression configurations for all contexts and places KV caches using a fast heuristic to rearrange KV caches on all storage tiers, with the goal of maximizing the utility function scores on each storage tier. Compared to the baselines that evict KV cache or compress KV cache, EVICPRESS achieves higher KV-cache hit rates on fast devices, i.e., lower delay, while preserving high generation quality by applying conservative compression to contexts that are sensitive to compression errors. Evaluation on 12 datasets and 5 models demonstrates that EVICPRESS achieves up to 2.19x faster time-to-first-token (TTFT) at equivalent generation quality.

Result: 开放与封闭模型推出后长期债券收益率反向变动，国债、公司债和通胀保值债券表现类似。

Conclusion: 债券收益率变动不仅与技术进步有关，还和许可等因素有关，市场可能预期开放性有重要经济影响。

Abstract: Market expectations about AI's economic impact may influence interest rates. Previous work has shown that US bond yields decline around the release of a sample of mostly proprietary AI models (Andrews and Farboodi 2025). I extend this analysis to include also open weight AI models that can be freely used and modified. I find long-term bond yields shift in opposite directions following the introduction of open versus closed models. Patterns are similar for treasuries, corporate bonds, and TIPS. This suggests that the movement of bond yields around AI models may be a function of not only technological advances but also factors such as licensing. The different movements suggest that markets may anticipate openness to have important economic implications.

Abstract: We analyze the problem of optimal reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio in a stochastic control setting. The debt-to-GDP dynamics are modeled through a stochastic differential equation in which fiscal policy simultaneously affects both debt accumulation and GDP growth. A key feature of the framework is the introduction of a cost functional that captures the disutility of fiscal surpluses and the perceived benefit of fiscal deficits, thus incorporating the macroeconomic trade-off between tighten and expansionary policies. By applying the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman approach, we provide explicit solutions in the case of linear GDP response to the fiscal policies. We rigorously analyze threshold-type fiscal strategies in the case of linear impact of the fiscal policy and provide closed-form solutions for the associated value function in relevant regimes. A sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying key model parameters, confirming the robustness of our theoretical findings. The application to debt reduction highlights how fiscal costs and benefits influence optimal interventions, offering valuable insights into sustainable public debt management under uncertainty.

Method: 利用瑞典和美国的长期收入序列，提出可捕捉特定模式的生命周期估计量。

Result: 提出的估计量在不同环境下表现良好，可用于研究近期队列，发现两国虽收入不平等加剧，但代际流动性大体稳定。

Conclusion: 所提生命周期估计量有效，两国代际流动性在收入不平等加剧情况下保持稳定。

Abstract: Lacking lifetime income data, most intergenerational mobility estimates are subject to lifecycle bias. Using long income series from Sweden and the US, we illustrate that standard correction methods struggle to account for one important property of income processes: children from affluent families experience faster income growth, even conditional on their own characteristics. We propose a lifecycle estimator that captures this pattern and performs well across different settings. We apply the estimator to study mobility trends, including for recent cohorts that could not be considered in prior work. Despite rising income inequality, intergenerational mobility remained largely stable in both countries.

TL;DR: 通过预注册实地实验，研究社交媒体创作者（SMC）对美国18 - 45岁人群政治态度和行为的影响，发现不同内容SMC有不同影响，且其影响力超传统方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治冷漠和对传统权威的怀疑常见，社交媒体创作者受关注，但他们是否影响政治态度和行为未知，因此开展研究。

Method: 2024年8 - 12月鼓励美国18 - 45岁人群关注5个进步派SMC，设置不同内容类别（PP、PA、NP），交叉随机分配关注奖励。

Result: 提高了指定SMC内容的消费，增加了总体社交媒体使用和政治知识；不同内容SMC使参与者产生不同政治倾向变化；影响超传统宣传和党派媒体。

Conclusion: SMC作为注意力经济中的意见领袖很重要，政治说服有基于信任和数量的机制。

Abstract: Political apathy and skepticism of traditional authorities are increasingly common, but social media creators (SMCs) capture the public's attention. Yet whether these seemingly-frivolous actors shape political attitudes and behaviors remains largely unknown. Our pre-registered field experiment encouraged Americans aged 18-45 to start following five progressive-minded SMCs on Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube between August and December 2024. We varied recommendations to follow SMCs producing predominantly-political (PP), predominantly-apolitical (PA), or entirely non-political (NP) content, and cross-randomized financial incentives to follow assigned SMCs. Beyond markedly increasing consumption of assigned SMCs' content, biweekly quiz-based incentives increased overall social media use by 10% and made participants more politically knowledgeable. These incentives to follow PP or PA SMCs led participants to adopt more liberal policy positions and grand narratives around election time, while PP SMCs more strongly shaped partisan evaluations and vote choice. PA SMCs were seen as more informative and trustworthy, generating larger effects per video concerning politics. Participants assigned to follow NP SMCs instead became more conservative, consistent with left-leaning participants using social media more when right-leaning content was ascendant. These effects exceed the impacts of traditional campaign outreach and partisan media, demonstrating the importance of SMCs as opinion leaders in the attention economy as well as trust- and volume-based mechanisms of political persuasion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解新闻来源在民主社会中塑造政治和社会话语的动态，评估媒体景观是否对公共辩论提供平衡公正的描述。

Method: 微调大语言模型进行观点分类，用来自维基数据的相关行为者的语义描述丰富声明表示。

Result: 两种机制独立使用可提高分类性能，集成使用效果最佳，使用能处理长输入的大语言模型时尤其如此。

Conclusion: 改进后的管道在处理新闻语料观点分类上有更好的效果。

Abstract: News sources play a central role in democratic societies by shaping political and social discourse through specific topics, viewpoints and voices. Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing whether the media landscape offers a balanced and fair account of public debate. In earlier work, we introduced a pipeline that, given a news corpus, i) uses a hybrid human-machine approach to identify the range of viewpoints expressed about a given topic, and ii) classifies relevant claims with respect to the identified viewpoints, defined as sets of semantically and ideologically congruent claims (e.g., positions arguing that immigration positively impacts the UK economy). In this paper, we improve this pipeline by i) fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for viewpoint classification and ii) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors drawn from Wikidata. We evaluate our approach against alternative solutions on a benchmark centred on the UK immigration debate. Results show that while both mechanisms independently improve classification performance, their integration yields the best results, particularly when using LLMs capable of processing long inputs.

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的DASH - DTS框架用于对话主题分割，发布VHF - Dial数据集，实验显示框架在多个数据集达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理如海事VHF对话这类面向任务的公共信道通信的对话主题分割时有局限。

Method: 提出DASH - DTS框架，包括通过对话握手识别检测主题转移、基于相似度引导的示例选择增强上下文、生成选择性正负样本；发布VHF - Dial数据集。

Result: 框架在VHF - Dial和标准基准上达到多个SOTA分割可信准确率。

Conclusion: DASH - DTS框架为操作对话的稳定监测和决策支持奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Dialogue Topic Segmentation (DTS) is crucial for understanding task-oriented public-channel communications, such as maritime VHF dialogues, which feature informal speech and implicit transitions. To address the limitations of traditional methods, we propose DASH-DTS, a novel LLM-based framework. Its core contributions are: (1) topic shift detection via dialogue handshake recognition; (2) contextual enhancement through similarity-guided example selection; and (3) the generation of selective positive and negative samples to improve model discrimination and robustness. Additionally, we release VHF-Dial, the first public dataset of real-world maritime VHF communications, to advance research in this domain. DASH-DTS provides interpretable reasoning and confidence scores for each segment. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves several sota segmentation trusted accuracy on both VHF-Dial and standard benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for stable monitoring and decision support in operational dialogues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使大语言模型从随机聊天界面转变为可靠软件组件，当前基于启发式的提示工程方法无法满足关键任务应用的确定性要求。

Method: 引入元提示协议，该协议核心是由生成器、审计器和优化器组成的对抗三位一体架构，将自然语言指令视为语义计算图中的可微变量。

Result: 用声明式编程范式（DSPy）和自动文本微分（TextGrad）证明了该方法的理论可行性。

Conclusion: 为概率计算时代的“可观测软件工程”奠定了基础。

Abstract: The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from stochastic chat interfaces to reliable software components necessitates a fundamental re-engineering of interaction paradigms. Current methodologies, predominantly heuristic-based "prompt engineering," fail to provide the deterministic guarantees required for mission-critical applications. We introduce the Meta-Prompting Protocol, a rigorous theoretical framework that formalizes the orchestration of LLMs as a programmable, self-optimizing system. Central to this protocol is the Adversarial Trinity, a tripartite topology comprising a Generator (P), an Auditor (A), and an Optimizer (O). By treating natural language instructions as differentiable variables within a semantic computation graph and utilizing textual critiques as gradients, this architecture mitigates hallucination and prevents model collapse. We demonstrate the theoretical viability of this approach using declarative programming paradigms (DSPy) and automatic textual differentiation (TextGrad), establishing a foundation for "Observable Software Engineering" in the era of probabilistic computing.

Motivation: 挑战OpenAI关于大语言模型幻觉源于评估激励失调的观点。

Method: 借鉴结构幻觉的先前研究，用许可预言机进行实证实验。

Result: 证明幻觉只能通过外部真理验证和弃权模块消除，许可预言机实现完美弃权精度。

Conclusion: 幻觉是生成式架构的结构属性，可靠AI需要区分语言流畅性和认知责任的混合系统。

Abstract: OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.
  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.
  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.
  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在药学执照问答任务上的表现，开发外部知识集成方法以提高其准确性。

Method: 用141道药学问题数据集对11个不同参数规模的大语言模型进行基准测试，测量其基线准确率；开发三步检索增强生成管道DrugRAG，从验证源检索结构化药物知识并增强模型提示。

Result: 基线准确率在46% - 92%之间，GPT - 5和o3得分最高；DrugRAG使所有测试模型的准确率提高7 - 21个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过DrugRAG集成外部结构化药物知识可显著提高大语言模型在药学任务上的准确性，为增强药学AI应用提供实用途径。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate large language model (LLM) performance on pharmacy licensure-style question-answering (QA) tasks and develop an external knowledge integration method to improve their accuracy.
  Methods: We benchmarked eleven existing LLMs with varying parameter sizes (8 billion to 70+ billion) using a 141-question pharmacy dataset. We measured baseline accuracy for each model without modification. We then developed a three-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, DrugRAG, that retrieves structured drug knowledge from validated sources and augments model prompts with evidence-based context. This pipeline operates externally to the models, requiring no changes to model architecture or parameters.
  Results: Baseline accuracy ranged from 46% to 92%, with GPT-5 (92%) and o3 (89%) achieving the highest scores. Models with fewer than 8 billion parameters scored below 50%. DrugRAG improved accuracy across all tested models, with gains ranging from 7 to 21 percentage points (e.g., Gemma 3 27B: 61% to 71%, Llama 3.1 8B: 46% to 67%) on the 141-item benchmark.
  Conclusion: We demonstrate that external structured drug knowledge integration through DrugRAG measurably improves LLM accuracy on pharmacy tasks without modifying the underlying models. This approach provides a practical pipeline for enhancing pharmacy-focused AI applications with evidence-based information.

Result: 模型在罗马尼亚语视觉问答及图像描述生成任务上能力提升，Qwen2 - VL - RoVQA得分最高，语法错误减少。

Conclusion: 微调后的模型在罗马尼亚语理解和流利度上有改进。

Abstract: Focusing on low-resource languages is an essential step toward democratizing generative AI. In this work, we contribute to reducing the multimodal NLP resource gap for Romanian. We translate the widely known Flickr30k dataset into Romanian and further extend it for visual question answering by leveraging open-source LLMs. We demonstrate the usefulness of our datasets by fine-tuning open-source VLMs on Romanian visual question answering. We select VLMs from three widely used model families: LLaMA 3.2, LLaVA 1.6, and Qwen2. For fine-tuning, we employ the parameter-efficient LoRA method. Our models show improved Romanian capabilities in visual QA, as well as on tasks they were not trained on, such as Romanian image description generation. The seven-billion-parameter Qwen2-VL-RoVQA obtains top scores on both tasks, with improvements of +6.05% and +2.61% in BERTScore F1 over its original version. Finally, the models show substantial reductions in grammatical errors compared to their original forms, indicating improvements not only in language understanding but also in Romanian fluency.

Conclusion: 当前多模态大模型在科学推理能力上有局限，需开发更强大可解释的多模态系统，该研究为特定领域多模态AI提供基准。

Abstract: Multimodal scientific reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in chemistry, where problem-solving relies on symbolic diagrams, molecular structures, and structured visual data. Here, we systematically evaluate 40 proprietary and open-source multimodal LLMs, including GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen2.5-VL, on a curated benchmark of Olympiad-style chemistry questions drawn from over two decades of U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO) exams. These questions require integrated visual and textual reasoning across diverse modalities. We find that many models struggle with modality fusion, where in some cases, removing the image even improves accuracy, indicating misalignment in vision-language integration. Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently enhances both accuracy and visual grounding, as demonstrated through ablation studies and occlusion-based interpretability. Our results reveal critical limitations in the scientific reasoning abilities of current MLLMs, providing actionable strategies for developing more robust and interpretable multimodal systems in chemistry. This work provides a timely benchmark for measuring progress in domain-specific multimodal AI and underscores the need for further advances at the intersection of artificial intelligence and scientific reasoning.

Method: 提出SGM，一种白盒神经元级多模态干预方法，通过专业加权软抑制选择性重新校准一组有毒专家神经元；建立MM - TOXIC - QA多模态毒性评估框架。

Result: 在开源多模态大语言模型实验中，SGM在标准和对抗条件下减轻了毒性，将有害率从48.2%降至2.5%，同时保留了流畅性和多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: SGM具有可扩展性，其组合防御SGM*可与现有去毒方法集成以获得更强的安全性能，为毒性可控的多模态生成提供了可解释、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Disclaimer: Samples in this paper may be harmful and cause discomfort.
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable multimodal generation but inherit toxic, biased, and NSFW signals from weakly curated pretraining corpora, causing safety risks, especially under adversarial triggers that late, opaque training-free detoxification methods struggle to handle. We propose SGM, a white-box neuron-level multimodal intervention that acts like safety glasses for toxic neurons: it selectively recalibrates a small set of toxic expert neurons via expertise-weighted soft suppression, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without any parameter updates. We establish MM-TOXIC-QA, a multimodal toxicity evaluation framework, and compare SGM with existing detoxification techniques. Experiments on open-source MLLMs show that SGM mitigates toxicity in standard and adversarial conditions, cutting harmful rates from 48.2\% to 2.5\% while preserving fluency and multimodal reasoning. SGM is extensible, and its combined defenses, denoted as SGM*, integrate with existing detoxification methods for stronger safety performance, providing an interpretable, low-cost solution for toxicity-controlled multimodal generation.

Result: 系统评估开源和闭源大语言模型，发现安全性能差异大，任务范围和服务器交互增加时漏洞升级。

Conclusion: 强调需要更强防御，MCP - SafetyBench可用于诊断和缓解实际MCP部署中的安全风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into agentic systems that reason, plan, and operate external tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a key enabler of this transition, offering a standardized interface for connecting LLMs with heterogeneous tools and services. Yet MCP's openness and multi-server workflows introduce new safety risks that existing benchmarks fail to capture, as they focus on isolated attacks or lack real-world coverage. We present MCP-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark built on real MCP servers that supports realistic multi-turn evaluation across five domains: browser automation, financial analysis, location navigation, repository management, and web search. It incorporates a unified taxonomy of 20 MCP attack types spanning server, host, and user sides, and includes tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and cross-server coordination under uncertainty. Using MCP-SafetyBench, we systematically evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, revealing large disparities in safety performance and escalating vulnerabilities as task horizons and server interactions grow. Our results highlight the urgent need for stronger defenses and establish MCP-SafetyBench as a foundation for diagnosing and mitigating safety risks in real-world MCP deployments.

Motivation: 在知识蒸馏等训练范式中，当师生语言模型使用不同分词器时，计算下一个标记似然比变得具有挑战性，需要解决词汇表不对齐问题。

Method: 揭示常用字节对编码（BPE）算法中的隐式递归结构，利用其创建跨分词器似然评分的概率框架，处理学生词汇表是教师词汇表子集和任意情况。

Result: 在子集场景下，Qwen2.5 - 1.5B模型内存占用最多减少12%，评估任务性能最多提升4%；在一般场景下，数学推理蒸馏GSM8K准确率比现有技术提升超2%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了词汇表不对齐问题，在减少内存占用和提升性能方面表现良好。

Abstract: Computing next-token likelihood ratios between two language models (LMs) is a standard task in training paradigms such as knowledge distillation. Since this requires both models to share the same probability space, it becomes challenging when the teacher and student LMs use different tokenizers, for instance, when edge-device deployment necessitates a smaller vocabulary size to lower memory overhead. In this work, we address this vocabulary misalignment problem by uncovering an implicit recursive structure in the commonly deployed Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm and utilizing it to create a probabilistic framework for cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring. Our method enables sequence likelihood evaluation for vocabularies different from the teacher model native tokenizer, addressing two specific scenarios: when the student vocabulary is a subset of the teacher vocabulary, and the general case where it is arbitrary. In the subset regime, our framework computes exact likelihoods and provides next-token probabilities for sequential sampling with only O(1) model evaluations per token. When used for distillation, this yields up to a 12% reduction in memory footprint for the Qwen2.5-1.5B model while also improving baseline performance up to 4% on the evaluated tasks. For the general case, we introduce a rigorous lossless procedure that leverages BPE recursive structure, complemented by a fast approximation that keeps large-vocabulary settings practical. Applied to distillation for mathematical reasoning, our approach improves GSM8K accuracy by more than 2% over the current state of the art.

Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型问答中因参数知识限制产生幻觉，现有 KG - CoT 方法存在刚性跳数选择和推理路径利用不足问题。

Method: 提出 RFKG - CoT，用关系驱动的自适应跳数选择器替代刚性跳数选择器，引入少样本上下文学习路径引导机制。

Result: 在四个 KGQA 基准测试中，RFKG - CoT 比 KG - CoT 最高提升 14.7 个百分点的准确率（Llama2 - 7B 在 WebQSP 上）。

Conclusion: 跳数选择器和路径提示互补，能将 KG 证据转化为更可靠答案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive QA due to parametric knowledge limitations. While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct "brother" relations, 2-hop for indirect "father-son" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a "question-paths-answer" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在所有生成的token上训练，未探索对推理有贡献的token，影响训练效果。

Method: 提出PPPO方法，利用开始锁定效应聚焦前缀推理，引入渐进式前缀保留和延续累积奖励两种训练策略。

Result: 在多种推理任务实验中，PPPO优于代表性RLVR方法，用26.17%训练token使准确率提升18.02%。

Conclusion: PPPO能有效提升大语言模型推理能力，改善训练效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.

Abstract: Extracting structured information from zeolite synthesis experimental procedures is critical for materials discovery, yet existing methods have not systematically evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) for this domain-specific task. This work addresses a fundamental question: what is the efficacy of different prompting strategies when applying LLMs to scientific information extraction? We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs achieve high-level understanding, precise extraction of experimental parameters requires domain-adapted models, providing quantitative benchmarks for scientific information extraction.

### [230] [Adversarial versification in portuguese as a jailbreak operator in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15353)
*Joao Queiroz*

TL;DR: 研究表明诗歌化提示对对齐的大语言模型有很强的对抗性，暴露了当前对齐机制的局限性，且缺乏葡萄牙语评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前大语言模型对齐机制的局限性以及填补葡萄牙语评估的空白。

Method: 通过将散文指令改写为诗歌进行实验，并在基于MLCommons AILuminate的基准测试中进行验证。

Result: 诗歌化提示使指令执行成功率大幅提升，不同类型模型都出现性能下降，手动写诗ASR约62%，自动版本43%，部分单轮交互成功率超90%。

Conclusion: 当前对齐机制存在深度局限，应进行针对葡萄牙语韵律模式的评估实验。

Abstract: Recent evidence shows that the versification of prompts constitutes a highly effective adversarial mechanism against aligned LLMs. The study 'Adversarial poetry as a universal single-turn jailbreak mechanism in large language models' demonstrates that instructions routinely refused in prose become executable when rewritten as verse, producing up to 18 x more safety failures in benchmarks derived from MLCommons AILuminate. Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions 43%, with some models surpassing 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural: systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines exhibit consistent degradation under minimal semiotic formal variation. Versification displaces the prompt into sparsely supervised latent regions, revealing guardrails that are excessively dependent on surface patterns. This dissociation between apparent robustness and real vulnerability exposes deep limitations in current alignment regimes. The absence of evaluations in Portuguese, a language with high morphosyntactic complexity, a rich metric-prosodic tradition, and over 250 million speakers, constitutes a critical gap. Experimental protocols must parameterise scansion, metre, and prosodic variation to test vulnerabilities specific to Lusophone patterns, which are currently ignored.

Motivation: PEFT方法虽因计算效率高被广泛使用，但在下游问答任务和泛化方面其配置的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 在多个推理和回忆数据集上进行综合评估，进行秩扫描以量化SFT和PEFT的权衡，比较PEFT和SFT模型在域内和域外适应的准确性，通过光谱特征和逐层注意力结构分析内部表示。

Conclusion: 对SFT和PEFT在下游任务和泛化方面有更深入理解，分析内部表示可洞察表示漂移和注意力模式的结构变化。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are two dominant approaches. While PEFT methods are widely used for their computational efficiency, the implications of their configurations (e.g., rank) remain under-explored in downstream Q&A tasks and generalisation. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting. We demonstrate that LoRA achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to SFT, particularly on reasoning tasks at specific rank values. Additionally, we analyze the internal representations via spectral features and layer-wise attention structures, offering insights into representational drift and structural changes in attention patterns.

Motivation: 持续学习面临灾难性遗忘问题，即学习新任务时旧任务性能下降，需要有效方法解决。

Result: 在多种NLP基准测试中，PPSEBM优于最先进的持续学习方法。

Conclusion: PPSEBM是缓解灾难性遗忘有前景和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, requiring models to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A major obstacle in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where performance on earlier tasks degrades as new tasks are learned. In this paper, we introduce PPSEBM, a novel framework that integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS) to effectively address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for natural language processing tasks. In PPSEBM, progressive parameter selection allocates distinct, task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates representative pseudo-samples from prior tasks. These generated samples actively inform and guide the parameter selection process, enhancing the model's ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new tasks. Experimental results on diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that PPSEBM outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods, offering a promising and robust solution to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Result: 

Conclusion: 虽无法从许多自然语言处理任务中获得确定性评估，但通过上述方法可能降低评估误差风险。

Abstract: LLMs (Large Language Models) are increasingly used in text processing pipelines to intelligently respond to a variety of inputs and generation tasks. This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解释大语言模型激活的技术复杂，且先前LatentQA研究聚焦狭窄任务设置，本文希望从通才视角评估LatentQA模型。

Method: 评估LatentQA训练的AOs在远分布外设置中的表现，研究性能随训练数据多样性的变化，在四个下游任务上与先前白盒和黑盒技术对比。

Result: AOs能恢复微调模型中的信息，即使未用微调模型的激活进行训练；即使窄训练的LatentQA模型也能很好泛化，增加训练数据集有进一步提升；最佳AOs在四个任务中匹配或超越先前白盒基线，三个任务表现最佳。

Conclusion: 多样化训练以回答自然语言查询赋予了表达大语言模型激活信息的通用能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) activations are notoriously difficult to understand, with most existing techniques using complex, specialized methods for interpreting them. Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.

Conclusion: 该框架为量子机器学习模型提供概念地图，明确不同模型与经典可模拟性的关系及量子优势可能存在的方向。

Abstract: Demonstrating quantum advantage in machine learning tasks requires navigating a complex landscape of proposed models and algorithms. To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum. This perspective provides a conceptual map of this landscape, clarifying how different models relate to classical simulability and pointing to where opportunities for quantum advantage may lie.

Method: 提出Dual - Assessment for VLM Reliability (DAVR)框架，结合自我反思和跨模型验证进行全面不确定性估计，采用双路径架构评估响应可靠性并减少幻觉。

Result: 在ICCV - CLVL 2025的可靠VQA挑战中，DAVR取得领先的$Φ_{100}$分数39.64和100 - AUC 97.22，获第一名。

Conclusion: DAVR在提高VLM响应的可信度方面是有效的。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the susceptibility of VLMs to hallucinations can lead to overconfident yet incorrect answers, severely undermining answer reliability. To address this, we propose Dual-Assessment for VLM Reliability (DAVR), a novel framework that integrates Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification for comprehensive uncertainty estimation. The DAVR framework features a dual-pathway architecture: one pathway leverages dual selector modules to assess response reliability by fusing VLM latent features with QA embeddings, while the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking to mitigate hallucinations. Evaluated in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025, DAVR achieves a leading $Φ_{100}$ score of 39.64 and a 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the trustworthiness of VLM responses.

Conclusion: 该方法推动脑肿瘤分割研究从复杂模型架构转向高效、临床适配、精确、计算公平且可持续的后处理策略。

Abstract: Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults and are among the most lethal. Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.

Conclusion: 开源数据集、训练方法和模型检查点，降低音频驱动人类视频生成研究门槛。

Abstract: We introduce TalkVerse, a large-scale, open corpus for single-person, audio-driven talking video generation designed to enable fair, reproducible comparison across methods. While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation. Project Page: https://zhenzhiwang.github.io/talkverse/

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image.

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires objective assessment of social behavior to support herd welfare monitoring, yet most existing approaches infer interactions using static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish affiliative from agonistic behaviors in complex barn environments. This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.

Conclusion: 所提协议能按预期发挥作用。

Abstract: Skilled human interviewers can extract valuable information from experts. This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments. Experimental results demonstrate our metric reasonably aligns with question generation settings: models accessing richer context are evaluated better, supporting that our protocol works as intended. The EgoExoAsk dataset is available in https://github.com/omron-sinicx/VQG4ExpertKnowledge .

Conclusion: 所提方法对长视频中超声小目标分割有效。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound videos are widely used for medical inspections, disease diagnosis and surgical planning. High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

Abstract: Generating consistent human images with controllable pose and appearance is essential for applications in virtual try on, image editing, and digital human creation. Current methods often suffer from occlusions, garment style drift, and pose misalignment. We propose Pose-guided Multi-view Multimodal Diffusion (PMMD), a diffusion framework that synthesizes photorealistic person images conditioned on multi-view references, pose maps, and text prompts. A multimodal encoder jointly models visual views, pose features, and semantic descriptions, which reduces cross modal discrepancy and improves identity fidelity. We further design a ResCVA module to enhance local detail while preserving global structure, and a cross modal fusion module that integrates image semantics with text throughout the denoising pipeline. Experiments on the DeepFashion MultiModal dataset show that PMMD outperforms representative baselines in consistency, detail preservation, and controllability.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $Δ$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $Δ$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.

Result: 多数VLMs能完成物体计数，性能匹配甚至超越专用计算机视觉架构，提示生成中间表示可显著提高计数准确性，但模型在复杂场景下不可靠。

Conclusion: 创建能在现实环境中可靠执行计数程序的AI系统还需进一步研究。

Abstract: Counting the number of items in a visual scene remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI影像质量自动评估方法多为二分类且缺乏可解释性，运动伪影会降低影像质量和增加患者复查。

Method: 使用监督对比学习学习运动严重程度的判别表示，在特征空间计算特定等级的亲和度分数。

Conclusion: AutoMAC - MRI结合准确的等级检测和亲和度评分，可用于MRI质量控制，有望减少不必要的扫描并提高工作效率。

Abstract: Motion artifacts degrade MRI image quality and increase patient recalls. Existing automated quality assessment methods are largely limited to binary decisions and provide little interpretability. We introduce AutoMAC-MRI, an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts across heterogeneous MR contrasts and orientations. The approach uses supervised contrastive learning to learn a discriminative representation of motion severity. Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity. By coupling accurate grade detection with per-grade affinity scoring, AutoMAC-MRI enables inline MRI quality control, with the potential to reduce unnecessary rescans and improve workflow efficiency.

Conclusion: 所采用的类人方法能有效从线性刻度读取测量值，可应用于机器人在实验室环境的自主工作中。

Abstract: Capabilities and the number of vision-based models are increasing rapidly. And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed.

Conclusion: Pro - GRPO框架有效解决了GRPO技术中大组规模与计算成本的冲突问题，具有通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a powerful technique for aligning generative models, but its effectiveness is bottlenecked by the conflict between large group sizes and prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.

Result: 在八个基准数据集的广泛实验中，该方法在部分视图对齐聚类问题上始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SMART模型能有效解决部分视图对齐聚类问题，利用好对齐和未对齐数据中的语义关系。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has been empirically shown to improve learning performance by leveraging the inherent complementary information across multiple views of data. However, in real-world scenarios, collecting strictly aligned views is challenging, and learning from both aligned and unaligned data becomes a more practical solution. Partially View-aligned Clustering aims to learn correspondences between misaligned view samples to better exploit the potential consistency and complementarity across views, including both aligned and unaligned data. However, most existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture the shared semantics among samples from the same cluster. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of multi-view data induces distributional shifts in representations, leading to inaccuracies in establishing meaningful correspondences between cross-view latent features and, consequently, impairing learning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model (SMART) for PVC. The main idea of our approach is to alleviate the influence of cross-view distributional shifts, thereby facilitating semantic matching contrastive learning to fully exploit semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches on the PVC problem.

Motivation: 解决手语者情绪识别中语法和情感面部表情重叠以及训练数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用eJSL和BOBSL数据集进行研究，eJSL中有两位手语者以七种情绪表达78种话语得到1092个视频片段。

Result: 证实文本情绪识别可缓解手语数据稀缺，时间片段选择影响大，手部动作能增强情绪识别。

Conclusion: 建立了比口语大语言模型更强的基线。

Abstract: Recognition of signers' emotions suffers from one theoretical challenge and one practical challenge, namely, the overlap between grammatical and affective facial expressions and the scarcity of data for model training. This paper addresses these two challenges in a cross-lingual setting using our eJSL dataset, a new benchmark dataset for emotion recognition in Japanese Sign Language signers, and BOBSL, a large British Sign Language dataset with subtitles. In eJSL, two signers expressed 78 distinct utterances with each of seven different emotional states, resulting in 1,092 video clips. We empirically demonstrate that 1) textual emotion recognition in spoken language mitigates data scarcity in sign language, 2) temporal segment selection has a significant impact, and 3) incorporating hand motion enhances emotion recognition in signers. Finally we establish a stronger baseline than spoken language LLMs.

Method: IMKD采用三阶段强度感知蒸馏策略，包括LiDAR到雷达的特征蒸馏、LiDAR到融合特征的蒸馏和相机 - 雷达的融合机制。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中，IMKD的NDS达67.0%，mAP达61.0%，优于所有基于蒸馏的雷达 - 相机融合方法。

Conclusion: IMKD是一种有效的雷达 - 相机3D目标检测融合框架，可在不使用LiDAR推理时实现高性能检测。

Abstract: High-performance Radar-Camera 3D object detection can be achieved by leveraging knowledge distillation without using LiDAR at inference time. However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频编辑模型无法满足视频VFX编辑中特效与背景融合、背景不变及从有限数据学习特效模式等要求。

Method: 利用源视频作为上下文条件，采用DiT模型的上下文学习能力；使用两阶段训练策略，包括通用编辑适应和通过Effect - LoRA进行特效特定学习；引入时空稀疏标记法。

Result: IC - Effect实现了高质量、可控且时间一致的VFX编辑。

Conclusion: IC - Effect为视频创作开辟了新可能。

Abstract: We propose \textbf{IC-Effect}, an instruction-guided, DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that synthesizes complex effects (\eg flames, particles and cartoon characters) while strictly preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Video VFX editing is highly challenging because injected effects must blend seamlessly with the background, the background must remain entirely unchanged, and effect patterns must be learned efficiently from limited paired data. However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation. We also release a paired VFX editing dataset spanning $15$ high-quality visual styles. Extensive experiments show that IC-Effect delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing, opening new possibilities for video creation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer in order to address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions. We show that although applying style transfer on synthetic images degrades their quality with respect to the common FID metric, these images are surprisingly beneficial for model training. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the effects of both augmentations and their key hyperparameters on the performance of image classifiers. Our results demonstrate that stylization and synthetic data complement each other well and can be combined with popular rule-based data augmentation techniques such as TrivialAugment, while not working with others. Our method achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness on several small-scale image classification benchmarks, reaching 93.54%, 74.9% and 50.86% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and TinyImageNet-C, respectively

Method: 引入首个VTC基准测试，设置VTC - Retrieval、VTC - Reasoning、VTC - Memory三种长上下文理解场景评估VLMs，建立VTCBench - Wild模拟多样输入场景，对开源和专有模型进行评估。

Result: 多数VLMs虽能较好解码文本信息，但对VTC压缩信息的长上下文理解能力差，无法捕捉上下文长关联或依赖。

Conclusion: 本研究加深对VTC理解，为设计更高效可扩展的VLMs奠定基础。

Abstract: The computational and memory overheads associated with expanding the context window of LLMs severely limit their scalability. A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.

Abstract: Existing video generation models struggle to maintain long-term spatial and temporal consistency due to the dense, high-dimensional nature of video signals. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatia, a spatial memory-aware video generation framework that explicitly preserves a 3D scene point cloud as persistent spatial memory. Spatia iteratively generates video clips conditioned on this spatial memory and continuously updates it through visual SLAM. This dynamic-static disentanglement design enhances spatial consistency throughout the generation process while preserving the model's ability to produce realistic dynamic entities. Furthermore, Spatia enables applications such as explicit camera control and 3D-aware interactive editing, providing a geometrically grounded framework for scalable, memory-driven video generation.

Result: 初始实验证实了所提系统的正确性和隐私性。

Conclusion: 该方法确保数据机密性，可跨多方扩展，能在不共享原始数据和训练模型情况下实现公平数据估值。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, ensuring data privacy. In Vertical FL (VFL), where each party holds different features for the same users, a key challenge is to evaluate the feature contribution of each party before any model is trained, particularly in the early stages when no model exists. To address this, the Shapley-CMI method was recently proposed as a model-free, information-theoretic approach to feature valuation using Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). However, its original formulation did not provide a practical implementation capable of computing the required permutations and intersections securely. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving implementation of Shapley-CMI for VFL. Our system introduces a private set intersection (PSI) server that performs all necessary feature permutations and computes encrypted intersection sizes across discretized and encrypted ID groups, without the need for raw data exchange. Each party then uses these intersection results to compute Shapley-CMI values, computing the marginal utility of their features. Initial experiments confirm the correctness and privacy of the proposed system, demonstrating its viability for secure and efficient feature contribution estimation in VFL. This approach ensures data confidentiality, scales across multiple parties, and enables fair data valuation without requiring the sharing of raw data or training models.

Result: SEBERTIS训练的分类器在10000份GitHub问题报告上F1分数达0.9880，远超基于ML和LLM的基线模型。

Conclusion: SEBERTIS框架有效，训练的分类器能独立于词汇线索，更好地检测安全相关问题。

Abstract: Monitoring issue tracker submissions is a crucial software maintenance activity. A key goal is the prioritization of high risk, security-related bugs. If such bugs can be recognized early, the risk of propagation to dependent products and endangerment of stakeholder benefits can be mitigated. To assist triage engineers with this task, several automatic detection techniques, from Machine Learning (ML) models to prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), have been proposed. Although promising to some extent, prior techniques often memorize lexical cues as decision shortcuts, yielding low detection rate specifically for more complex submissions. As such, these classifiers do not yet reach the practical expectations of a real-time detector of security-related issues. To address these limitations, we propose SEBERTIS, a framework to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as classifiers independent of lexical cues, so that they can confidently detect fully unseen security-related issues. SEBERTIS capitalizes on fine-tuning bidirectional transformer architectures as Masked Language Models (MLMs) on a series of semantically equivalent vocabulary to prediction labels (which we call Semantic Surrogates) when they have been replaced with a mask. Our SEBERTIS-trained classifier achieves a 0.9880 F1-score in detecting security-related issues of a curated corpus of 10,000 GitHub issue reports, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art issue classifiers, with 14.44%-96.98%, 15.40%-93.07%, and 14.90%-94.72% higher detection precision, recall, and F1-score over ML-based baselines. Our classifier also substantially surpasses LLM baselines, with an improvement of 23.20%-63.71%, 36.68%-85.63%, and 39.49%-74.53% for precision, recall, and F1-score.

Abstract: Large-scale, standardized datasets for Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) research are scarce, and inconsistent actor aliases and redundant samples hinder reproducibility. This paper presents APT-ClaritySet and its construction pipeline that normalizes threat actor aliases (reconciling approximately 11.22\% of inconsistent names) and applies graph-feature deduplication -- reducing the subset of statically analyzable executables by 47.55\% while retaining behaviorally distinct variants. APT-ClaritySet comprises: (i) APT-ClaritySet-Full, the complete pre-deduplication collection with 34{,}363 malware samples attributed to 305 APT groups (2006 - early 2025); (ii) APT-ClaritySet-Unique, the deduplicated release with 25{,}923 unique samples spanning 303 groups and standardized attributions; and (iii) APT-ClaritySet-FuncReuse, a function-level resource that includes 324{,}538 function-reuse clusters (FRCs) enabling measurement of inter-/intra-group sharing, evolution, and tooling lineage. By releasing these components and detailing the alias normalization and scalable deduplication pipeline, this work provides a high-fidelity, reproducible foundation for quantitative studies of APT patterns, evolution, and attribution.

Conclusion: 这是首个能在不暴露消息内容和不损害代理隐私的情况下提供可验证相互审计的隐私保护审计系统。

Abstract: Existing agent communication frameworks face critical limitations in providing verifiable audit trails without compromising the privacy and confidentiality of agent interactions. The protection of agent communication privacy while ensuring auditability emerges as a fundamental challenge for applications requiring accurate billing, compliance verification, and accountability in regulated environments.
  We introduce a framework for auditing agent communications that keeps messages private while still checking they follow expected rules. It pairs zero-knowledge proofs with the existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) so messages can be verified without revealing their contents. The approach runs in lightweight networks, stays compatible with standard MCP exchanges, and adds asynchronous audit verification to confirm format and general message types without exposing specifics.
  The framework enables mutual audits between agents: one side can check communication content and quality while the other verifies usage metrics, all without revealing sensitive information. We formalize security goals and show that zk-MCP provides data authenticity and communication privacy, achieving efficient verification with negligible latency overhead. We fully implement the framework, including Circom-based zero-knowledge proof generation and an audit protocol integrated with MCP's bidirectional channel, and, to our knowledge, this is the first privacy-preserving audit system for agent communications that offers verifiable mutual auditing without exposing message content or compromising agent privacy.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型植入后门在多阶段微调后的持续性，提出P - Trojan算法，实验证明其后门持续性超99%，强调需进行持续性评估和更强防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少关注大语言模型植入后门在用户驱动的部署后持续微调下的持续性，多数仅在模型发布时评估。

Method: 提出P - Trojan触发式攻击算法，通过使中毒梯度与干净任务在词嵌入上对齐，优化后门在多次更新中的持续性。

Result: 理论分析证明持续微调后持久后门攻击可行，在Qwen2.5和LLaMA3等模型及多样任务序列实验中，P - Trojan后门持续性超99%且保持干净任务准确性。

Conclusion: 在实际模型适配流程中需要进行持续性感知评估和更强的防御。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed malicious behaviors into Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling adversaries to trigger harmful outputs or bypass safety controls. However, the persistence of the implanted backdoors under user-driven post-deployment continual fine-tuning has been rarely examined. Most prior works evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of implanted backdoors only at releasing and empirical evidence shows that naively injected backdoor persistence degrades after updates. In this work, we study whether and how implanted backdoors persist through a multi-stage post-deployment fine-tuning. We propose P-Trojan, a trigger-based attack algorithm that explicitly optimizes for backdoor persistence across repeated updates. By aligning poisoned gradients with those of clean tasks on token embeddings, the implanted backdoor mapping is less likely to be suppressed or forgotten during subsequent updates. Theoretical analysis shows the feasibility of such persistent backdoor attacks after continual fine-tuning. And experiments conducted on the Qwen2.5 and LLaMA3 families of LLMs, as well as diverse task sequences, demonstrate that P-Trojan achieves over 99% persistence while preserving clean-task accuracy. Our findings highlight the need for persistence-aware evaluation and stronger defenses in realistic model adaptation pipelines.

*Tan Le,Van Le,Sachin Shetty*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出一种分层防御框架，融合混合量子计算与机器学习用于O - RAN网络安全防护，经测试有良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O - RAN提高了模块化和遥测粒度，但也扩大了网络安全攻击面，需要有效防御框架。

Method: 提出分层防御框架，包括异常检测、入侵确认和多攻击分类三层，整合混合量子计算和机器学习，利用基于振幅和纠缠的特征编码及深度与集成分类器。

Result: 框架在合成和真实的遥测数据基准测试中始终实现了近乎完美的准确性、高召回率和强类别可分性。

Conclusion: 多方面评估证实该框架具有可解释性、鲁棒性，适合切片感知诊断，可在近实时和非实时RIC领域扩展部署。

Abstract: Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) enhance modularity and telemetry granularity but also widen the cybersecurity attack surface across disaggregated control, user and management planes. We propose a hierarchical defense framework with three coordinated layers-anomaly detection, intrusion confirmation, and multiattack classification-each aligned with O-RAN's telemetry stack. Our approach integrates hybrid quantum computing and machine learning, leveraging amplitude- and entanglement-based feature encodings with deep and ensemble classifiers. We conduct extensive benchmarking across synthetic and real-world telemetry, evaluating encoding depth, architectural variants, and diagnostic fidelity. The framework consistently achieves near-perfect accuracy, high recall, and strong class separability. Multi-faceted evaluation across decision boundaries, probabilistic margins, and latent space geometry confirms its interpretability, robustness, and readiness for slice-aware diagnostics and scalable deployment in near-RT and non-RT RIC domains.

TL;DR: 随着AI能力提升，研究复杂任务分解中分解器恶意问题，引入Factor(U,T)，实验对比不同模式监测效果，发现实施上下文监测更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作使用可信但较弱模型进行任务分解限制了在分解任务有挑战场景中的实用性，且需探讨仅观察自然语言任务指令能否检测恶意活动。

Method: 引入Factor(U,T)，在BigCodeBench数据集上进行控制评估，对比不同监测方式。

Result: 仅监测分解恶意与诚实情况的效果差（AUROC 0.52），评估完整Python解决方案的监测器效果好（AUROC 0.96），Factor(D,U)实现优秀区分度（AUROC 0.96）和强安全性（1.2% ASR）。

Conclusion: 实施上下文监测能在仅分解监测失败的情况下取得成功。

Abstract: As AI capabilities advance, we increasingly rely on powerful models to decompose complex tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ but what if the decomposer itself is malicious? Factored cognition protocols decompose complex tasks into simpler child tasks: one model creates the decomposition, while other models implement the child tasks in isolation. Prior work uses trusted (weaker but reliable) models for decomposition, which limits usefulness for tasks where decomposition itself is challenging. We introduce Factor($U$,$T$), in which an untrusted (stronger but potentially malicious) model decomposes while trusted models implement child tasks. Can monitors detect malicious activity when observing only natural language task instructions, rather than complete solutions? We baseline and red team Factor($U$,$T$) in control evaluations on BigCodeBench, a dataset of Python coding tasks. Monitors distinguishing malicious from honest decompositions perform poorly (AUROC 0.52) compared to monitors evaluating complete Python solutions (AUROC 0.96). Furthermore, Factor($D$,$U$), which uses a trusted decomposer and monitors concrete child solutions, achieves excellent discrimination (AUROC 0.96) and strong safety (1.2% ASR), demonstrating that implementation-context monitoring succeeds where decomposition-only monitoring fails.

Motivation: 探究微调后的大语言模型是否会继承预训练模型的越狱漏洞，明确微调范式的安全影响。

Method: 在预训练到微调的威胁模型下进行实证分析，开展表示层探测，提出Probe - Guided Projection (PGP)攻击方法。

Result: 预训练模型上优化的对抗性提示能有效转移到微调变体，可转移提示在预训练隐藏状态下线性可分，PGP攻击在多模型和任务中转移成功率高。

Conclusion: 预训练到微调的范式存在固有的安全风险。

Abstract: Finetuning pretrained large language models (LLMs) has become the standard paradigm for developing downstream applications. However, its security implications remain unclear, particularly regarding whether finetuned LLMs inherit jailbreak vulnerabilities from their pretrained sources. We investigate this question in a realistic pretrain-to-finetune threat model, where the attacker has white-box access to the pretrained LLM and only black-box access to its finetuned derivatives. Empirical analysis shows that adversarial prompts optimized on the pretrained model transfer most effectively to its finetuned variants, revealing inherited vulnerabilities from pretrained to finetuned LLMs. To further examine this inheritance, we conduct representation-level probing, which shows that transferable prompts are linearly separable within the pretrained hidden states, suggesting that universal transferability is encoded in pretrained representations. Building on this insight, we propose the Probe-Guided Projection (PGP) attack, which steers optimization toward transferability-relevant directions. Experiments across multiple LLM families and diverse finetuned tasks confirm PGP's strong transfer success, underscoring the security risks inherent in the pretrain-to-finetune paradigm.

Motivation: 防止大语言模型被滥用，特别是保护代码中的知识产权，但现有代码水印方法无法应对注释移除攻击，且代码低熵特性使水印注入困难。

Method: 利用提示词列表区分代码的低熵和高熵部分，据此注入水印。

Result: 在HumanEval上评估该方法，并与三种先进代码水印技术对比，结果证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的代码水印方法比现有方法具有更高的可检测性和可用性。

Abstract: Watermarking large language models (LLMs) is vital for preventing their misuse, including the fabrication of fake news, plagiarism, and spam. It is especially important to watermark LLM-generated code, as it often contains intellectual property.However, we found that existing methods for watermarking LLM-generated code fail to address comment removal attack.In such cases, an attacker can simply remove the comments from the generated code without affecting its functionality, significantly reducing the effectiveness of current code-watermarking techniques.On the other hand, injecting a watermark into code is challenging because, as previous works have noted, most code represents a low-entropy scenario compared to natural language. Our approach to addressing this issue involves leveraging prior knowledge to distinguish between low-entropy and high-entropy parts of the code, as indicated by a Cue List of words.We then inject the watermark guided by this Cue List, achieving higher detectability and usability than existing methods.We evaluated our proposed method on HumanEvaland compared our method with three state-of-the-art code watermarking techniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 传统集中式安全工具难以应对自适应、多向量攻击，需要新的防御框架。

Method: 构建包含检测、情报、响应和分析四个大语言模型智能体的MALCDF，通过安全通信层通信，用CICIDS2017数据集进行评估，训练轻量级随机森林IDS作为基线。

Result: MALCDF检测准确率达90.0%，F1分数85.7%，误报率9.1%，平均单事件延迟6.8秒，性能优于基线和单大语言模型设置。

Conclusion: 通过安全、本体对齐消息协调简单大语言模型智能体，可提升实际实时网络防御能力。

Abstract: Traditional, centralized security tools often miss adaptive, multi-vector attacks. We present the Multi-Agent LLM Cyber Defense Framework (MALCDF), a practical setup where four large language model (LLM) agents-Detection, Intelligence, Response, and Analysis-work together in real time. Agents communicate over a Secure Communication Layer (SCL) with encrypted, ontology-aligned messages, and produce audit-friendly outputs (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK mappings).
  For evaluation, we keep the test simple and consistent: all reported metrics come from the same 50-record live stream derived from the CICIDS2017 feature schema. CICIDS2017 is used for configuration (fields/schema) and to train a practical ML baseline. The ML-IDS baseline is a Lightweight Random Forest IDS (LRF-IDS) trained on a subset of CICIDS2017 and tested on the 50-record stream, with no overlap between training and test records.
  In experiments, MALCDF reaches 90.0% detection accuracy, 85.7% F1-score, and 9.1% false-positive rate, with 6.8s average per-event latency. It outperforms the lightweight ML-IDS baseline and a single-LLM setup on accuracy while keeping end-to-end outputs consistent. Overall, this hands-on build suggests that coordinating simple LLM agents with secure, ontology-aligned messaging can improve practical, real-time cyber defense.

Abstract: Agentic AI introduces security vulnerabilities that traditional LLM safeguards fail to address. Although recent work by Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks demonstrated that ChatGPT-4o successfully executes attacks as an agent that it refuses in chat mode, there is no comparative analysis in multiple models and frameworks. We conducted the first systematic penetration testing and comparative evaluation of agentic AI systems, testing five prominent models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 2, and Nova Pro) across two agentic AI frameworks (AutoGen and CrewAI) using a seven-agent architecture that mimics the functionality of a university information management system and 13 distinct attack scenarios that span prompt injection, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), SQL injection, and tool misuse. Our 130 total test cases reveal significant security disparities: AutoGen demonstrates a 52.3% refusal rate versus CrewAI's 30.8%, while model performance ranges from Nova Pro's 46.2% to Claude and Grok 2's 38.5%. Most critically, Grok 2 on CrewAI rejected only 2 of 13 attacks (15.4% refusal rate), and the overall refusal rate of 41.5% across all configurations indicates that more than half of malicious prompts succeeded despite enterprise-grade safety mechanisms. We identify six distinct defensive behavior patterns including a novel "hallucinated compliance" strategy where models fabricate outputs rather than executing or refusing attacks, and provide actionable recommendations for secure agent deployment. Complete attack prompts are also included in the Appendix to enable reproducibility.

Result: 基线系统攻击成功率高，总预期损失31.3万美元；ABAC使部分攻击成功率近零，总预期损失降低94%，RoC为9.83；NER消除PII泄漏，RoC为5.97；NeMo Guardrails效益微弱，RoC为0.05。

Conclusion: ABAC在大语言模型系统防护中效果最佳，能显著降低风险和损失，获取高回报；NER也有较好效果；NeMo Guardrails效益不明显。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in security-critical workflows, practitioners lack quantitative guidance on which safeguards are worth deploying. This paper introduces a decision-oriented framework and reproducible methodology that together quantify residual risk, convert adversarial probe outcomes into financial risk estimates and return-on-control (RoC) metrics, and enable monetary comparison of layered defenses for LLM-based systems. A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) service is instantiated using the DeepSeek-R1 model over a corpus containing synthetic personally identifiable information (PII), and subjected to automated attacks with Garak across five vulnerability classes: PII leakage, latent context injection, prompt injection, adversarial attack generation, and divergence. For each (vulnerability, control) pair, attack success probabilities are estimated via Laplace's Rule of Succession and combined with loss triangle distributions, calibrated from public breach-cost data, in 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Three widely used mitigations, attribute-based access control (ABAC); named entity recognition (NER) redaction using Microsoft Presidio; and NeMo Guardrails, are then compared to a baseline RAG configuration. The baseline system exhibits very high attack success rates (>= 0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), yielding a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC collapses success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero and reduces the total expected loss by ~94%, achieving an RoC of 9.83. NER redaction likewise eliminates PII leakage and attains an RoC of 5.97, while NeMo Guardrails provides only marginal benefit (RoC of 0.05).

Result: 在受控条件下融合实现了高达1.00的宏F1分数，但在噪声更多、更多样化的环境中性能会有所不同。

Conclusion: 简单的校准融合可以在资源受限、对成本敏感的设置中增强云SOC能力。

Abstract: Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC) enable cloud governance, risk and compliance by providing insights visibility and control. Cloud SOC triages high-volume, heterogeneous telemetry from elastic, short-lived resources while staying within tight budgets. In this research, we implement an AI-Augmented Security Operations Center (AISOC) on AWS that combines cloud-native instrumentation with ML-based detection. The architecture uses three Amazon EC2 instances: Attacker, Defender, and Monitoring. We simulate a reverse-shell intrusion with Metasploit, and Filebeat forwards Defender logs to an Elasticsearch and Kibana stack for analysis. We train two classifiers, a malware detector built on a public dataset and a log-anomaly detector trained on synthetically augmented logs that include adversarial variants. We calibrate and fuse the scores to produce multi-modal threat intelligence and triage activity into NORMAL, SUSPICIOUS, and HIGH\_CONFIDENCE\_ATTACK. On held-out tests the fusion achieves strong macro-F1 (up to 1.00) under controlled conditions, though performance will vary in noisier and more diverse environments. These results indicate that simple, calibrated fusion can enhance cloud SOC capabilities in constrained, cost-sensitive setups.

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has evolved modern transportation through enhanced connectivity and intelligent systems. However, this increased connectivity introduces critical vulnerabilities, making vehicles susceptible to cyber-attacks such Denial-ofService (DoS) and message spoofing. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based intrusion detection system to classify malicious Controller Area network (CAN) bus traffic using the CiCIoV2024 benchmark dataset. We analyzed various attack patterns including DoS and spoofing attacks targeting critical vehicle parameters such as Spoofing-GAS - gas pedal position, Spoofing-RPM, Spoofing-Speed, and Spoofing-Steering\_Wheel. Our initial findings confirm a multi-class classification problem with a clear structural difference between attack types and benign data, providing a strong foundation for machine learning models.

Result: 在多种场景下性能优于现有基线架构，推理延迟低于毫秒级。

Conclusion: AIMformer适用于车内和路边基础设施部署。

Abstract: Vehicular platooning promises transformative improvements in transportation efficiency and safety through the coordination of multi-vehicle formations enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. However, the distributed nature of platoon coordination creates security vulnerabilities, allowing authenticated vehicles to inject falsified kinematic data, compromise operational stability, and pose a threat to passenger safety. Traditional misbehaviour detection approaches, which rely on plausibility checks and statistical methods, suffer from high False Positive (FP) rates and cannot capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-vehicle coordination dynamics. We present Attention In Motion (AIMformer), a transformer-based framework specifically tailored for real-time misbehaviour detection in vehicular platoons with edge deployment capabilities. AIMformer leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations. It incorporates global positional encoding with vehicle-specific temporal offsets to handle join/exit maneuvers. We propose a Precision-Focused (BCE) loss function that penalizes FPs to meet the requirements of safety-critical vehicular systems. Extensive evaluation across 4 platoon controllers, multiple attack vectors, and diverse mobility scenarios demonstrates superior performance ($\geq$ 0.93) compared to state-of-the-art baseline architectures. A comprehensive deployment analysis utilizing TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and TensorRT achieves sub-millisecond inference latency, making it suitable for real-time operation on resource-constrained edge platforms. Hence, validating AIMformer is viable for both in-vehicle and roadside infrastructure deployment.

Abstract: Future AI agents might run autonomously with elevated privileges. If these agents are misaligned, they might abuse these privileges to cause serious damage. The field of AI control develops techniques that make it harder for misaligned AIs to cause such damage, while preserving their usefulness. We introduce BashArena, a setting for studying AI control techniques in security-critical environments. BashArena contains 637 Linux system administration and infrastructure engineering tasks in complex, realistic environments, along with four sabotage objectives (execute malware, exfiltrate secrets, escalate privileges, and disable firewall) for a red team to target. We evaluate multiple frontier LLMs on their ability to complete tasks, perform sabotage undetected, and detect sabotage attempts. Claude Sonnet 4.5 successfully executes sabotage while evading monitoring by GPT-4.1 mini 26% of the time, at 4% trajectory-wise FPR. Our findings provide a baseline for designing more effective control protocols in BashArena. We release the dataset as a ControlArena setting and share our task generation pipeline.
