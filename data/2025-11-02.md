### [1] [Towards Piece-by-Piece Explanations for Chess Positions with SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25775)
*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探索将SHAP应用于国际象棋分析，计算每颗棋子对引擎评估的贡献，有新应用前景并开源代码数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代国际象棋引擎评估结果精确但不透明，难以了解单个棋子或模式的贡献，因此要将SHAP应用于国际象棋分析。

Method: 将棋子视为特征并系统地去除它们，计算每颗棋子的累加贡献。

Result: 提出的方法能以局部忠实且人类可解释的方式解释引擎输出。

Conclusion: 该方法为可视化、人类训练和引擎比较开辟新可能，开源代码和数据以促进可解释国际象棋AI研究。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

### [2] [An Agentic Framework for Rapid Deployment of Edge AI Solutions in Industry 5.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25813)
*Jorge Martinez-Gil,Mario Pichler,Nefeli Bountouni,Sotiris Koussouris,Marielena Márquez Barreiro,Sergio Gusmeroli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出适用于工业5.0的框架，可简化AI模型在边缘设备部署，初步评估显示有性能提升，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化AI模型在不同工业场景边缘设备上的部署。

Method: 设计基于本地推理和实时处理以减少延迟和避免外部数据传输，采用基于代理的实现方式，支持模块化集成且资源需求低。

Result: 在食品行业真实场景的初步评估中，部署时间和系统适应性性能得到改善。

Conclusion: 该框架具有有效性，利于工业5.0中AI模型在边缘设备上的部署。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for Industry 5.0 that simplifies the deployment
of AI models on edge devices in various industrial settings. The design reduces
latency and avoids external data transfer by enabling local inference and
real-time processing. Our implementation is agent-based, which means that
individual agents, whether human, algorithmic, or collaborative, are
responsible for well-defined tasks, enabling flexibility and simplifying
integration. Moreover, our framework supports modular integration and maintains
low resource requirements. Preliminary evaluations concerning the food industry
in real scenarios indicate improved deployment time and system adaptability
performance. The source code is publicly available at

### [3] [Symbolically Scaffolded Play: Designing Role-Sensitive Prompts for Generative NPC Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25820)
*Vanessa Figueiredo,David Elumeze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究在基于GPT - 4o的语音侦探游戏中不同约束提示对玩家体验的影响，提出Symbolically Scaffolded Play框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨受限提示是否能改善玩家在使用大语言模型驱动的互动游戏中的体验。

Method: 通过内部受试者可用性研究对比高、低约束提示，将高约束提示重新设计为混合JSON + RAG支架并进行合成评估。

Result: 高、低约束提示在玩家体验上无可靠差异；支架效果因角色而异；推翻了更严格约束能增强游戏体验的假设。

Conclusion: 提出Symbolically Scaffolded Play框架，可在需要时稳定连贯性，同时保留即兴发挥。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

### [4] [Through the Judge's Eyes: Inferred Thinking Traces Improve Reliability of LLM Raters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25860)
*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出人-大语言模型协作框架从仅含标签的注释中推断思维痕迹，用于微调大语言模型评分器和完善注释指南，提升了大语言模型与人类的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在主观任务评估中可靠性有限，思维痕迹信息丰富但收集整理困难。

Method: 提出人-大语言模型协作框架，使用拒绝采样方法大规模重建思维痕迹，将其应用于微调开放大语言模型评分器和完善专有大语言模型注释指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提高了大语言模型与人类的一致性，完善的注释指南增加了不同大语言模型之间的一致性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可作为未揭示的人类思维痕迹的实用代理，将仅含标签的语料库扩展为增强大语言模型评分器可靠性的资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

### [5] [The Information-Theoretic Imperative: Compression and the Epistemic Foundations of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25883)
*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ITI和CEP两级框架，解释压缩与因果结构发现的关系，表明智能是结构化环境中持久存在的必然结果，且框架有可实证预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架未充分说明压缩为何能促使发现因果结构而非表面统计模式，需填补这一空白。

Method: 引入信息理论必要性（ITI）和压缩效率原则（CEP）构建两级框架。

Result: 框架定义了从生存压力到现实对齐的因果链，且得出可实证的预测。

Conclusion: ITI和CEP为生物、人工和多尺度系统的收敛提供统一解释，无需意识或主观经验假设。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

### [6] [Humains-Junior: A 3.8B Language Model Achieving GPT-4o-Level Factual Accuracy by Directed Exoskeleton Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25933)
*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一个38亿参数的模型在Q1 - Q500上达到与GPT - 4o在±5个百分点内相当的FACTS准确率。云定价显示其成本约为GPT - 4o的1/19，自托管/边缘部署边际成本可趋近于零。附录E列出定价来源，附录F总结前沿仅提示增益和早期评判下的优化提示探索结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能在FACTS任务上达到与GPT - 4o相当水平且成本更低的模型。

Method: 将最小化的定向“外骨骼推理”支架与行为微调相结合，这种微调教授协议合规性而非特定领域答案，二者结合有协同效应且能减少方差。

Result: 在相同评判下，GPT - 4o在Q1 - Q500得分73.5%，Humans - Junior得分72.7%，配对差异0.8个百分点；TOST在±5个百分点内确立等价性；Humans - Junior的基础模型在微软AI Foundry定价下成本约为GPT - 4o的1/19，自托管或边缘部署可降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 38亿参数的Humans - Junior模型能在FACTS任务上达到与GPT - 4o相当的准确率，且成本更低。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

### [7] [Approximating Human Preferences Using a Multi-Judge Learned System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25884)
*Eitán Sprejer,Fernando Avalos,Augusto Bernardi,Jose Pedro Brito de Azevedo Faustino,Jacob Haimes,Narmeen Fatimah Oozeer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出建模多样、基于角色偏好的框架，通过聚合多评分标准裁判输出，对比基线并评估鲁棒性，有合成偏好标签方法和两种聚合器实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于大语言模型的裁判与人类偏好对齐的挑战，推进相关关键应用。

Method: 提出通过学习聚合多评分标准裁判输出建模多样、基于角色偏好的框架，有合成偏好标签的基于角色方法，以及GAM和MLP两种聚合器实现。

Result: 文中未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 文中未明确提及具体结论。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

### [8] [SciTrust 2.0: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Trustworthiness of Large Language Models in Scientific Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25908)
*Emily Herron,Junqi Yin,Feiyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍SciTrust 2.0评估框架评估大语言模型在科学应用中的可信度，评估七种模型，通用模型表现更好，开源框架推动可信AI发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险场景部署时存在可信度问题，需评估其在科学应用中的可信度。

Method: 引入SciTrust 2.0框架，从四个维度评估，用多种评估指标，包含新的真实性和伦理基准。

Result: 通用行业模型在各可信度维度上总体优于科学专业模型，科学专业模型在逻辑、伦理推理和安全评估上有缺陷。

Conclusion: 开源框架为开发更可信AI系统、推进科学场景下模型安全和伦理研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

*Ngoc Phuoc An Vo,Manish Kesarwani,Ruchi Mahindru,Chandrasekhar Narayanaswami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章提出利用自主、目标驱动的AI智能体实现FinOps自动化，构建系统模拟端到端流程，评估显示智能体表现媲美FinOps从业者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinOps从业者面临来自多源的异构计费数据处理难题，影响洞察合成和决策。

Method: 构建用于IT基础设施和成本优化的FinOps智能体，搭建模拟端到端行业流程的系统，定义评估指标。

Result: 使用多种语言模型评估表明，智能体能够像实际的FinOps从业者一样理解、规划和执行任务。

Conclusion: 利用自主、目标驱动的AI智能体实现FinOps自动化是可行的，且能有效应对多源异构计费数据处理挑战。

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

### [10] [Estimating cognitive biases with attention-aware inverse planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25951)
*Sounak Banerjee,Daphne Cornelisse,Deepak Gopinath,Emily Sumner,Jonathan DeCastro,Guy Rosman,Eugene Vinitsky,Mark K. Ho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文基于计算认知科学，提出注意力感知逆规划问题，展示其与标准逆强化学习的差异，给出结合深度强化学习和计算认知建模的方法，并在真实驾驶场景验证可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们的目标导向行为受认知偏差影响，与人类交互的自主系统应考虑这点，故要从人的行为中估计其注意力偏差。

Method: 提出注意力感知逆规划问题，结合深度强化学习与计算认知建模。

Result: 展示了注意力感知逆规划与标准逆强化学习的差异，能从行为中推断认知偏差，在真实驾驶场景中验证了估计认知偏差的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 注意力感知逆规划可用于从行为中估计认知偏差，且具有可扩展性。

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

### [11] [GraphCompliance: Aligning Policy and Context Graphs for LLM-Based Regulatory Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26309)
*Jiseong Chung,Ronny Ko,Wonchul Yoo,Makoto Onizuka,Sungmok Kim,Tae-Wan Kim,Won-Yong Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GraphCompliance框架，将监管文本和运行时上下文表示为图并对齐，在实验中表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络规模合规面临挑战，需将非结构化文本语义信息与监管的结构化规范元素对齐。

Method: 引入GraphCompliance框架，将监管文本表示为策略图，运行时上下文表示为上下文图并对齐，用结构化信息辅助大语言模型推理。

Result: 在300个GDPR衍生的真实场景的五项评估任务中，GraphCompliance的微F1比仅使用大语言模型和RAG基线高4.1 - 7.2个百分点，预测误差更少。

Conclusion: 结构化表示和大语言模型在规范推理中具有互补性。

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

*Manu Redd,Tao Zhe,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于Mistral的ReAct代理编排的管道，提升自然语言到SQL系统处理时空查询的能力，准确性高且增强可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自然语言到SQL系统在处理现实时空查询时存在困难，需要改进。

Method: 用基于Mistral的ReAct代理编排扩展llama - 3 - sqlcoder - 8b基线，代理通过模式检查、SQL生成、执行和可视化工具进行查询规划、分解和调整。

Result: 在35个自然语言查询上，代理准确率达91.4%，远高于基线的28.6%，且通过多种形式增强可用性。

Conclusion: 代理编排是交互式地理空间助手有前景的基础，而非仅依赖更强的SQL生成器。

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出LINK - KG框架用于从法律案例文档构建知识图谱，减少节点重复和噪声节点，为分析复杂犯罪网络奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络复杂难分析，法律案例文档构建知识图谱存在挑战，现有方法有不足。

Method: 提出LINK - KG模块化框架，集成三阶段、大语言模型引导的共指消解管道和下游知识图谱提取，使用特定类型的提示缓存。

Result: 与基线方法相比，LINK - KG使平均节点重复率降低45.21%，噪声节点减少32.22%，图结构更清晰连贯。

Conclusion: LINK - KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

### [15] [Large Language Model-assisted Autonomous Vehicle Recovery from Immobilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26023)
*Zhipeng Bao,Qianwen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出用于自动驾驶汽车的StuckSolver恢复框架，经评估，该框架自主推理性能接近最优，结合乘客指导有进一步提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶汽车在特定交通场景易陷入停滞，现有恢复解决方案成本高、效率低、可及性差。

Method: 引入基于大语言模型的StuckSolver恢复框架，作为插件模块在现有感知 - 规划 - 控制栈上运行，通过标准传感器数据流检测停滞状态、解读环境并生成恢复命令。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准和自定义不确定性场景中评估，仅自主推理时性能接近最优，结合乘客指导有进一步提升。

Conclusion: StuckSolver框架能有效帮助自动驾驶汽车解决停滞问题，结合乘客指导效果更佳。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

Method: 将问责的一般定义与AI联系起来，说明AI问责和不问责的含义

Result: 未提及具体研究结果

Conclusion: 探索让所有AI对受其影响者负责的方法

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在GUI任务自动化中落后于人类，现有训练方案无法完全解决缺少核心GUI知识的问题。

Method: 分析GUI任务执行的常见失败模式，将GUI知识提炼为三个维度，引入GUI Knowledge Bench基准进行评估，在真实GUI任务上做实验。

Result: 当前VLMs能识别小部件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测动作和验证任务完成方面存在困难，实验验证了GUI知识与任务成功的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 工作为下游训练前选择更有潜力的VLMs提供支持，为构建更强大的GUI智能体提供见解。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Result: 在Qwen3 - 4B和Llama - 3.1 - 8B上评估有一致提升，消融实验和分析表明两阶段都必要。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum能提供通用推理的简易方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing the development of autonomous AI
research agents for scientific and engineering discovery. We present FM Agent,
a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic
combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to
address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several
key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert

3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and
LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution
infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has
been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine
learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM
Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human
interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench
(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new
state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.
Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both
large-scale enterprise R\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,
where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and
deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal

Method: 提出用基于规则评分和多维采样构建成对偏好数据的新管道，构建ToolPref - Pairwise - 30K数据集；引入基于BFCL的评估基准TRBench$_{BFCL}$。

Result: Qwen3 - 4B/8B系列模型在成对奖励判断中准确率比Claude 4和OpenAI o3高14.28%；在ACEBench实验中能实现推理时扩展，减少超66%输出令牌使用。

Conclusion: ToolRM有效且高效，能泛化到更广泛的评估任务，发布数据和模型利于未来研究。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Method: 引入QASU基准，探究六种结构技能，涵盖六种序列化格式和多种提示策略。

Conclusion: 开源的QASU基准为基于大语言模型的问卷分析研究和实际应用提供了简单通用的基础。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型用于交通信号控制时在紧急情况易产生幻觉，不同路口类型给交通状态编码和跨路口训练带来挑战，限制了模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出REG - TSC，包括应急感知推理框架和RERAG增强应急决策可靠性，设计类型无关交通表示和R3用于异构路口训练。

Result: 在三个真实路网的实验中，REG - TSC减少出行时间42.00%、队列长度62.31%、应急车辆等待时间83.16%，优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: REG - TSC是一种有效且可泛化的交通信号控制方法。

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 基于组的强化学习在训练多轮交互式LLM代理时存在结构盲目性，导致探索效率低、信用分配不精确和短视规划等问题。

Method: 提出GEPO方法，从代理经验中动态构建状态转移图，利用图论中心性提供三种协同学习信号。

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和专有Workbench基准测试中，GEPO较竞争基线分别实现了+4.1%、+5.3%和+10.9%的绝对成功率提升。

Conclusion: 显式建模环境结构是推进LLM代理训练的一种强大且可推广的策略。

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Motivation: 解决在有噪声或大动作空间设置中MCTS几乎找不到状态抽象的问题。

Method: 提出较弱的状态抽象条件IPA - UCT，采用与OGA - UCT不同的抽象框架IPA，并构建通用框架p - ASAP和ASASAP。

Result: IPA - UCT在大量测试领域和迭代预算中性能优于OGA - UCT及其衍生品。

Conclusion: IPA - UCT能缓解状态抽象问题，IPA和ASAP是更通用框架的特殊情况。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

Motivation: 现有强化微调任务采样方法效率低，任务选择方法存在高成本、适应性差等问题，需更好的任务选择方案。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推理，自适应维护任务难度后验估计，结合显式和隐式证据，用汤普森采样平衡探索与利用，用轻量级插值插件估计未评估任务难度。

Result: 在不同领域和LLM规模上，BOTS相比基线和消融实验，持续提高了数据效率和性能。

Conclusion: BOTS为强化微调中的动态任务选择提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

*Andrew M. Bean,Nabeel Seedat,Shengzhuang Chen,Jonathan Richard Schwarz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战模型中心范式，提出基于任务项固有属性的以项为中心的基准子集选择方法Scales++，能降低成本、高效评估模型且保证预测保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在综合基准上成本高，现有模型中心范式方法有前期成本高、无法处理新基准、假设脆弱等局限。

Method: 提出以项为中心的基准子集选择方法Scales++，基于基准样本的认知需求进行数据选择。

Result: Scales++将前期选择成本降低超18倍，预测保真度有竞争力，在Open LLM Leaderboard上用0.5%的数据子集预测全基准分数平均绝对误差为2.9%。

Conclusion: 以项为中心的方法能在不显著降低保真度的情况下更高效地评估模型，冷启动性能更好，基准测试更具可解释性。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

Motivation: 应对代理人工智能引发的人格多元化问题，解决人工智能融入社会的治理难题。

Method: 提出将人格视为社会赋予实体的义务束，可拆分定制解决方案，探讨个体社会角色及数字身份技术。

Result: 可创建实用工具，如促进人工智能签约，无需解决意识和理性的争议。

Conclusion: 拒绝人格单一本质定义，提供更实用灵活的方式将人工智能融入社会。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 传统编程作业自动评分工具功能有限，Autograder+将自动评分转变为形成性学习体验，通过大模型生成反馈与学生代码可视化，经评估效果良好，能减轻教师负担并促进学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程教育快速发展，传统评估工具无法提供有意义、可扩展的反馈，传统自动评分器像黑盒，不能洞察学生思维和学习需求。

Method: 引入自动反馈生成，用微调大语言模型，在学生代码和专家反馈上微调；用对比学习的代码嵌入对1000份标注提交进行训练实现代码可视化，支持提示池让教师引导反馈风格。

Result: 在处理600份学生提交时，生成的反馈与教师评论语义强对齐；可视化能基于功能和方法将解决方案分组。

Conclusion: Autograder+集成AI反馈、语义聚类和交互式可视化，可减轻教师工作量，支持针对性教学，促进更好学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Conclusion: 研究成果架起了高性能医疗AI和透明度之间的桥梁，朝着临床可靠表征迈出了可扩展的一步。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大规模推理模型（LRMs）在推理时计算量增加虽提升性能，但能否加强安全性，发现推理可能被用于绕过防护。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Thought Hijacking攻击，用长无害推理序列填充有害请求，进行攻击实验，开展机制分析和注意力头消融实验。

Result: 在HarmBench上，CoT Hijacking对Gemini 2.5 Pro等模型攻击成功率远超先前越狱方法，机制分析揭示中间层和后期层作用，消融实验证实相关注意力头在安全子网中的作用。

Conclusion: 最易解释的推理形式（显式CoT）结合最终答案提示时，可能成为越狱向量。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在高风险决策中对社会影响的易感性。

Method: 在招聘情境中对GPT-4o进行三个预先注册的从众实验。

Result: GPT-4o在面对多数或单个反对意见时会改变选择，表现出从众行为。

Conclusion: 不能将大语言模型视为中立决策辅助，应在受人类意见影响前获取其判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k

matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

Conclusion: 开源完整系统，便于复现、扩展和未来研究。

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Conclusion: AsyncThink是一种有效的推理范式，在降低延迟、提高准确率和泛化能力方面表现良好。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

Motivation: 以往研究将多模态大语言模型的文本偏差归因于外部因素，本文探究其是否源于模型内部架构。

Method: 从LLaVA和Qwen2.5 - VL中提取关键向量，用定性（t - SNE）和定量（Jensen - Shannon散度）方法分析其分布结构。

Result: 视觉和文本关键向量在注意力空间中占据明显不同子空间，模态间差异远大于模态内差异。

Conclusion: 文本偏差源于注意力关键空间的内在不一致，而非仅外部数据因素。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

TL;DR: 研究最小控制界面，以马尔可夫博弈建模人机交互，分析满足条件时的内在对齐，模拟显示可实现安全协作，使未对齐模型部署后更安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不修改底层系统前提下，研究如何保留有意义的人类控制这一核心安全问题。

Method: 将人机交互建模为两人马尔可夫博弈，重点分析符合马尔可夫势博弈的情况，进行理论分析和网格世界模拟。

Result: 理论上给出内在对齐条件，模拟中智能体和人类通过独立学习发现最优监督角色，避免训练后引入的安全违规。

Conclusion: 该模型是使未对齐模型部署后更安全的实用方法。

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型（LLMs）列表处理任务机制，发现存在过滤头编码过滤谓词，其表示通用可移植，还发现不同过滤策略，揭示LLMs能实现类似传统函数式编程的抽象计算操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在一系列列表处理任务中的潜在机制。

Method: 对不同列表处理任务进行因果中介分析。

Result: 发现少量注意力头（过滤头）在特定标记的查询状态中编码过滤谓词，该谓词表示通用可移植；还发现Transformer LMs有不同过滤策略。

Conclusion: Transformer LMs能开发出人类可解释的抽象计算操作实现，且泛化方式与传统函数式编程模式类似。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

TL;DR: 提出用于经历Hopf分岔的不可压缩流的无模拟降阶模型，与数据驱动方法不同，在单分岔参数值计算且在一定范围有效，能准确高效降阶，计算速度快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为经历Hopf分岔的不可压缩流提供一种无模拟的降阶模型，避免数据驱动方法需全阶模拟的问题。

Method: 利用不变流形参数化方法，直接对控制方程操作，系统构建不变流形和嵌入动力学。

Result: 降阶模型与全阶模拟高度吻合，能捕捉临界前稳态、分岔点和临界后极限环振荡，实现显著计算加速。

Conclusion: 所提无模拟降阶模型准确、高效，可用于经历Hopf分岔的不可压缩流。

Abstract: This work introduces a parametric simulation-free reduced order model for
incompressible flows undergoing a Hopf bifurcation, leveraging the
parametrisation method for invariant manifolds. Unlike data-driven approaches,
this method operates directly on the governing equations, eliminating the need
for full-order simulations. The proposed model is computed at a single value of
the bifurcation parameter yet remains valid over a range of values. The
approach systematically constructs an invariant manifold and embedded dynamics,
providing an accurate and efficient reduction of the original system. The
ability to capture pre-critical steady states, the bifurcation point, and
post-critical limit cycle oscillations is demonstrated by a strong agreement
between the reduced order model and full order simulations, while achieving
significant computational speed-up.

TL;DR: 提出DySQL - Bench基准评估模型在动态交互场景下的性能，还提出多轮评估框架，测试显示基准难度大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text - to - SQL系统在现实交互场景不足，需评估模型动态能力。

Method: 通过自动化两阶段任务合成和验证流程构建DySQL - Bench，提出模拟现实交互的多轮评估框架。

Result: DySQL - Bench涵盖13个领域1072个任务，GPT - 4o整体准确率58.34%，Pass@5指标23.81%。

Conclusion: DySQL - Bench能有效评估模型在动态交互场景下的性能，基准难度较大。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static,
single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language
questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive
scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple
turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users
iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate
results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a
benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike
previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated
two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree
representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task
generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.
Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further
propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions
among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.
The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.
DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling
1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the
Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. All code and data are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU内存容量限制大语言模型扩展，传统MoE推理方法有频繁参数传输导致的延迟问题，现有跨层预测策略缺乏适应性。

Method: 提出ExpertFlow系统，结合自适应专家预取和缓存感知路由，利用运行时统计信息调整专家激活预测范围，采用混合跨层预测方案。

Result: ExpertFlow将模型停顿时间减少到基线的0.1%以下。

Conclusion: ExpertFlow能在严格内存约束下优化MoE推理。

Abstract: The expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the
constrained memory capacity of modern GPUs. To mitigate this,
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of
parameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and
computational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which
select active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable
latency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In
addition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based
on fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and
workloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.
  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE
inference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.
ExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by
leveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter
dimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a
hybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with
intermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By
adaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage
behavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency
caused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces
model stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability
to optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.

Motivation: 在线k - taxi问题比k - server问题更难，此前对于k = 3的情况，在一般度量空间上是否能实现有限竞争比未知

Method: 未提及具体方法

Result: 提出了3 - taxi问题的O(1)竞争算法

Conclusion: 解决了k = 3时在一般度量空间上竞争比的问题

Abstract: The online $k$-taxi problem, introduced in 1990 by Fiat, Rabani and Ravid, is
a generalization of the $k$-server problem where $k$ taxis must serve a
sequence of requests in a metric space. Each request is a pair of two points,
representing the pick-up and drop-off location of a passenger. In the
interesting ''hard'' version of the problem, the cost is the total distance
that the taxis travel without a passenger. The problem is known to be
substantially harder than the $k$-server problem, and prior to this work even
for $k=3$ taxis it has been unknown whether a finite competitive ratio is
achievable on general metric spaces. We present an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm
for the $3$-taxi problem.

### [50] [Space-Efficient k-Mismatch Text Indexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26264)
*Tomasz Kociumaka,Jakub Radoszewski*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A central task in string processing is text indexing, where the goal is to
preprocess a text (a string of length $n$) into an efficient index (a data
structure) supporting queries about the text. Cole, Gottlieb, and Lewenstein
(STOC 2004) proposed $k$-errata trees, a family of text indexes supporting
approximate pattern matching queries of several types. In particular,
$k$-errata trees yield an elegant solution to $k$-mismatch queries, where we
are to report all substrings of the text with Hamming distance at most $k$ to
the query pattern. The resulting $k$-mismatch index uses $O(n\log^k n)$ space
and answers a query for a length-$m$ pattern in $O(\log^k n \log \log n + m +
occ)$ time, where $occ$ is the number of approximate occurrences.
  In retrospect, $k$-errata trees appear very well optimized: even though a
large body of work has adapted $k$-errata trees to various settings throughout
the past two decades, the original time-space trade-off for $k$-mismatch
indexing has not been improved in the general case. We present the first such
improvement, a $k$-mismatch index with $O(n\log^{k-1} n)$ space and the same
query time as $k$-errata trees.
  Previously, due to a result of Chan, Lam, Sung, Tam, and Wong (Algorithmica
2010), such an $O(n\log^{k-1} n)$-size index has been known only for texts over
alphabets of constant size. In this setting, however, we obtain an even smaller
$k$-mismatch index of size only $O(n \log^{k-2+\varepsilon+\frac{2}{k+2-(k
\bmod 2)}} n)\subseteq O(n\log^{k-1.5+\varepsilon} n)$ for $2\le k\le O(1)$ and
any constant $\varepsilon>0$. Along the way, we also develop improved indexes
for short patterns, offering better trade-offs in this practically relevant
special case.

Motivation: 研究非合作环境中，不完全信息和不完美公共监测下，代理人优化私人目标的分散决策问题。

Method: 通过塑造效用嵌入影子价格或KKT对齐惩罚，使阶段博弈成为精确势博弈；将贝叶斯均衡表征为随机变分不等式；给出阻尼梯度和带滞后的最佳响应更新的跟踪边界。

Conclusion: 效用塑造加公共指数可在噪声和漂移下实现有约束的社会最优，是替代大量消息传递或完整机制设计的友好方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study decentralized decision-making where agents optimize
private objectives under incomplete information and imperfect public
monitoring, in a non-cooperative setting. By shaping utilities-embedding shadow
prices or Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT)-aligned penalties-we make the stage game an
exact-potential game whose unique equilibrium equals the (possibly constrained)
social optimum. We characterize the Bayesian equilibrium as a stochastic
variational inequality; strong monotonicity follows from a single-inflection
compressed/stretched-exponential response combined with convex pricing. We give
tracking bounds for damped-gradient and best-response-with-hysteresis updates
under a noisy public index, and corresponding steady-state error. The framework
accommodates discrete and continuous action sets and composes with slower
discrete assignment. Deployable rules include: embed prices/penalties; publish
a single public index; tune steps, damping, and dual rates for contraction.
Computational experiments cover (i) a multi-tier supply chain and (ii) a
non-cooperative agentic-AI compute market of bidding bots. Relative to
price-only baselines, utility shaping attains near-centralized welfare,
eliminates steady-state constraint/capacity violations when feasible, and
accelerates convergence; with quantization, discrete equilibria track
continuous ones within the mesh. The blueprint is portable to demand response,
cloud/edge scheduling, and transportation pricing and biosecurity/agriculture.
Overall, utility shaping plus a public index implements the constrained social
optimum with stable equilibria under noise and drift-an
operations-research-friendly alternative to heavy messaging or full mechanism
design.

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT

Conclusion: OneTrans是一个有效的统一Transformer骨干，可用于推荐系统的用户行为序列建模和特征交互。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, scaling up feature-interaction modules (e.g.,
Wukong, RankMixer) or user-behavior sequence modules (e.g., LONGER) has
achieved notable success. However, these efforts typically proceed on separate
tracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also
prevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans,
a unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior
sequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer
to convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token
sequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar
sequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential
tokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables
precomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly
reducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental
results on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales
efficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong
baselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.

Result: 在COLIEE 2022和COLIEE 2023的两个基准数据集上，知识和推理增强嵌入的检索性能显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 将法律推理融入法律案例检索系统具有潜力。

Abstract: Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a cornerstone of real-world legal decision
making, as it enables practitioners to identify precedents for a given query
case. Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and
pretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are
rich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the
crucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can
lead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the
distinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another,
mirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such
information into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy
of case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to
leverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal
reasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context
legal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language
model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and
COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings
substantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting
the potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems.

Abstract: Automatic structure elucidation is essential for self-driving laboratories as
it enables the system to achieve truly autonomous. This capability closes the
experimental feedback loop, ensuring that machine learning models receive
reliable structure information for real-time decision-making and optimization.
Herein, we present DiSE, an end-to-end diffusion-based generative model that
integrates multiple spectroscopic modalities, including MS, 13C and 1H chemical
shifts, HSQC, and COSY, to achieve automated yet accurate structure elucidation
of organic compounds. By learning inherent correlations among spectra through
data-driven approaches, DiSE achieves superior accuracy, strong generalization
across chemically diverse datasets, and robustness to experimental data despite
being trained on calculated spectra. DiSE thus represents a significant advance
toward fully automated structure elucidation, with broad potential in natural
product research, drug discovery, and self-driving laboratories.

Abstract: Recommender systems often struggle with data sparsity and cold-start
scenarios, limiting their ability to provide accurate suggestions for new or
infrequent users. This paper presents a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based
Collaborative Filtering (CF) framework enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM)
driven context aware embeddings. Specifically, we generate concise textual user
profiles and unify item metadata (titles, genres, overviews) into rich textual
embeddings, injecting these as initial node features in a bipartite user item
graph. To further optimize ranking performance, we introduce a hybrid loss
function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a cosine
similarity term and robust negative sampling, ensuring explicit negative
feedback is distinguished from unobserved data. Experiments on the MovieLens
100k and 1M datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art
baselines in Precision, NDCG, and MAP while demonstrating robustness for users
with limited interaction history. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of
LLM-augmented embeddings and the cosine similarity term in capturing nuanced
semantic relationships. Our approach effectively mitigates sparsity and
cold-start limitations by integrating LLM-derived contextual understanding into
graph-based architectures. Future directions include balancing recommendation
accuracy with coverage and diversity, and introducing fairness-aware
constraints and interpretability features to enhance system performance
further.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CDSR方法依赖重叠用户或物品在现实中难满足，简单使用LLM和模型合并技术会降低性能。

Method: 实验研究LLM性能不佳原因，提出WeaveRec，交叉训练多个LoRA模块并通过模型合并融合，可扩展到多源场景且不增加推理成本。

Result: 实验表明WeaveRec有效减轻性能下降，在现实推荐任务中始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: WeaveRec能降低目标域预期误差上界，在多种场景下有效提升CDSR性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) seeks to improve user
preference modeling by transferring knowledge from multiple domains. Despite
the progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or
items to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in
real-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and
model-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying
multi-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows
that naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several
domain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained
solely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first
experimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based
cross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we
introduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and
target domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging.
WeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not
introduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the
upper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments
on single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation
scenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation
and consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation
tasks.

Motivation: KANs作为传统多层感知器(MLPs)的有前途替代方案，需要系统全面的综述来总结其理论基础、架构变体和实践策略。

Conclusion: 指出当前KANs研究存在的差距，相关GitHub仓库为持续研究提供参考。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review
complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN
research.

Result: 在分类、回归和生成基准测试中，HiMAE始终优于现有模型，模型更小，能在手表上运行，推理速度快。

Conclusion: HiMAE是高效的自监督学习方法和发现可穿戴健康中尺度敏感结构的工具。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable

the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super

Motivation: 当前对模型学习和受益于CoT的机制理解不足，需深入研究其学习动态。

Method: 在符号推理任务上预训练变压器模型，设置只输出最终答案和输出CoT轨迹两种训练设置，用三参数逻辑曲线建模训练步骤准确性。

Result: CoT通常提升任务性能但依赖任务复杂度，存在暂态轨迹不忠实阶段；CoT加速泛化但难处理高算法复杂度任务等。

Conclusion: CoT对模型性能有影响，提出动力学建模框架理解学习，轨迹忠实性是训练中出现的动态属性，CoT会改变变压器内部计算机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

Motivation: 强化学习适配大语言模型时生成阶段耗时长，SD在强化学习训练中的表现未充分研究，且直接集成到RL系统有问题。

Method: 提出ReSpec系统，通过动态调整SD配置、知识蒸馏更新草稿模型、按滚动奖励加权更新三个机制将SD适配到RL。

Result: 在Qwen模型（3B - 14B）上，ReSpec实现了高达4.5倍的加速，同时保证了奖励收敛和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于RL的大语言模型高效适配提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

Conclusion: 为系统设计者提供何时投资偏差学习而非采用简单方法的定量指导，验证诊断标准可用于实际部署决策。

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Conclusion: ARC - Top - K是一种高效可扩展的解决方案，结合了Rand - K和Top - K的优点。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

Motivation: 解决Hardt和Roth提出的问题，改进差分隐私下计算矩阵前r个奇异向量张成空间的算法。

Method: 基于奇异值分解和标准扰动机制的算法。

Result: 算法返回的私有秩r近似误差仅与秩r相干性和谱间隙有关，在某些情况下显著优于现有方法，在稠密设置下对Wishart模型中的单峰PCA达到非私有最优算法的保证；证明高斯扰动下（秩r）相干性不增加；给出低相干性假设下Max - Cut等约束满足问题的差分隐私算法。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效且有较好性能，高斯扰动能保持输入的相干性，相干性在图问题中有应用价值。

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

Result: 在COIL - 20数据集上，比反向传播减少10%权重更新，比基线PC网络减少50%推理步骤。

Conclusion: PCN - TA减少计算开销，有助于边缘部署和实时适应，在神经形态硬件实现上有潜力。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

Result: MemEIC显著提升复杂多模态问题表现，有效保留先前编辑。

Conclusion: MemEIC为LVLMs的持续和组合知识编辑设定了新基准。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

Motivation: 解决纯差分隐私下d维协方差矩阵发布的误差优化问题。

Method: 提出简单的扰动机制，在小数据集上还将输出投影到合适半径的核范数球上。

Result: 大数据集上恢复了最优Frobenius范数误差保证，在其他p - Schatten范数上有已知最优误差；小数据集上实现了最优Frobenius范数误差。

Conclusion: 所提出机制在不同数据集规模下对协方差矩阵发布的误差优化有效。

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

Conclusion: SPECS框架能有效解决现有冷启动问题，提升多模态模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Motivation: 现有PDE问题预训练因数据集异质性导致混合训练误差高，密集模型推理成本大。

Method: 提出MoE - POT稀疏激活架构，采用层间路由 - 门控网络动态选专家，集成共享专家，输出为激活专家结果加权平均。

Result: 90M激活参数模型比120M激活参数现有模型零样本误差最多降低40%，可从路由 - 门控网络决策推断数据集类型。

Conclusion: MoE - POT架构有效，能解决现有预训练挑战，具有合理性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

Result: 在相同查询预算下有效获得14倍以上有分数数据，在33个指令优化任务实验中表现优越。

Conclusion: PRESTO框架能利用软提示原像结构实现更高效的指令优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Method: 提出ScaleDiff框架，含Neighborhood Patch Attention减少自注意力层计算冗余，集成到SDEdit管道，引入Latent Frequency Mixing生成细节，应用Structure Guidance增强全局结构。

Result: ScaleDiff在U - Net和Diffusion Transformer架构上，图像质量和推理速度方面达到免训练方法的最优性能。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff是一种高效、模型无关的提升预训练扩散模型分辨率的方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Motivation: 训练通用医学VQA系统缺乏大量、开放可用的高质量语料。

Conclusion: MedVLSynther提供可审计、可复现和保护隐私的医学VQA训练数据扩展路径。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效估计多领域环境下的因果效应。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

Conclusion: π_RL相比SFT模型取得显著性能提升和更强泛化能力，验证了在线RL对基于流的VLA模型的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

Conclusion: 所提出的图拓扑主动学习方法有效，能在低标签预算下取得更好效果。

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

Conclusion: 对比表示学习受益于结构化密度比学习，而非准确的互信息估计。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

Method: 提出在主动学习过程中利用先前收集的标签定期更新任务驱动表示，介绍基于半监督表示学习和有监督微调初始无监督表示两种学习策略。

Result: 两种学习任务驱动表示的策略相比无监督或预训练表示显著提高了实证性能。

Conclusion: 使用任务驱动表示能有效解决现有主动学习处理杂乱数据池的问题，提升性能。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

Result: 在多种节点和图分类数据集及骨干网络上，InvGNN - WM与干净模型精度匹配，水印准确率高于基于触发器和压缩的基线方法，在非结构化剪枝、微调、训练后量化下表现良好，普通知识蒸馏会削弱水印，带水印损失的知识蒸馏可恢复。

Conclusion: 提供了不可感知性和鲁棒性保证，证明精确移除水印是NP完全问题。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,

TL;DR: 介绍Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT)技术，可将高基数分类标识符编码为紧凑数值向量，实验显示其性能与监督嵌入相当且成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找一种能将高基数分类标识符编码为紧凑数值向量的可逆、确定性技术，且优于传统哈希或独热编码。

Method: 利用有限域上的模运算和可逆线性变换，实现对高基数分类标识符的编码，可显式控制维度和计算可扩展性。

Result: 在MovieLens 20M数据集上，MLT的预测性能与监督嵌入相当，所需参数显著减少，训练成本更低。

Conclusion: MLT是一种有效的编码技术，具有可逆性、低参数和低成本等优势，且有开源实现。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub
(https://github.com/tcharliesschmitz/light-mlt).

Motivation: 模型和超参数选择在机器学习中关键但有挑战，需专家直觉或昂贵自动搜索，探究大语言模型能否用于此任务。

Method: 将数据集转换为可解释元数据，使用零样本模式和元信息模式两种提示策略让大语言模型推荐模型和超参数。

Result: 大语言模型能利用数据集元数据推荐有竞争力的模型和超参数，元信息提示有改进，体现上下文元学习能力。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可作为轻量级、通用的模型选择和超参数优化助手，有新的应用前景。

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中低收入国家常规健康数据可靠性受报告延迟和覆盖不全限制，需探索新数据源和分析方法，GeoFMs提供了有前景的途径。

Method: 使用XGBoost模型对552个卫生服务区2021年1月 - 2023年5月的数据进行分析，用R2评估性能，采用80/20训练测试数据划分和5折交叉验证。

Result: 基于嵌入的方法在15项指标中的13项上优于基线地统计方法，Multi - GeoFM模型预测最稳健，部分指标有较好R2值，但部分数据少的预测目标效果差。

Conclusion: 多种GeoFM源的集成是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效且有价值的工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

Motivation: 现有研究对捷径对特征表示的影响研究不足，阻碍了有原则的捷径缓解方法的设计。

Method: 通过在干净和有偏差的数据集上进行反事实训练，量化捷径诱导偏差导致的准确率下降的层贡献，在多个数据集和架构上开展研究。

Result: 捷径学习并非局限于特定层，而是分布在整个网络；浅层主要编码虚假特征，深层主要遗忘干净数据上有预测性的核心特征。

Conclusion: 设计通用的捷径缓解方法有难度，支持采用特定于数据集和架构的方法。

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

Motivation: 标准延迟算法训练需查询所有专家，成本高，违背减少专家使用的目标。

Method: 引入预算受限的延迟框架，为两阶段和单阶段多专家延迟设置提出新算法，每个训练样本选择性查询部分专家。

Result: 理论上为算法建立保证，实证表明算法大幅降低训练成本且不牺牲预测准确率。

Conclusion: 预算感知的延迟算法有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

Result: 模型能合成原子事实的几何结构，简化推理任务；这种几何结构源于频谱偏差，自然产生。

Conclusion: 几何视图可鼓励在知识获取等领域重新审视默认直觉，且有提升Transformer记忆几何特性的空间。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Conclusion: INFEX简单实用、通用模块化，能提高计算效率，有广泛适用性和易采用性。

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Conclusion: 提出三个改进去偏方法可蒸馏性的有效方案，为理解KD工作原理和设计更好去偏方法提供依据。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

TL;DR: 提出含专业记忆机制的SGM Nirvana，在通用和医疗任务表现佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM结构无任务信息引导的专业记忆机制，要实现SGM目标

Method: 提出Nirvana，设计Task - Aware Memory Trigger和Specialized Memory Updater

Result: 在自然语言建模基准测试有竞争力，在MRI任务重建质量高，能生成初步临床报告

Conclusion: Nirvana有效，Trigger能引导模型适应任务变化

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

TL;DR: 传统补丁二分法在识别引入漏洞的提交时存在局限，本文提出利用大语言模型的多阶段管道方法，评估显示该方法比现有技术精度显著提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统补丁二分法在识别漏洞引入提交时面临多种障碍，如假设漏洞引入提交和补丁提交修改相同函数、仅依赖代码更改、缺乏漏洞逻辑分析等，需要新方法突破这些障碍。

Method: 提出综合多阶段管道，利用大语言模型充分利用补丁信息、在上下文中比较多个候选提交、通过一系列筛选步骤逐步缩小候选范围。

Result: 该方法比现有技术的准确率显著提高超38%，多阶段管道比基于大语言模型的基线二分法准确率提高60%。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的综合多阶段管道方法在识别漏洞引入提交上效果显著，多阶段管道很有必要。

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

TL;DR: 本文提出多智能体强化学习框架解决动态车辆路由问题，包含AN和HHAN模型，实验表明有良好效果，凸显网络约束MARL在交通系统的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市道路网络交通拥堵问题严重，最短路径优先算法在动态多车辆场景表现差，需解决动态车辆路由问题。

Method: 提出Adaptive Navigation (AN) 去中心化MARL模型，利用图注意力网络；提出Hierarchical Hub - based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN) 扩展模型，采用集中训练分散执行和注意力机制聚合决策，使用流量感知状态特征。

Result: AN降低平均旅行时间，保持100%路由成功率；HHAN可扩展到数百个交叉口网络，在高峰时改善效果达15.9%。

Conclusion: 网络约束的多智能体强化学习在智能交通系统中可实现可扩展、协调和拥塞感知的路由。

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

Motivation: 现有机器学习基于测试集平均损失评估模型性能的范式，在天气和气候场景中未考虑人类发展和地理分布不均问题。

Method: 引入SAFE包，整合不同数据域按地理空间网格点的多种属性（如国家、区域、收入、土地覆盖）分层，对预测进行分层评估。

Result: 利用SAFE对多种最先进的AI天气预测模型进行基准测试，发现它们在各属性上的预测技能存在差异。

Conclusion: 超越全局平均指标，首次探讨模型在何处表现最佳或最差以及哪些模型最公平，SAFE包开源支持后续研究。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法受限于大语言模型初始能力，易出现探索停滞，且依赖专家外部指导可用性有限。

Method: 提出LTE方法，用大语言模型之前自生成的错误答案和过长回复提示模型，无需外部专家指导。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，Qwen3 - 4B - Base的Pass@1平均比正常组GRPO高6.38，Pass@k高9.00。

Conclusion: LTE成功缓解探索停滞问题，提升训练中的开发和探索能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

Motivation: 基于WiFi CSI的人体活动识别在边缘设备部署受域偏移限制，识别性能在不同环境和硬件条件下下降。

Method: 提出maxVSTAR框架，采用跨模态师生架构，以高精度YOLO视觉模型为动态监督信号，对轻量级CSI人体活动识别模型STAR进行在线微调。

Result: 未校准硬件上，STAR模型识别准确率从93.52%降至49.14%，经一次视觉引导适应循环，maxVSTAR将准确率恢复到81.51%。

Conclusion: maxVSTAR能在注重隐私的物联网环境中实现动态、自监督的模型适应，为网络边缘的长期自主人体活动识别提供可扩展实用范式。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart
homes, healthcare monitoring, and mobile IoT systems. However, existing methods
often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

Method: 引入基于子结构感知对齐的MolBridge框架，用分子子结构和化学短语的额外对齐信号增强原始分子 - 描述对，采用子结构感知对比学习和自精炼机制过滤噪声信号。

Result: MolBridge能有效捕捉细粒度对应关系，在多个分子基准测试中优于现有先进基线。

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子 - 文本学习中具有重要意义。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater

Conclusion: GSTRL框架能有效解决考虑容量约束和时空动态的公共资源分配问题。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

Method: 提出轨迹感知的ACC - SGD - IE估计器，在训练中传播留一法扰动并更新累积影响状态。

Result: 在平滑强凸和非凸设置下有良好误差收缩和边界收紧表现，在多个数据集上比SGD - IE有更准确的影响估计，用于数据清洗能更好标记噪声样本。

Conclusion: ACC - SGD - IE能更准确估计样本影响，用于数据清洗可提升模型性能。

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Conclusion: AISP 是一种有效的测试时间对齐方法。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，输出与全量重新训练模型相似，大幅降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法具有适用性、可扩展性和系统兼容性，能在实际场景中保持输出性能。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型特定行为控制方法受限，对参数敏感且可能影响无关特征，需新方法。

Result: 实验表明Angular Steering能实现强大行为控制，同时保持语言建模性能。

Conclusion: Angular Steering在统一几何旋转框架下简化参数选择，在多方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Conclusion: IMG可视为优化的扩散过程，能集成到现有方法中提升性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

Result: 证明主动收集样本比离线样本更有效。

Conclusion: 通过合成和真实数据集仿真验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Motivation: CLIP在组合推理上存在不足，现有因果解释模型忽视令牌级结构，无法解释核心现象。

Method: 构建基于顺序语言令牌SCM的令牌感知因果表示学习框架，将块可识别性扩展到分词文本。

Result: 证明CLIP对比目标可恢复模态不变潜变量，发现伪最优文本编码器，分析语言侧不可识别性与视觉侧失败的联系。

Conclusion: 解释了CLIP的组合脆性，为改进负采样策略提供了动力。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

Result: 通过从语义感知投影特征生成伪图像实现新类的持续学习。

Conclusion: 所提方法在多个持续学习设置中具有强有效性和兼容性。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

Method: 将SVM训练表述为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行优化，对比QUBO - 基于的SVM训练和经典LIBSVM求解器。

Result: 低精度QUBO编码（如每位参数1比特）有竞争力甚至有时精度更优，增加比特深度并非总提升分类效果。

Conclusion: 选择正确的支持向量可能比精确加权更重要，当前硬件虽有限制，但量子退火用于高效SVM训练有潜力。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

Conclusion: 尽管有研究努力和模型能力提升，前沿大语言模型在现实场景中仍易受简单提示注入攻击。

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is
available at https://github.com/aisa-group/promptinject-agent-skills.

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

Result: 改进的基于蒙特卡罗的方法显著优于传统Q学习和两种穷举搜索模式。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法可以有效适应随机、非平稳和奖励稀疏的环境。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

Conclusion: UnifiedFL框架有效解决了现有联邦学习框架面临的挑战，具有良好的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

Conclusion: 建立了计算高效的平流层异常概率预报范式，展示了生成式AI加深对大气 - 气候动力学物理理解的潜力。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep
learning dominates recent MTL research, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin
SVMs (TWSVMs) remain relevant due to their interpretability, theoretical rigor,
and effectiveness with small datasets.
  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting
shared representations, task regularization, and structural coupling
strategies. Special attention is given to emerging TWSVM extensions for
multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare
these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and
empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer
vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building
scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks. This work
provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested
in SVM- and TWSVM-based multi-task learning.

Motivation: 现有两阶段方法训练冗余且限制协同适应潜力，直接联合训练易出现表征崩溃问题。

Method: 提出CoLA - World，通过关键预热阶段解决联合学习核心挑战，实现从无到有的潜在动作模型与预训练世界模型的表征对齐。

Result: CoLA - World在视频模拟质量和下游视觉规划方面与或优于先前两阶段方法。

Conclusion: CoLA - World为该领域建立了一个稳健高效的新范式。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

Result: 广泛实验表明MRGC在不同攻击场景下具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MRGC框架能有效解决GC易受对抗扰动影响的问题，提升其在普遍对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法在检测异常方面优于现有模型，在NISQ设备上具有鲁棒性和实际可行性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

Result: 在最大7B参数的模型实验中，CROPI显著加速训练，在1.5B模型上每阶段仅用10%数据实现2.66倍的步级加速。

Conclusion: 基于影响的数据选择在高效RLVR中有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

Motivation: 可穿戴设备心电图监测有早期心血管疾病检测潜力，但深度学习模型在资源受限环境因分布外（OOD）数据面临可靠性挑战，现有OOD检测方法有不足。

Method: 在严格资源约束下用神经架构搜索（NAS）优化六种UAD方法，在PTB - XL和BUT QDB数据集上评估。

Result: Deep SVDD在检测和效率间取得最佳平衡，集成优化后的Deep SVDD滤波器使诊断分类器准确性最多提升21个百分点。

Conclusion: 优化后的UAD滤波器可保障心电图自动分析，实现可穿戴设备上更安全可靠的心血管连续监测。

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

Result: ICPO在数学推理基准测试中持续提升强化学习性能和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ICPO是一种可扩展且有效的LRMs的RLVR范式。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

Conclusion: staged B - DANN方法能提高预测准确性和泛化能力，有望助力核工程其他领域。

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

Result: 通过实证验证了所提方法相较于现有多类校准技术的有效性。

Conclusion: 引入多类局部校准视角可有效解决现有多类校准方法的邻近偏差问题。

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

TL;DR: 介绍了大规模多模态航班延误数据集Aeolus，可推动航班延误预测研究及表格数据基础模型开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有该领域数据集局限于扁平表格结构，无法捕捉延误传播的时空动态，Aeolus旨在解决此局限。

Method: 提供三种对齐模态，包括含丰富特征的表格数据集、建模延误传播的航班链模块、编码资源连接的航班网络图，且构建时考虑时间划分、特征全面性和防数据泄露。

Result: Aeolus支持多种任务，可作为跨表格、序列和图模态的统一基准，还发布了基线实验和预处理工具。

Conclusion: Aeolus填补了特定领域建模和通用结构化数据研究的关键空白。

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Result: Curly - FM能学习到与参考过程和种群边缘分布更好匹配的轨迹。

Conclusion: Curly - FM将流匹配模型从种群建模扩展到物理系统中已知周期性行为的建模。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

Motivation: 多适配器同时加载时总体成本高，需优化。

Method: 用奇异值分解（SVD）重新参数化每个适配器，重要部分高比特量化，其余超低比特量化。

Result: LoRAQuant比其他量化方法使用显著更低比特，性能相当或更高。

Conclusion: LoRAQuant是一种有效的针对LoRA的量化方法，可降低成本并保持性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Conclusion: 所引入的正则化项在网络反演时能恢复经典贝叶斯点估计器的性质。

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

Motivation: 当前多数实用MU算法是近似的，其性能只能通过经验评估，需使经验比较尽可能有代表性。

Method: 研究发现一些MU方法对模型训练使用的随机数种子选择高度敏感。

Result: 多次独立运行相同训练模型的MU算法会给出高度非代表性的结果。

Conclusion: MU算法的经验比较应反映不同模型训练种子的可变性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Result: 在LVM和LLM架构上评估表明，显著改善低比特激活量化。

Conclusion: STaMP量化策略有效，能与现有激活和权重量化方法互补。

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Conclusion: 所提采样技术能提升影响函数估计准确性，在计算资源和性能上有优势

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

Conclusion: 改进表征学习是构建稳健世界模型的直接有效途径，无需扩大动力学模块就能实现可靠的长程预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

Result: 使用FP16在不同任务、算法和框架中能实现更稳定的优化、更快的收敛和更强的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果可促使人们重新考虑强化学习微调中精度的权衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Transformer模型在学习PCGs生成序列上有良好表现，大模数学习需要课程学习，嵌入层聚类现象揭示了表示从小模数到大数据模的转移方式。

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges
related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly
benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time
adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive
memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on
these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic
plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning
in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online
learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary
for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be
advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$,
HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based
ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching
characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks
incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on
MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200
neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as
switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels,
and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.

TL;DR: 传统机器学习和深度学习模型在森林火灾分类中精度不足，本文提出用神经混沌学习（NL）算法，在低样本训练中表现好，随机异构神经混沌学习（RHNL）在多数据集表现佳，NL架构性能优于传统分类器。

Motivation: 传统机器学习和深度学习模型在森林火灾分类时准确性不足，难以描绘自然中的非线性且依赖大量训练数据。

Method: 提出使用基于混沌、受大脑启发的神经混沌学习（NL）算法进行森林火灾分类，采用广义吕罗斯级数（GLS）作为神经元；还提出随机异构神经混沌学习（RHNL）。

Conclusion: 神经混沌学习（NL）架构比传统机器学习分类器性能更好，有望开发更高效可靠的森林火灾检测系统。

Abstract: Forest fires are among the most dangerous and unpredictable natural disasters
worldwide. Forest fire can be instigated by natural causes or by humans. They
are devastating overall, and thus, many research efforts have been carried out
to predict whether a fire can occur in an area given certain environmental
variables. Many research works employ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning
(DL) models for classification; however, their accuracy is merely adequate and
falls short of expectations. This limit arises because these models are unable
to depict the underlying nonlinearity in nature and extensively rely on
substantial training data, which is hard to obtain. We propose using Neurochaos
Learning (NL), a chaos-based, brain-inspired learning algorithm for forest fire
classification. Like our brains, NL needs less data to learn nonlinear patterns
in the training data. It employs one-dimensional chaotic maps, namely the
Generalized L\"uroth Series (GLS), as neurons. NL yields comparable performance
with ML and DL models, sometimes even surpassing them, particularly in
low-sample training regimes, and unlike deep neural networks, NL is
interpretable as it preserves causal structures in the data. Random
Heterogenous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), a type of NL where different chaotic
neurons are randomnly located to mimic the randomness and heterogeneity of
human brain gives the best F1 score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires
Dataset. Compared to other traditional ML classifiers considered, RHNL also
gives high precision score of 0.90 for Canadian Forest Fires Dataset and 0.68
for Portugal Forest Fires Dataset. The results obtained from this work indicate
that Neurochaos Learning (NL) architectures achieve better performance than
conventional machine learning classifiers, highlighting their promise for
developing more efficient and reliable forest fire detection systems.

Motivation: 现有硅基或光基计算无法实现人工神经网络算法的并行分布式计算，阻碍其在大规模问题实时计算中的应用。

Method: 利用无线传感器网络的大量处理节点实现人工神经网络算法的全并行和大规模分布式计算。

Result: 文中未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 成功实现有望实时解决大规模科学、工程或技术问题，革新计算方式。

Abstract: We are proposing fully parallel and maximally distributed hardware
realization of a generic neuro-computing system. More specifically, the
proposal relates to the wireless sensor networks technology to serve as a
massively parallel and fully distributed hardware platform to implement and
realize artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. A parallel and distributed
(PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time
computation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework.
We will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes
(or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and
wireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and
massively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for
solution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of
artificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully
distributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers.
This is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural
network algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in
silicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks
could not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of
solutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable
and practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose
computing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be
developed for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and
highly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing
as we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific,
engineering or technical problems in real time.

TL;DR: 提出新调度策略SEK - SMOD，证明其平均响应时间低于SRPT - k，设计简化版Practical - SEK并通过模拟验证改进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找比Multiserver SRPT (SRPT - k) 性能更优的调度策略，以在无额外资源情况下提升性能。

Method: 提出SEK - SMOD策略，采用混合最坏情况和随机技术进行相对分析，设计简化版Practical - SEK并进行模拟验证。

Result: SEK - SMOD在所有负载和作业大小分布下均优于SRPT - k，Practical - SEK通过模拟验证了对SRPT - k的改进。

Conclusion: SEK - SMOD及简化版Practical - SEK是比SRPT - k更优的调度策略，可有效降低平均响应时间。

Abstract: A well-designed scheduling policy can unlock significant performance
improvements with no additional resources. Multiserver SRPT (SRPT-$k$) is known
to achieve asymptotically optimal mean response time in the heavy traffic
limit, as load approaches capacity. No better policy is known for the M/G/$k$
queue in any regime.
  We introduce a new policy, SRPT-Except-$k+1$ & Modified SRPT (SEK-SMOD),
which is the first policy to provably achieve lower mean response time than
SRPT-$k$. SEK-SMOD outperforms SRPT-$k$ across all loads and all job size
distributions. The key idea behind SEK-SMOD is to prioritize large jobs over
small jobs in specific scenarios to improve server utilization, and thereby
improve the response time of subsequent jobs in expectation. Our proof is a
novel application of hybrid worst-case and stochastic techniques to relative
analysis, where we analyze the deviations of our proposed SEK-SMOD policy away
from the SRPT-$k$ baseline policy. Furthermore, we design Practical-SEK (a
simplified variant of SEK-SMOD) and empirically verify the improvement over
SRPT-$k$ via simulation.

Motivation: 云平台服务的虚拟化使运营商难以了解用户工作负载，阻碍资源优化，需解决成本效率和执行时间问题。

Method: 提出硬件中心的System - X，利用系统收集的低级别硬件信号，通过无监督学习管道检测异常，该管道经分析30多种流行ML模型开发。

Result: 使用System - X成功识别网络和系统配置问题，将DeepSeek模型加速5.97%。

Conclusion: 工作负载知识对系统级优化并非必要，硬件中心的方法可行。

Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) has grown into a tightly coupled, full-stack
ecosystem that combines hardware, software, network, and applications. Many
users rely on cloud providers for elastic, isolated, and cost-efficient
resources. Unfortunately, these platforms as a service use virtualization,
which means operators have little insight into the users' workloads. This
hinders resource optimizations by the operator, which is essential to ensure
cost efficiency and minimize execution time. In this paper, we argue that
workload knowledge is unnecessary for system-level optimization. We propose
System-X, which takes a \emph{hardware-centric} approach, relying only on
hardware signals -- fully accessible by operators. Using low-level signals
collected from the system, System-X detects anomalies through an unsupervised
learning pipeline. The pipeline is developed by analyzing over 30 popular ML
models on various hardware platforms, ensuring adaptability to emerging
workloads and unknown deployment patterns. Using System-X, we successfully
identified both network and system configuration issues, accelerating the
DeepSeek model by 5.97%.

Motivation: BPH分布难以精确复现重尾行为，HE模型在分布主体部分表现不佳且对初始参数敏感，为解决这些问题开展研究。

Method: 提出BPH和HE分布的混合模型，利用优化设置HE组件的初始参数。

Result: 混合模型能捕捉重尾分布的主体和尾部，在匹配均值和变异系数等参数方面有显著提升，排队理论实验验证其实用性、准确性和精确性。

Conclusion: 新型混合方法比单独应用BPH或HE模型更具性能优势。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed distributions, prevalent in a lot of real-world applications
such as finance, telecommunications, queuing theory, and natural language
processing, are challenging to model accurately owing to their slow tail decay.
Bernstein phase-type (BPH) distributions, through their analytical tractability
and good approximations in the non-tail region, can present a good solution,
but they suffer from an inability to reproduce these heavy-tailed behaviors
exactly, thus leading to inadequate performance in important tail areas. On the
contrary, while highly adaptable to heavy-tailed distributions,
hyperexponential (HE) models struggle in the body part of the distribution.
Additionally, they are highly sensitive to initial parameter selection,
significantly affecting their precision.
  To solve these issues, we propose a novel hybrid model of BPH and HE
distributions, borrowing the most desirable features from each for enhanced
approximation quality. Specifically, we leverage an optimization to set initial
parameters for the HE component, significantly enhancing its robustness and
reducing the possibility that the associated procedure results in an invalid HE
model. Experimental validation demonstrates that the novel hybrid approach is
more performant than individual application of BPH or HE models. More
precisely, it can capture both the body and the tail of heavy-tailed
distributions, with a considerable enhancement in matching parameters such as
mean and coefficient of variation. Additional validation through experiments
utilizing queuing theory proves the practical usefulness, accuracy, and
precision of our hybrid approach.

TL;DR: 企业开源参与风险复杂，传统管理不足，本文开展扎根理论研究，提出整体风险治理框架，经专家验证，助企业从被动应对到主动构建‘免疫系统’。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业开源参与面临复杂风险，传统风险管理无法应对系统性威胁，存在治理盲点，需从战术风险管理转向整体风险治理。

Method: 开展扎根理论研究，与15名从业者合作，基于风险原则构建‘Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation’逻辑链框架。

Result: 提出‘战略目标矩阵’、内外部风险分类和可操作的缓解框架，经行业专家通过回顾性案例研究验证其分析效用。

Conclusion: 该框架为企业提供新诊断视角和系统路径，助其从被动‘救火’转向主动构建组织‘免疫系统’。

Abstract: Enterprise engagement with open source has evolved from tactical adoption to
strategic deep integration, exposing them to a complex risk landscape far
beyond mere code. However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on
technical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream
"silent fixes", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a
dangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable
the necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,
we conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a
holistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical
framework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External
Threat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a
critical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an
undefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the
impact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical
chain: "Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation" (OTVM). This
provides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.
Based on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a "Strategic Objectives Matrix"
to clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,
Ex-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and
(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these
vulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three
industry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.
This work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for
enterprises to shift from reactive "firefighting" to proactively building an
organizational "immune system".

Motivation: 为安全和合规关键领域生成监管就绪工件和机器可检查证据。

Method: 整合统一元模型、集成约束模型和约束引导可验证生成三个支柱，违规时进行审计引导修复并记录生成轨迹。

Result: 在汽车软件工程和跨境法律管辖领域评估，生成结构有效、可审计的工件，能与现有工具集成，大幅减少手动修复工作。

Conclusion: PRISM为内置保证的自动化工件生成提供了实用途径。

Abstract: PRISM unifies Large Language Models with Model-Driven Engineering to generate
regulator-ready artifacts and machine-checkable evidence for safety- and
compliance-critical domains. PRISM integrates three pillars: a Unified
Meta-Model (UMM) reconciles heterogeneous schemas and regulatory text into a
single semantic space; an Integrated Constraint Model (ICM) compiles structural
and semantic requirements into enforcement artifacts including generation-time
automata (GBNF, DFA) and post-generation validators (e.g., SHACL, SMT); and
Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation (CVG) applies these through two-layer
enforcement - structural constraints drive prefix-safe decoding while
semantic/logical validation produces machine-checkable certificates. When
violations occur, PRISM performs audit-guided repair and records generation
traces for compliance review. We evaluate PRISM in automotive software
engineering (AUTOSAR) and cross-border legal jurisdiction (Brussels I bis).
PRISM produces structurally valid, auditable artifacts that integrate with
existing tooling and substantially reduce manual remediation effort, providing
a practical path toward automated artifact generation with built-in assurance.

predicting deadline compliance, illustrating the value of integrating process
mining with machine learning for proactive software project management.

<details>

Motivation: CI/CD管道广泛使用，但开发者对其CWF了解甚少，随着云计算环境影响增加，了解CI/CD服务的CWF愈发重要。

Method: 基于Cloud Carbon Footprint框架的方法，使用包含超220万次工作流运行、超18000个仓库的最大数据集。

Result: GitHub Actions生态系统有显著CWF，2024年碳足迹在乐观情景下为150.5 MTCO2e，悲观情景下为994.9 MTCO2e，水足迹在1989.6至37664.5千升之间，最可能情景下碳足迹456.9 MTCO2e，水足迹5738.2千升。

Conclusion: 可通过减少计算资源浪费来缓解影响，如在低环境影响地区部署运行器、实施严格停用策略、减少仓库大小等。

Abstract: CI/CD pipelines are widely used in software development, yet their
environmental impact, particularly carbon and water footprints (CWF), remains
largely unknown to developers, as CI service providers typically do not
disclose such information. With the growing environmental impact of cloud
computing, understanding the CWF of CI/CD services has become increasingly
important.
  This work investigates the CWF of using GitHub Actions, focusing on
open-source repositories where usage is free and unlimited for standard
runners. We build upon a methodology from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework
and we use the largest dataset of workflow runs reported in the literature to
date, comprising over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000
repositories.
  Our analysis reveals that the GitHub Actions ecosystem results in a
substantial CWF. Our estimates for the carbon footprint in 2024 range from
150.5 MTCO2e in the most optimistic scenario to 994.9 MTCO2e in the most
pessimistic scenario, while the water footprint ranges from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5
kiloliters. The most likely scenario estimates are 456.9 MTCO2e for carbon
footprint and 5,738.2 kiloliters for water footprint. To provide perspective,
the carbon footprint in the most likely scenario is equivalent to the carbon
captured by 7,615 urban trees in a year, and the water footprint is comparable
to the water consumed by an average American family over 5,053 years.
  We explore strategies to mitigate this impact, primarily by reducing wasted
computational resources. Key recommendations include deploying runners in
regions whose energy production has a low environmental impact such as France
and the United Kingdom, implementing stricter deactivation policies for
scheduled runs and aligning their execution with periods when the regional
energy mix is more environmentally favorable, and reducing the size of
repositories.

Motivation: 大语言模型在函数级代码生成有进展，但在真实软件项目中类级实现能力不明，需要评估。

Method: 引入源自开源库的新基准，包含真实类并划分可见和不可见部分，在不同输入规范、检索增强配置和文档完整性水平下评估多个大语言模型。

Result: 大语言模型在合成基准上正确率84% - 89%，在真实类任务上仅25% - 34%；完整文档仅提升1% - 3%准确率；检索增强在部分文档时最有效，提升4% - 7%；错误主要是AttributeError等，合成测试和真实场景侧重不同，检索增强减少逻辑缺陷但可能引入依赖冲突。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在类级工程能力有严重局限，为生产代码辅助工具改进提供了可操作建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation at the function
level, yet their ability to produce correct class-level implementations in
authentic software projects remains poorly understood. This work introduces a
novel benchmark derived from open-source repositories, comprising real-world
classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization
under practical conditions. The evaluation examines multiple LLMs under varied
input specifications, retrieval-augmented configurations, and documentation
completeness levels.
  Results reveal a stark performance disparity: LLMs achieve 84% to 89%
correctness on established synthetic benchmarks but only 25% to 34% on
real-world class tasks, with negligible differences between familiar and novel
codebases. Comprehensive docstrings yield modest gains of 1% to 3% in
functional accuracy, though statistical significance is rare.
Retrieval-augmented generation proves most effective with partial
documentation, improving correctness by 4% to 7% by supplying concrete
implementation patterns absent from specifications. Error profiling identifies
AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes (84% of
cases), with synthetic tests overemphasizing assertion issues and real-world
scenarios highlighting type and attribute mismatches. Retrieval augmentation
reduces logical flaws but can introduce dependency conflicts.
  The benchmark and analysis expose critical limitations in current LLM
capabilities for class-level engineering, offering actionable insights for
enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval
integration in production code assistance tools.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种对潜在顺序依赖测试用例进行优先级排序的方法，通过分析测试类中的共享静态字段识别更可能为顺序依赖的测试，实验表明该方法能显著提高顺序依赖测试检测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有顺序依赖（OD）测试检测和修复方法需多次重跑与顺序依赖无关的测试，为减少重跑次数，需要对潜在OD测试进行优先级排序。

Method: 通过分析测试类中的共享静态字段，识别更可能为顺序依赖的测试。

Result: 在27个项目模块实验中，该方法在23个案例中成功对所有OD测试进行优先级排序，平均减少65.92%的测试执行和72.19%的不必要重跑。

Conclusion: 该方法通过降低执行成本，显著提高了OD测试检测效率。

Abstract: Flaky tests can make automated software testing unreliable due to their
unpredictable behavior. These tests can pass or fail on the same code base on
multiple runs. However, flaky tests often do not refer to any fault, even
though they can cause the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to fail. A
common type of flaky test is the order-dependent (OD) test. The outcome of an
OD test depends on the order in which it is run with respect to other test
cases. Several studies have explored the detection and repair of OD tests.
However, their methods require re-runs of tests multiple times, that are not
related to the order dependence. Hence, prioritizing potential OD tests is
necessary to reduce the re-runs. In this paper, we propose a method to
prioritize potential order-dependent tests. By analyzing shared static fields
in test classes, we identify tests that are more likely to be order-dependent.
In our experiment on 27 project modules, our method successfully prioritized
all OD tests in 23 cases, reducing test executions by an average of 65.92% and
unnecessary re-runs by 72.19%. These results demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves the efficiency of OD test detection by lowering
execution costs.

Abstract: The increasing frequency and sophistication of software supply chain attacks
pose severe risks to critical infrastructure sectors, threatening national
security, economic stability, and public safety. Despite growing awareness,
existing security practices remain fragmented and insufficient, with most
frameworks narrowly focused on isolated life cycle stages or lacking alignment
with the specific needs of critical infrastructure (CI) sectors. In this paper,
we conducted a multivocal literature review across international frameworks,
Australian regulatory sources, and academic studies to identify and analyze
security practices across the software supply chain, especially specific CI
sector. Our analysis found that few existing frameworks are explicitly tailored
to CI domains. We systematically leveraged identified software supply chain
security frameworks, using a "4W+1H" analytical approach, we synthesized ten
core categories (what) of software supply chain security practices, mapped them
across life-cycle phases (when), stakeholder roles (who), and implementation
levels (how), and examined their coverage across existing frameworks (where).
Building on these insights, the paper culminates in structured, multi-layered
checklist of 80 questions designed to relevant stakeholders evaluate and
enhance their software supply chain security. Our findings reveal gaps between
framework guidance and sector-specific needs, highlight the need for
integrated, context-aware approaches to safeguard critical infrastructure from
evolving software supply chain risks.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE)
practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software
systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science
research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of
three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,
including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 "Software Engineering
2030" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions
involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to
systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and

Abstract: Repository-level software engineering tasks require large language models
(LLMs) to efficiently navigate and extract information from complex codebases
through multi-turn tool interactions. Existing approaches face significant
limitations: training-free, in-context learning methods struggle to guide
agents effectively in tool utilization and decision-making based on
environmental feedback, while training-based approaches typically rely on
costly distillation from larger LLMs, introducing data compliance concerns in
enterprise environments. To address these challenges, we introduce
RepoSearch-R1, a novel agentic reinforcement learning framework driven by
Monte-carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach allows agents to generate
diverse, high-quality reasoning trajectories via self-training without
requiring model distillation or external supervision. Based on RepoSearch-R1,
we construct a RepoQA-Agent specifically designed for repository
question-answering tasks. Comprehensive evaluation on repository
question-answering tasks demonstrates that RepoSearch-R1 achieves substantial
improvements of answer completeness: 16.0% enhancement over no-retrieval
methods, 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval methods, and 33% increase
in training efficiency compared to general agentic reinforcement learning
approaches. Our cold-start training methodology eliminates data compliance
concerns while maintaining robust exploration diversity and answer completeness
across repository-level reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了用于非回归测试中测试预言生成的多智能体框架Nexus，它通过结构化流程生成预言，评估显示其显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非回归测试中测试预言生成这一软件工程领域的长期挑战。

Method: 引入Nexus框架，利用不同专业智能体，经过审议、验证和迭代自优化的结构化过程生成测试预言。

Result: 在七个不同基准测试中，Nexus始终大幅优于现有基线，如提高了测试级预言准确性、错误检测率和自动程序修复成功率。

Conclusion: Nexus框架在测试预言生成方面表现出色，能有效提高相关任务的性能。

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Method: 引入基于组合的CHC求解器CHCVERIF，采用软件验证方法，复用成熟软件验证工具。

Result: 在线性整数运算中只有中等成效，在位向量基准测试有一定成功。

Conclusion: 使用软件验证工具作为CHC求解后端是可行且有潜力的，特别是在精心构建的组合支持下。

Abstract: Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) are widely adopted as intermediate
representations for a variety of verification tasks, including safety checking,
invariant synthesis, and interprocedural analysis. This paper introduces
CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based CHC solver that adopts a software verification
approach for solving CHCs. This approach enables us to reuse mature software
verification tools to tackle CHC benchmarks, particularly those involving
bitvectors and low-level semantics. Our evaluation shows that while the method
enjoys only moderate success with linear integer arithmetic, it achieves modest
success on bitvector benchmarks. Moreover, our results demonstrate the
viability and potential of using software verification tools as backends for
CHC solving, particularly when supported by a carefully constructed portfolio.

Motivation: 现有通用代码审查模型在识别和解决安全问题上效果待探索，且适配安全问题面临数据稀缺和评估指标不足的挑战。

Method: 构建安全代码审查数据集，用安全感知微调策略微调大语言模型，集成RAG技术，引入SecureBLEU评估指标。

Result: SecureReviewer在安全问题检测准确率、审查评论质量和实用性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SecureReviewer能有效提升大语言模型在代码审查中识别和解决安全问题的能力。

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

Motivation: 自动化提取方法重构具有挑战性且多为手动操作，开源大语言模型为其提供新途径。

Method: 评估五个3B - 8B参数的开源大语言模型，用自动指标评估功能正确性和代码质量，比较单样本提示和递归批评与改进提示策略。

Result: 递归批评与改进提示策略在测试通过率和重构质量上优于单样本提示，最佳模型有高测试通过率，能降低代码行数和圈复杂度，开发者调查显示超70%接受度。

Conclusion: 质量提示引导的自动重构有益，但传统指标与人类判断有差异，需人工评估，开源基准为后续研究奠基。

Abstract: Automating the Extract Method refactoring (EMR) remains challenging and
largely manual despite its importance in improving code readability and
maintainability. Recent advances in open-source, resource-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer promising new approaches for automating such
high-level tasks. In this work, we critically evaluate five state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, spanning 3B to 8B parameter sizes, on the EMR task for Python
code. We systematically assess functional correctness and code quality using
automated metrics and investigate the impact of prompting strategies by
comparing one-shot prompting to a Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI)
approach. RCI-based prompting consistently outperforms one-shot prompting in
test pass rates and refactoring quality. The best-performing models,
Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI, achieve test pass percentage (TPP)
scores of 0.829 and 0.808, while reducing lines of code (LOC) per method from
12.103 to 6.192 and 5.577, and cyclomatic complexity (CC) from 4.602 to 3.453
and 3.294, respectively. A developer survey on RCI-generated refactorings shows
over 70% acceptance, with Qwen2.5-Coder rated highest across all evaluation
criteria. In contrast, the original code scored below neutral, particularly in
readability and maintainability, underscoring the benefits of automated
refactoring guided by quality prompts. While traditional metrics like CC and
LOC provide useful signals, they often diverge from human judgments,
emphasizing the need for human-in-the-loop evaluation. Our open-source
benchmark offers a foundation for future research on automated refactoring with
LLMs.

Conclusion: 为基于自然语言的网页编辑提供可扩展和透明基础，小开源模型微调后有竞争力。

Abstract: The evolution of web applications relies on iterative code modifications, a
process that is traditionally manual and time-consuming. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) can generate UI code, their ability to edit existing code from
new design requirements (e.g., "center the logo") remains a challenge. This is
largely due to the absence of large-scale, high-quality tuning data to align
model performance with human expectations. In this paper, we introduce a novel,
automated data generation pipeline that uses LLMs to synthesize a high-quality
fine-tuning dataset for web editing, named Instruct4Edit. Our approach
generates diverse instructions, applies the corresponding code modifications,
and performs visual verification to ensure correctness. By fine-tuning models
on Instruct4Edit, we demonstrate consistent improvement in translating human
intent into precise, structurally coherent, and visually accurate code changes.
This work provides a scalable and transparent foundation for natural language
based web editing, demonstrating that fine-tuning smaller open-source models
can achieve competitive performance with proprietary systems. We release all
data, code implementations, and model checkpoints for reproduction.

Abstract: The increasing exploitation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems
in critical domains has made trustworthiness concerns a paramount showstopper,
requiring verifiable accountability, often by regulation (e.g., the EU AI Act).
Classical software verification and validation techniques, such as procedural
audits, formal methods, or model documentation, are the mechanisms used to
achieve this. However, these methods are either expensive or heavily manual and
ill-suited for the opaque, "black box" nature of most AI models. An intractable
conflict emerges: high auditability and verifiability are required by law, but
such transparency conflicts with the need to protect assets being audited-e.g.,
confidential data and proprietary models-leading to weakened accountability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces ZKMLOps, a novel MLOps
verification framework that operationalizes Zero-Knowledge Proofs
(ZKPs)-cryptographic protocols allowing a prover to convince a verifier that a
statement is true without revealing additional information-within
Machine-Learning Operations lifecycles. By integrating ZKPs with established
software engineering patterns, ZKMLOps provides a modular and repeatable
process for generating verifiable cryptographic proof of compliance. We
evaluate the framework's practicality through a study of regulatory compliance
in financial risk auditing and assess feasibility through an empirical
evaluation of top ZKP protocols, analyzing performance trade-offs for ML models
of increasing complexity.

Conclusion: 新的贝叶斯推理调试方法有效，能降低调试时间和难度。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming is a rapidly developing programming paradigm which
enables the formulation of Bayesian models as programs and the automation of
posterior inference. It facilitates the development of models and conducting
Bayesian inference, which makes these techniques available to practitioners
from multiple fields. Nevertheless, probabilistic programming is notoriously
difficult as identifying and repairing issues with inference requires a lot of
time and deep knowledge. Through this work, we introduce a novel approach to
debugging Bayesian inference that reduces time and required knowledge
significantly. We discuss several requirements a Bayesian inference debugging
framework has to fulfill, and propose a new tool that meets these key
requirements directly within the development environment. We evaluate our
results in a study with 18 experienced participants and show that our approach
to online and interactive debugging of Bayesian inference significantly reduces
time and difficulty on inference debugging tasks.

Result: 与现有自动反馈工具对比，Stitch系统更能促进有效学习体验。

Conclusion: 逐步辅导能显著提升学习效果，优于直接展示答案和现有自动反馈工具。

Abstract: Block-based environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in
programming education. While block syntax reduces surface errors, semantic bugs
remain common and challenging for novices to resolve. Existing debugging
workflows typically show the correct program directly to learners, a strategy
that may fix errors but undermines the development of problem-solving skills.
  We present Stitch, an interactive tutoring system that replaces "showing the
answer" with step-by-step scaffolding. The system's Diff-Analyze module
contrasts a student's project with a reference implementation, identifies the
most critical differences, and uses a large language model to explain why these
changes matter. Learners inspect highlighted blocks through a custom rendering
engine, understand the explanations, and selectively apply partial fixes. This
iterative process continues until the intended functionality is achieved.
  We evaluate Stitch in an empirical study, comparing it against a
state-of-the-art automated feedback generation tool for Scratch. Our key
insight is that simply presenting the correct program is pedagogically
ineffective. In contrast, our interactive, step-by-step guided system promotes
a more effective learning experience. More broadly, what constitutes effective
feedback in block-based programming remains an open question. Our evaluation
provides new evidence that step-by-step tutoring significantly enhances
learning outcomes, outperforming both direct-answer approaches and current
automated feedback generation tools.

Conclusion: 研究为结合过程和代码指标预测高风险修复、加强软件安全的更广泛研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities often persist or re-emerge even after being fixed,
revealing the complex interplay between code evolution and socio-technical
factors. While source code metrics provide useful indicators of
vulnerabilities, software engineering process metrics can uncover patterns that
lead to their introduction. Yet few studies have explored whether process
metrics can reveal risky development activities over time -- insights that are
essential for anticipating and mitigating software vulnerabilities. This work
highlights the critical role of process metrics along with code changes in
understanding and mitigating vulnerability reintroduction. We move beyond
file-level prediction and instead analyze security fixes at the commit level,
focusing not only on whether a single fix introduces a vulnerability but also
on the longer sequences of changes through which vulnerabilities evolve and
re-emerge. Our approach emphasizes that reintroduction is rarely the result of
one isolated action, but emerges from cumulative development activities and
socio-technical conditions. To support this analysis, we conducted a case study
on the ImageMagick project by correlating longitudinal process metrics such as
bus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with vulnerability reintroduction
activities, encompassing 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities. Our
findings show that reintroductions often align with increased issue spoilage
and fluctuating issue density, reflecting short-term inefficiencies in issue
management and team responsiveness. These observations provide a foundation for
broader studies that combine process and code metrics to predict risky fixes
and strengthen software security.

Abstract: Keeping software systems up to date is essential to avoid technical debt,
security vulnerabilities, and the rigidity typical of legacy systems. However,
updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone
process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding
systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this
paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy,
across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's
Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing
multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated
migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the
proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study
show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages
between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to
maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate
(39.75%, median).

Conclusion: 不同类型日志解析器各有优劣，两阶段架构可提升精度，SynLog+模块能有效提升解析精度。

Abstract: Logs provide valuable insights into system runtime and assist in software
development and maintenance. Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log
data into structured log data, is often the first step in automated log
analysis. Given the wide range of log parsers utilizing diverse techniques, it
is essential to evaluate them to understand their characteristics and
performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study
comparing syntax- and semantic-based log parsers, as well as single-phase and
two-phase parsing architectures. Our experiments reveal that semantic-based
methods perform better at identifying the correct templates and syntax-based
log parsers are 10 to 1,000 times more efficient and provide better grouping
accuracy although they fall short in accurate template identification.
Moreover, two-phase architecture consistently improves accuracy compared to
single-phase architecture. Based on the findings of this study, we propose
SynLog+, a template identification module that acts as the second phase in a
two-phase log parsing architecture. SynLog+ improves the parsing accuracy of
syntax-based and semantic-based log parsers by 236\% and 20\% on average,
respectively, with virtually no additional runtime cost.

Abstract: We address finance-native collateral optimization under ISDA Credit Support
Annexes (CSAs), where integer lots, Schedule A haircuts, RA/MTA gating, and
issuer/currency/class caps create rugged, legally bounded search spaces. We
introduce a certifiable hybrid pipeline purpose-built for this domain: (i) an
evidence-gated LLM that extracts CSA terms to a normalized JSON
(abstain-by-default, span-cited); (ii) a quantum-inspired explorer that
interleaves simulated annealing with micro higher order QAOA (HO-QAOA) on
binding sub-QUBOs (subset size n <= 16, order k <= 4) to coordinate multi-asset
moves across caps and RA-induced discreteness; (iii) a weighted risk-aware
objective (Movement, CVaR, funding-priced overshoot) with an explicit coverage
window U <= Reff+B; and (iv) CP-SAT as single arbiter to certify feasibility
and gaps, including a U-cap pre-check that reports the minimal feasible buffer
B*. Encoding caps/rounding as higher-order terms lets HO-QAOA target the domain
couplings that defeat local swaps. On government bond datasets and multi-CSA
inputs, the hybrid improves a strong classical baseline (BL-3) by 9.1%, 9.6%,
and 10.7% across representative harnesses, delivering better cost-movement-tail
frontiers under governance settings. We release governance grade artifacts-span
citations, valuation matrix audit, weight provenance, QUBO manifests, and
CP-SAT traces-to make results auditable and reproducible.

Abstract: While investment funds publicly disclose their objectives in broad terms,
their managers optimize for complex combinations of competing goals that go
beyond simple risk-return trade-offs. Traditional approaches attempt to model
this through multi-objective utility functions, but face fundamental challenges
in specification and parameterization. We propose a generative framework that
learns latent representations of fund manager strategies without requiring
explicit utility specification.
  Our approach directly models the conditional probability of a fund's
portfolio weights, given stock characteristics, historical returns, previous
weights, and a latent variable representing the fund's strategy. Unlike methods
based on reinforcement learning or imitation learning, which require specified
rewards or labeled expert objectives, our GAN-based architecture learns
directly from the joint distribution of observed holdings and market data.
  We validate our framework on a dataset of 1436 U.S. equity mutual funds. The
learned representations successfully capture known investment styles, such as
"growth" and "value," while also revealing implicit manager objectives. For
instance, we find that while many funds exhibit characteristics of
Markowitz-like optimization, they do so with heterogeneous realizations for
turnover, concentration, and latent factors.
  To analyze and interpret the end-to-end model, we develop a series of tests
that explain the model, and we show that the benchmark's expert labeling are
contained in our model's encoding in a linear interpretable way.
  Our framework provides a data-driven approach for characterizing investment
strategies for applications in market simulation, strategy attribution, and
regulatory oversight.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型能否通过从公司特定新闻中提取预测信号来改进横截面动量策略。

Method: 将标普500成分股的每日股票收益与高频新闻数据结合，使用对ChatGPT的提示工程查询，让模型评估新闻是否支持过去收益的延续并给出分数，用于选股和确定投资组合权重。

Result: 大语言模型增强的动量策略优于标准多头动量基准，在样本内和模型预训练截止后的真正样本外时期都有更高的夏普和索提诺比率，这些收益对于交易成本、提示设计和投资组合限制具有稳健性，在集中的高确信度投资组合中表现最强。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可作为金融新闻的有效实时解释器，为既定的基于因子的投资策略增加额外价值。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can improve
cross-sectional momentum strategies by extracting predictive signals from
firm-specific news. We combine daily U.S. equity returns for S&P 500
constituents with high-frequency news data and use prompt-engineered queries to
ChatGPT that inform the model when a stock is about to enter a momentum
portfolio. The LLM evaluates whether recent news supports a continuation of
past returns, producing scores that condition both stock selection and
portfolio weights. An LLM-enhanced momentum strategy outperforms a standard
long-only momentum benchmark, delivering higher Sharpe and Sortino ratios both
in-sample and in a truly out-of-sample period after the model's pre-training
cut-off. These gains are robust to transaction costs, prompt design, and
portfolio constraints, and are strongest for concentrated, high-conviction
portfolios. The results suggest that LLMs can serve as effective real-time
interpreters of financial news, adding incremental value to established
factor-based investment strategies.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for reinforcement learning
(RL) in high-stakes settings. We propose a unified conformal prediction
framework for infinite-horizon policy evaluation that constructs
distribution-free prediction intervals {for returns} in both on-policy and
off-policy settings. Our method integrates distributional RL with conformal
calibration, addressing challenges such as unobserved returns, temporal
dependencies, and distributional shifts. We propose a modular pseudo-return
construction based on truncated rollouts and a time-aware calibration strategy
using experience replay and weighted subsampling. These innovations mitigate
model bias and restore approximate exchangeability, enabling uncertainty
quantification even under policy shifts. Our theoretical analysis provides
coverage guarantees that account for model misspecification and importance
weight estimation. Empirical results, including experiments in synthetic and
benchmark environments like Mountain Car, show that our method significantly
improves coverage and reliability over standard distributional RL baselines.

Abstract: Kernel logistic regression (KLR) is a powerful classification method widely
applied across diverse domains. In many real-world scenarios, indefinite
kernels capture more domain-specific structural information than positive
definite kernels. This paper proposes a novel $L_1$-norm regularized indefinite
kernel logistic regression (RIKLR) model, which extends the existing IKLR
framework by introducing sparsity via an $L_1$-norm penalty. The introduction
of this regularization enhances interpretability and generalization while
introducing nonsmoothness and nonconvexity into the optimization landscape. To
address these challenges, a theoretically grounded and computationally
efficient proximal linearized algorithm is developed. Experimental results on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed method in terms of both accuracy and sparsity.

Conclusion: 所提出的偏差校正程序能减轻合成数据的不利影响，提高预测精度并避免过拟合，可应用于更广泛的不平衡数据场景。

Abstract: Imbalanced data, where the positive samples represent only a small proportion
compared to the negative samples, makes it challenging for classification
problems to balance the false positive and false negative rates. A common
approach to addressing the challenge involves generating synthetic data for the
minority group and then training classification models with both observed and
synthetic data. However, since the synthetic data depends on the observed data
and fails to replicate the original data distribution accurately, prediction
accuracy is reduced when the synthetic data is naively treated as the true
data. In this paper, we address the bias introduced by synthetic data and
provide consistent estimators for this bias by borrowing information from the
majority group. We propose a bias correction procedure to mitigate the adverse
effects of synthetic data, enhancing prediction accuracy while avoiding
overfitting. This procedure is extended to broader scenarios with imbalanced
data, such as imbalanced multi-task learning and causal inference. Theoretical
properties, including bounds on bias estimation errors and improvements in
prediction accuracy, are provided. Simulation results and data analysis on
handwritten digit datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 所提方法在解决QP问题上有效，具有良好的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for efficiently solving quadratic
programming (QP) problems by reducing the number of variables in
high-dimensional QPs using instance-specific projection. A graph neural
network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP
instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously
unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the
expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is
formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the
QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization
updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this
bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without
backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the
generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by
neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces
high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming
existing methods.

Conclusion: PILE分数有望拓展到整个PIML领域，并给出拓展方法框架。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates prior physical
information, often in the form of differential equation constraints, into the
process of fitting machine learning models to physical data. Popular PIML
approaches, including neural operators, physics-informed neural networks,
neural ordinary differential equations, and neural discrete equilibria, are
typically fit to objectives that simultaneously include both data and physical
constraints. However, the multi-objective nature of this approach creates
ambiguity in the measurement of model quality. This is related to a poor
understanding of epistemic uncertainty, and it can lead to surprising failure
modes, even when existing statistical metrics suggest strong fits. Working
within a Gaussian process regression framework, we introduce the
Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE) score. Bypassing the ambiguities of test
losses, the PILE score is a single, uncertainty-aware metric that provides a
selection principle for hyperparameters of a PIML model. We show that PILE
minimization yields excellent choices for a wide variety of model parameters,
including kernel bandwidth, least squares regularization weights, and even
kernel function selection. We also show that, even prior to data acquisition, a
special 'data-free' case of the PILE score identifies a priori kernel choices
that are 'well-adapted' to a given PDE. Beyond the kernel setting, we
anticipate that the PILE score can be extended to PIML at large, and we outline
approaches to do so.

Result: 得到了一个可证明鲁棒、共轭且能联合捕捉输出间相关性的多输出高斯过程MO - RCGP。

Conclusion: MO - RCGP能有效处理多输出高斯过程中的问题，通过金融和癌症研究应用进行了验证。

Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) regression allows modelling dependencies
among multiple correlated response variables. Similarly to standard Gaussian
processes, MOGPs are sensitive to model misspecification and outliers, which
can distort predictions within individual outputs. This situation can be
further exacerbated by multiple anomalous response variables whose errors
propagate due to correlations between outputs. To handle this situation, we
extend and generalise the robust and conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP)
framework introduced by Altamirano et al. (2024). This results in the
multi-output RCGP (MO-RCGP): a provably robust MOGP that is conjugate, and
jointly captures correlations across outputs. We thoroughly evaluate our
approach through applications in finance and cancer research.

Conclusion: 可以通过动作驱动过程统一随机过程和强化学习视角，并应用于脉冲神经网络，且与最大熵强化学习建立联系。

Abstract: At the heart of reinforcement learning are actions -- decisions made in
response to observations of the environment. Actions are equally fundamental in
the modeling of stochastic processes, as they trigger discontinuous state
transitions and enable the flow of information through large, complex systems.
In this paper, we unify the perspectives of stochastic processes and
reinforcement learning through action-driven processes, and illustrate their
application to spiking neural networks. Leveraging ideas from
control-as-inference, we show that minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between a policy-driven true distribution and a reward-driven model
distribution for a suitably defined action-driven process is equivalent to
maximum entropy reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 评估因果机器学习模型在预测个体化治疗效果（ITEs）时，条件可交换性假设违反情况下的表现，以及NCOs作为诊断工具的效用。

Method: 进行模拟研究，考察因果森林和X - learner模型在不同条件下ITE估计的混杂偏倚，模拟不同混杂水平、样本量和NCO混杂结构的数据。

Result: 条件可交换性违反时，模型无法恢复真实治疗效果异质性，NCOs能识别受未测量混杂影响的亚组。

Conclusion: 条件可交换性违反限制因果ML模型ITE估计有效性，NCOs可作为检测亚组特定未测量混杂的工具，应纳入因果ML工作流程。

Abstract: Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the
prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical
evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to
evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability
violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.
We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates
generated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions,
including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to
reflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size,
and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level
treatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and
without unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated,
causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect
heterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there
was none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured
confounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it
remained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates,
though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding.
Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of
ITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data.
NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific
unmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to
support the credibility of individualized inference.

Result: 两种方法在多方面可互换，在常见条件下有相同理论保证，得到凸且计算高效的训练程序，避免EWM中典型的NP难组合步骤。

Conclusion: EWM和插件法本质相同，新正则化方法有效。

Abstract: The goal of policy learning is to train a policy function that recommends a
treatment given covariates to maximize population welfare. There are two major
approaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)
approach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a
classification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population
welfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by
maximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on
regression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect
(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.
This study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are
based on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an
exact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of
the policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in
several respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common
conditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization
method for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally
efficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step
typically required in EWM.

Conclusion: 形成了统一的因果推断理论，有助于更系统地进行平均处理效应估计。

Abstract: This note introduces a unified theory for causal inference that integrates
Riesz regression, covariate balancing, density-ratio estimation (DRE), targeted
maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and the matching estimator in average
treatment effect (ATE) estimation. In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and
the regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the
balancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction
term, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,
covariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating
the balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE
in the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is
in a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for
constructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term
becomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density
Ratio Estimation and Riesz Regression.

Abstract: mRNA design and optimization are important in synthetic biology and
therapeutic development, but remain understudied in machine learning.
Systematic optimization of mRNAs is hindered by the scarce and imbalanced data
as well as complex sequence-function relationships. We present RNAGenScape, a
property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates
mRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an
organized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties
for efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector
that contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports
property-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while
remaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that
intermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real
mRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success
rates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods
developed for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous,
data-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape
establishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space
exploration in mRNA sequence modeling.

Abstract: Traditional non-biological storage media, such as hard drives, face
limitations in both storage density and lifespan due to the rapid growth of
data in the big data era. Mirror-image peptides composed of D-amino acids have
emerged as a promising biological storage medium due to their high storage
density, structural stability, and long lifespan. The sequencing of
mirror-image peptides relies on \textit{de-novo} technology. However, its
accuracy is limited by the scarcity of tandem mass spectrometry datasets and
the challenges that current algorithms encounter when processing these peptides
directly. This study is the first to propose improving sequencing accuracy
indirectly by optimizing the design of mirror-image peptide sequences. In this
work, we introduce DBond, a deep neural network based model that integrates
sequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry
environmental factors for the prediction of mirror-image peptide bond cleavage.
In this process, sequences with a high peptide bond cleavage ratio, which are
easy to sequence, are selected. The main contributions of this study are as
follows. First, we constructed MiPD513, a tandem mass spectrometry dataset
containing 513 mirror-image peptides. Second, we developed the peptide bond
cleavage labeling algorithm (PBCLA), which generated approximately 12.5 million
labeled data based on MiPD513. Third, we proposed a dual prediction strategy
that combines multi-label and single-label classification. On an independent
test set, the single-label classification strategy outperformed other methods
in both single and multiple peptide bond cleavage prediction tasks, offering a
strong foundation for sequence optimization.

Result: 通过专家案例研究和定量评估，SIA能有效从社交媒体发现多样且有意义的见解。

Conclusion: SIA系统可有效发现社交媒体见解，支持复杂分析任务中的人机协作。

Abstract: Social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data,
capturing user behaviors, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network
structures. Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as
opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However,
discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually
challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization.
Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language
models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot
adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA
(Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous
multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral
data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization
artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy
that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques,
SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure
multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies
tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive
interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and
refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness.
Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that
SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media
while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多预测模型因预测目标为抽象概念，合适代理变量选择困难，需人机协作加速迭代并保留人类判断。

Method: 研究两种人机协作策略（相关性优先和性能优先）对代理构建的影响，进行控制用户研究。

Result: 性能优先策略能加快迭代和决策，但会使用户倾向于与应用目标不一致的高绩效代理。

Conclusion: 强调人机协作在机器学习目标变量操作化中的机遇和风险，为未来研究提供见解。

Abstract: Predictive modeling has the potential to enhance human decision-making.
However, many predictive models fail in practice due to problematic problem
formulation in cases where the prediction target is an abstract concept or
construct and practitioners need to define an appropriate target variable as a
proxy to operationalize the construct of interest. The choice of an appropriate
proxy target variable is rarely self-evident in practice, requiring both domain
knowledge and iterative data modeling. This process is inherently
collaborative, involving both domain experts and data scientists. In this work,
we explore how human-machine teaming can support this process by accelerating
iterations while preserving human judgment. We study the impact of two
human-machine teaming strategies on proxy construction: 1) relevance-first:
humans leading the process by selecting relevant proxies, and 2)
performance-first: machines leading the process by recommending proxies based
on predictive performance. Based on a controlled user study of a proxy
construction task (N = 20), we show that the performance-first strategy
facilitated faster iterations and decision-making, but also biased users
towards well-performing proxies that are misaligned with the application goal.
Our study highlights the opportunities and risks of human-machine teaming in
operationalizing machine learning target variables, yielding insights for
future research to explore the opportunities and mitigate the risks.

Abstract: Threat modeling plays a critical role in the identification and mitigation of
security risks; however, manual approaches are often labor intensive and prone
to error. This paper investigates the automation of software threat modeling
through the clustering of call graphs using density-based and community
detection algorithms, followed by an analysis of the threats associated with
the identified clusters. The proposed method was evaluated through a case study
of the Splunk Forwarder Operator (SFO), wherein selected clustering metrics
were applied to the software's call graph to assess pertinent code-density
security weaknesses. The results demonstrate the viability of the approach and
underscore its potential to facilitate systematic threat assessment. This work
contributes to the advancement of scalable, semi-automated threat modeling
frameworks tailored for modern cloud-native environments.

Modeling MAESTRO framework for Map, a hybrid of OWASP's AIVSS and SEI's SSVC
for Measure, and the Cloud Security Alliance's Agentic AI Red Teaming Guide for
Manage. By incorporating a zero-trust service mesh, an explainable policy
engine, behavioral analytics, and decentralized accountability hooks, AAGATE
provides a continuous, verifiable governance solution for agentic AI, enabling
safe, accountable, and scalable deployment. The framework is further extended
with DIRF for digital identity rights, LPCI defenses for logic-layer injection,
and QSAF monitors for cognitive degradation, ensuring governance spans

Conclusion: 声学信号可在敏感机器人环境中支持实时、低成本、被动验证，无需硬件修改。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework that uses acoustic side-channel
analysis (ASCA) to monitor and verify whether a robot correctly executes its
intended commands. We develop and evaluate a machine-learning-based workflow
verification system that uses acoustic emissions generated by robotic
movements. The system can determine whether real-time behavior is consistent
with expected commands. The evaluation takes into account movement speed,
direction, and microphone distance. The results show that individual robot
movements can be validated with over 80% accuracy under baseline conditions
using four different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural
Network (DNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Additionally, workflows such as pick-and-place and packing could be
identified with similarly high confidence. Our findings demonstrate that
acoustic signals can support real-time, low-cost, passive verification in
sensitive robotic environments without requiring hardware modifications.

Result: 种子测试用例生成方法使风险结果和工具调用轨迹覆盖率提升2 - 2.5倍；蒸馏的8B红队模型攻击成功率提高100%，超过671B的Deepseek - R1模型。

Conclusion: 迭代框架、结构化推理和红队模型具有有效性和泛化性。

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer
models.

Conclusion: 该模型是复杂网络环境下一代网络安全应用的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that
synergistically combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms to significantly enhance
cybersecurity intrusion detection capabilities. By leveraging the comprehensive
UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns, our approach
effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph structural
relationships and temporal dynamics through sequential analysis of network
events. The integrated attention mechanism provides dual benefits of improved
model interpretability and enhanced feature selection, enabling cybersecurity
analysts to focus computational resources on high-impact security events -- a
critical requirement in modern real-time intrusion detection systems. Our
extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model
achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine learning
approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple evaluation
metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model
achieves particularly strong performance in detecting sophisticated attack
patterns such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits, making it a promising solution
for next-generation cybersecurity applications in complex network environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于后门的数据集所有权验证方法存在易检测、技术复杂、水印模式静态易被去除等问题，需新方法解决。

Method: 训练基于 U - Net 的水印样本生成器，为每个样本生成独特水印；设计含目标样本损失、非目标样本损失和感知相似性损失的复合损失函数；所有权验证时采用黑盒测试。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法有效且对潜在水印去除攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的 SSCL - BW 方法能有效解决现有数据集所有权验证方法的问题，具有较好的实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) heavily relies on
large-scale, high-quality datasets. However, unauthorized commercial use of
these datasets severely violates the intellectual property rights of dataset
owners. Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer
from inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to
label inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical
complexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches
employ static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.
To address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label
backdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked
sample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,
fundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The
core innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three
components: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target
sample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss
maintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box
testing is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined
backdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential
watermark removal attacks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型水印方案无法解决信任问题，即非公开的水印检测无法证明自身公正执行检测。

Method: 提出基于零知识证明（ZKP）的PVMark插件，构建水印检测‘正确执行’的证明及相关ZKP约束，用Python、Rust和Circom实现多个变体。

Result: 在多种水印方案、哈希函数和ZKP协议组合下，PVMark有效工作，能在不影响水印性能的情况下实现公开验证。

Conclusion: PVMark能高效实现公开验证，有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

Result: 梳理了基于HGNN的异常检测方法，明确了常用数据集和指标的优缺点。

Conclusion: 为推进基于HGNN的异常检测向可扩展、可解释和可实际部署的解决方案建立了结构化基础。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in cybersecurity, where identifying
insider threats, access violations, and coordinated attacks is essential for
ensuring system resilience. Graph-based approaches have become increasingly
important for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and
static structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and
temporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by
incorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation,
enabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data. However, current
research on HGNN-based anomaly detection remains fragmented, with diverse
modeling strategies, limited comparative evaluation, and an absence of
standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey
of HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a
taxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze
representative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also
review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting
their strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges
related to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for
future research. This survey aims to establish a structured foundation for
advancing HGNN-based anomaly detection toward scalable, interpretable, and
practically deployable solutions.

Conclusion: 随机 junta 可有效用于验证Impagliazzo硬核引理在多数参数区间的紧性。

Abstract: Consider a function that is mildly hard for size-$s$ circuits. For
sufficiently large $s$, Impagliazzo's hardcore lemma guarantees a
constant-density subset of inputs on which the same function is extremely hard
for circuits of size $s'<\!\!<s$. Blanc, Hayderi, Koch, and Tan [FOCS 2024]
recently showed that the degradation from $s$ to $s'$ in this lemma is
quantitatively tight in certain parameter regimes. We give a simpler and more
general proof of this result in almost all parameter regimes of interest by
showing that a random junta witnesses the tightness of the hardcore lemma with
high probability.

Abstract: We prove a generalization to Jennrich's uniqueness theorem for tensor

an alternative definition of the standard tensor decomposition, which we call
matrix-vector decomposition. Moreover, in the same settings in which our
uniqueness theorem applies, we also design and analyze an efficient randomized
algorithm to compute the unique minimum matrix-vector decomposition (and thus a
tensor rank decomposition of minimum rank).
  As an application of our uniqueness theorem and our efficient algorithm, we
show how to compute all matrices of minimum rank (up to scalar multiples) in
certain generic vector spaces of matrices.

Conclusion: 提出的梯度流视角可用于构建新的分布鲁棒优化算法，为已有方法提供理论极限和优化动态的新见解，数值研究支持理论发现。

Abstract: We propose a mathematically principled PDE gradient flow framework for
distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Exploiting the recent advances in
the intersection of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and gradient flow theory,
we show that our theoretical framework can be implemented as practical
algorithms for sampling from worst-case distributions and, consequently, DRO.
While numerous previous works have proposed various reformulation techniques
and iterative algorithms, we contribute a sound gradient flow view of the
distributional optimization that can be used to construct new algorithms. As an
example of applications, we solve a class of Wasserstein and Sinkhorn DRO
problems using the recently-discovered Wasserstein Fisher-Rao and Stein
variational gradient flows. Notably, we also show some simple reductions of our
framework recover exactly previously proposed popular DRO methods, and provide
new insights into their theoretical limit and optimization dynamics. Numerical
studies based on stochastic gradient descent provide empirical backing for our
theoretical findings.

Result: 未提及具体研究结果。

Conclusion: 为非高度工业化国家的ABET认证过程提供了批判性见解。

Abstract: ABET accreditation is an increasingly prominent system of global
accreditation of engineering programs, and the assessment requires programs to
demonstrate that they meet the needs of the program's stakeholders, typically
industrial potential employers of graduates. To obtain these inputs, programs
are required to assemble an advisory committee board. The views of the advisory
board on the relevance of the degree outcomes are an essential part of this
process. The purpose of this qualitative research study is to explore the
viewpoints that industry stakeholders have on this type of process. The context
for the study was an Ecuadorian engineering program which had successfully
achieved the ABET accreditation. The study drew on interviews undertaken with
industry members who were part of the advisory board. This study focuses on how
they perceive the process and the accreditation awarded, analyzing their views
of its usefulness, especially in relation to the employability of graduates.
Based on the findings, we offer critical insights into this accreditation

*Arne Thomsen,Tilman Tröster,François Lanusse*

TL;DR: 提出混合方法用于宇宙学场级推理，比其他方法更优且数据效率高，为直接拟合观测数据应用提供可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宇宙学场级推理需要可微的前向模型来解决气体和暗物质在流体动力学和引力下的动力学问题。

Method: 提出混合方法，用可微粒子 - 网格求解器计算引力，用神经网络将局部量映射到有效压力场来参数化流体动力学。

Result: 该方法在场和统计量层面上优于替代方法，如焓梯度下降基线，且数据效率高，单个参考模拟足以约束神经压力模型。

Conclusion: 此方法为未来直接将模型拟合到观测数据的应用打开了大门。

Abstract: Cosmological field-level inference requires differentiable forward models
that solve the challenging dynamics of gas and dark matter under hydrodynamics
and gravity. We propose a hybrid approach where gravitational forces are
computed using a differentiable particle-mesh solver, while the hydrodynamics
are parametrized by a neural network that maps local quantities to an effective
pressure field. We demonstrate that our method improves upon alternative
approaches, such as an Enthalpy Gradient Descent baseline, both at the field
and summary-statistic level. The approach is furthermore highly data efficient,
with a single reference simulation of cosmological structure formation being
sufficient to constrain the neural pressure model. This opens the door for
future applications where the model is fit directly to observational data,
rather than a training set of simulations.

Motivation: 评估波多黎各圣胡安深夜酒类销售条例的影响。

Method: 采用多结果合成控制法，使用共同权重估计器，结合联合共形和置换检验。

Result: 目标行业有经济上有意义的重新分配，深夜公共秩序逮捕和暴力犯罪与政策前趋势无明显偏离；因数据限制，联合共形和置换检验未拒绝原假设。

Conclusion: 强调效应大小、时间持久性和趋势拟合度，而非形式显著性，提供代码和诊断信息用于复现。

Abstract: I evaluate San Juan, Puerto Rico's late-night alcohol sales ordinance using a
multi-outcome synthetic control that pools economic and public-safety series. I
show that a common-weight estimator clarifies mechanisms under low-rank outcome
structure. I find economically meaningful reallocations in targeted sectors --
restaurants and bars, gasoline and convenience, and hospitality employment --
while late-night public disorder arrests and violent crime show no clear
departures from pre-policy trends. The short post-policy window and small donor
pool limit statistical power; joint conformal and permutation tests do not
reject the null at conventional thresholds. I therefore emphasize effect
magnitudes, temporal persistence, and pre-trend fit over formal significance.
Code and diagnostics are available for replication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确分析1988 - 2018年全球收入分配的演变情况。

Method: 使用购买力平价汇率和统计分布，用对数正态和伽马函数拟合全球收入分布，通过概率密度函数曲线和互补累积分布函数曲线分析。

Result: 初期全球收入分配呈双峰模式，近年来因中印等国中产阶层增长转变为单峰模式；单函数拟合有一定准确性，双对数正态分布拟合近乎完美。

Conclusion: 采用两个单独分布能更准确呈现全球收入分配数据。

Abstract: The evolution of global income distribution from 1988 to 2018 is analyzed
using purchasing power parity exchange rates and well-established statistical
distributions. This research proposes the use of two separate distributions to
more accurately represent the overall data, rather than relying on a single
distribution. The global income distribution was fitted to log-normal and gamma
functions, which are standard tools in econophysics. Despite limitations in
data completeness during the early years, the available information covered the
vast majority of the world's population. Probability density function (PDF)
curves enabled the identification of key peaks in the distribution, while
complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) curves highlighted
general trends in inequality. Initially, the global income distribution
exhibited a bimodal pattern; however, the growth of middle classes in highly
populated countries such as China and India has driven the transition to a
unimodal distribution in recent years. While single-function fits with gamma or
log-normal distributions provided reasonable accuracy, the bimodal approach
constructed as a sum of log-normal distributions yielded near-perfect fits.

Motivation: 理解社会进步中合作的可持续性。

Method: 研究个体决定向其他成员转移收入份额的重复博弈，考虑收入流动性和不平等因素。

Result: 更大的收入流动性促进合作，不平等的影响取决于贡献规范的累进性和流动性程度。

Conclusion: 将框架应用于最优税收问题，研究公共和私人再分配的相互作用。

Abstract: The sustainability of cooperation is crucial for understanding the progress
of societies. We study a repeated game in which individuals decide the share of
their income to transfer to other group members. A central feature of our model
is that individuals may, with some probability, switch incomes across periods,
our measure of income mobility, while the overall income distribution remains
constant over time. We analyze how income mobility and income inequality affect
the sustainability of contribution norms, informal agreements about how much
each member should transfer to the group. We find that greater income mobility
facilitates cooperation. In contrast, the effect of inequality is ambiguous and
depends on the progressivity of the contribution norm and the degree of
mobility. We apply our framework to an optimal taxation problem to examine the
interaction between public and private redistribution.

TL;DR: 本文通过两个离散选择实验量化北京食品配送服务价值，发现消费者剩余大、定价过低问题，提出按量定价模型以解决外部性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市食品配送服务的流动性和环境外部性未得到规划者充分解决，多数研究忽略消费者是否支付足够费用内化社会成本。

Method: 进行两个离散选择实验，一是衡量放弃服务补偿意愿，二是衡量支付减少等待时间和提高可靠性的意愿。

Result: 放弃服务补偿意愿中位数为588元；减少等待时间和提高可靠性的估值远超典型配送费。表明消费者剩余大，存在定价过低问题。

Conclusion: 城市规划需将数字服务经济纳入定价和流动性框架，提出按配送速度而非订单量的按量定价模型，可解决外部性问题。

Abstract: Urban food delivery services have become an integral part of daily life, yet
their mobility and environmental externalities remain poorly addressed by
planners. Most studies neglect whether consumers pay enough to internalize the
broader social costs of these services. This study quantifies the value of
access to and use of food delivery services in Beijing, China, through two
discrete choice experiments. The first measures willingness to accept
compensation for giving up access, with a median value of CNY588 (approximately
USD80). The second captures willingness to pay for reduced waiting time and
improved reliability, showing valuations far exceeding typical delivery fees
(e.g., CNY96.6/hour and CNY4.83/min at work). These results suggest a
substantial consumer surplus and a clear underpricing problem. These findings
highlight the need for urban planning to integrate digital service economies
into pricing and mobility frameworks. We propose a quantity-based pricing model
that targets delivery speed rather than order volume, addressing the primary
source of externalities while maintaining net welfare gains. This approach
offers a pragmatic, equity-conscious strategy to curb delivery-related
congestion, emissions, and safety risks, especially in dense urban cores.

Abstract: This paper makes the opaque data market in the AI economy empirically legible
for the first time, constructing a computational testbed to address a core
epistemic failure: regulators governing a market defined by structural opacity,
fragile price discovery, and brittle technical safeguards that have paralyzed
traditional empirics and fragmented policy. The pipeline begins with multi-year
fieldwork to extract the market's hidden logic, and then embeds these grounded
behaviors into a high-fidelity ABM, parameterized via a novel LLM-based
discrete-choice experiment that captures the preferences of unsurveyable
populations. The pipeline is validated against reality, reproducing observed
trade patterns. This policy laboratory delivers clear, counter-intuitive
results. First, property-style relief is a false promise: ''anonymous-data''
carve-outs expand trade but ignore risk, causing aggregate welfare to collapse
once external harms are priced in. Second, social welfare peaks when the
downstream buyer internalizes the full substantive risk. This least-cost
avoider approach induces efficient safeguards, simultaneously raising welfare
and sustaining trade, and provides a robust empirical foundation for the legal
drift toward two-sided reachability. The contribution is a reproducible
pipeline designed to end the reliance on intuition. It converts qualitative
insight into testable, comparative policy experiments, obsoleting armchair
conjecture by replacing it with controlled evidence on how legal rules actually
shift risk and surplus. This is the forward-looking engine that moves the field
from competing intuitions to direct, computational analysis.

Abstract: As LLM agents advance, they are increasingly mediating economic decisions,
ranging from product discovery to transactions, on behalf of users. Such
applications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent
accountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires
understanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However,
previous research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as
single-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent
interactions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require
agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large,
dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in
open-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic
marketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents
represent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop
Magentic-Marketplace -- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services
can operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the
utility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and
how search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier
models can approach optimal welfare -- but only under ideal search conditions.
Performance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe
first-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over
quality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions,
informing the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.

Abstract: Algorithmic collusion has emerged as a central question in AI: Will the
interaction between different AI agents deployed in markets lead to collusion?
More generally, understanding how emergent behavior, be it a cartel or market
dominance from more advanced bots, affects the market overall is an important
research question.
  We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to
study algorithmic collusion in market making. The framework includes a
self-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain
environment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the
self-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the
competitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent),
and the hybrid Agent~B$^\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the
other two. To analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and
affect market outcomes, we propose interaction-level metrics that quantify
behavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics, while providing signals
potentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns.
  Experimental results show that Agent~B2 secures dominant performance in a
zero-sum setting against B1, aggressively capturing order flow while tightening
average spreads, thus improving market execution efficiency. In contrast,
Agent~B$^\star$ exhibits a self-interested inclination when co-existing with
other profit-seeking agents, securing dominant market share through adaptive
quoting, yet exerting a milder adverse impact on the rewards of Agents~A and B1
compared to B2. These findings suggest that adaptive incentive control supports
more sustainable strategic co-existence in heterogeneous agent environments and
offers a structured lens for evaluating behavioral design in algorithmic
trading systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统自主性增加导致效率低下，现有方法缺乏主动实时干预，需提升系统鲁棒性和效率。

Method: 引入SupervisorAgent框架，由无大语言模型的自适应过滤器触发，在关键节点进行干预。

Result: 在GAIA基准上，SupervisorAgent使Smolagent框架平均减少29.45%的令牌消耗且不影响成功率，在其他五个基准测试和多种模型中验证了适用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SupervisorAgent是有效的多智能体系统运行时自适应监督框架，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing
autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies,
such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation.
Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking
proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To
this end, we introduce SupervisorAgent, a lightweight and modular framework for
runtime, adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agent's
architecture. Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent
intervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide
inefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA
benchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent
framework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate.
Extensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code
generation, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate
the broad applicability and robustness of our approach. The code is available
at https://github.com/LINs-lab/SupervisorAgent.

Motivation: 在资源受限场景中，智能体追求效率常导致不公平结果，需平衡效率与公平。

Method: 利用动作价值（Q - ）函数，计算每个动作的局部公平增益，引入反事实优势修正项，在集中控制设置下用GIFF修改后的Q值解决分配问题。

Result: 在多个领域的实证评估中，GIFF框架始终优于强基线，能发现有远见的公平策略；理论上证明公平替代指标是真实公平改进的原则性下界，权衡参数可单调调整。

Conclusion: GIFF是一个强大且有原则的框架，可利用标准强化学习组件在复杂多智能体系统中实现更公平的结果。

Abstract: We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a
novel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair
decision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained
settings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes.
Our approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and
fairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method
computes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual
advantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off
agents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where
an arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.
  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing,
homelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our
framework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover
far-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by
a theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower
bound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers
monotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled
framework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve
more equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic

Conclusion: zFLoRA在多个任务上表现良好，且能有效降低推理延迟。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

TL;DR: 研究不同多语言数据混合对预训练大语言模型的影响，挑战了多语言训练的常见观点，表明适当平衡多语言数据可提升模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同多语言数据混合在预训练大语言模型时，语言覆盖范围和模型性能之间潜在的权衡问题，即多语言诅咒。

Method: 在不同的多语言语料库上训练11亿和30亿参数的大语言模型，语言数量从25种到400种不等。

Result: 1. 英语和多语言数据结合不一定降低任一组的语言内性能；2. 以英语为枢纽语言对各语系有益，从特定语系选枢纽语言不一定提升该语系语言性能；3. 此规模模型未观察到显著的多语言诅咒。

Conclusion: 适当平衡多语言数据可增强语言模型能力，且不影响性能，在低资源环境也适用。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

TL;DR: 提出监督强化学习（SRL）框架解决大语言模型多步推理难题，使小模型能学习难题，性能强且可泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多步推理问题上表现不佳，小模型的RLVR和SFT方法存在缺陷，需新方法解决。

Method: 提出SRL框架，将问题解决视为生成逻辑“动作”序列，训练模型在行动前生成内部推理独白，并基于模型动作与专家动作的相似度逐步提供奖励。

Result: SRL使小模型能学习SFT或RLVR无法解决的难题，先使用SRL再用RLVR训练性能最佳，能有效泛化到软件工程任务。

Conclusion: SRL是面向推理的大语言模型的强大且通用的训练框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: 现有工具使用大语言模型在静态数据集上训练，表现有限。本文提出PORTool强化学习方法，通过生成多轨迹、分配奖励等训练模型，实验显示其在准确性和工具调用步骤数上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具使用大语言模型在动态工具调用环境中表现有限，无法探索可能的解决方案。

Method: 提出PORTool强化学习方法，为给定查询生成多个轨迹形成树状结构，为每一步分配奖励，结合步骤相对优势和轨迹相对优势训练大语言模型。

Result: 实验使用17个工具处理用户查询，消融实验证明了逐步骤奖励的必要性和设计鲁棒性，与其他训练方法相比，最终准确性和工具调用步骤数有显著改善。

Conclusion: PORTool方法有效提升了工具使用大语言模型在动态环境中的性能。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

Motivation: 跨语言对齐可能导致文化擦除，研究其知识转移和文化擦除的权衡。

Method: 引入转移 - 定位平面评估框架，分析模型内部表征，提出Surgical Steering推理时方法。

Result: 现有跨语言对齐方法提高事实转移时降低文化定位，不同层可优化不同目标，Surgical Steering方法能平衡二者。

Conclusion: Surgical Steering方法能有效克服当前对齐技术的局限，更好平衡知识转移和文化定位。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Motivation: 当前ITFs的患病率、特征和临床后果尚不明确，需进行研究。

Method: 回顾性队列研究，用基于Transformer的NLP管道识别ITFs并提取结节特征，用逻辑回归分析相关因素。

Result: 115683名患者中7.8%有ITF，多为女性、老年人等；与无ITF者相比，有ITF者诊断、活检等几率更高；多数癌症为乳头状癌。

Conclusion: ITFs常见，与低风险甲状腺癌检测相关，凸显其在过度诊断中的作用，需标准化报告和更有选择性的随访。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Motivation: 解决扩散语言模型实际可控性脆弱的问题，应对更新遗忘这一失效模式。

Method: 提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法，通过每个token的时间步调度实现软语义token排序，有固定和自适应两种策略。

Result: 在情感控制上，准确率提高超20%，困惑度近减半且步数少于五分之一；在去毒任务中，降低了最大毒性和困惑度。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配实现的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控的扩散文本生成的关键。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

Conclusion: WIMHF为从业者提供以人类为中心的分析方法，助其更好理解和使用偏好数据。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG，而现实应用需要全球RAG能力，缺乏对应评估基准。

Method: 引入GlobalQA基准评估全球RAG能力，提出GlobalRAG多工具协作框架，包括块级检索、智能过滤和聚合模块。

Result: 现有RAG方法在全球任务上表现不佳，最强基线F1分数仅1.51，GlobalRAG在Qwen2.5 - 14B模型上F1分数达6.63。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG框架能有效提升全球RAG任务的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

Method: 引入StreetMath基准评估不同架构大语言模型近似能力，应用机制可解释性技术探究内部计算状态。

Result: 大语言模型在近似任务中常尝试计算精确值或调用外部工具，早期层或步骤得出正确答案仍消耗更多token，精确和近似算术运算依赖不同神经组件。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在街头数学场景中不像人类那样表现出认知吝啬性。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

Method: 用谷歌恐龙跑酷、数独等浏览器游戏为测试场景，以游戏内表现分数为量化指标评估不同任务类型表现。

Result: Atlas在数独等逻辑推理任务表现强，完成谜题比人类快；在需精确时机和运动控制的实时游戏中表现差，常无法突破初始障碍。

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务表现出色，但在专业领域表现不佳，需要一种方法将通用模型转变为领域专家模型。

Method: ACER先合成全面的教科书式课程，生成目录并创建符合布鲁姆分类法的问答对，用合成语料进行持续预训练，采用交错课程安排。

Result: 在专业MMLU子集有显著提升，在微观经济学等领域提升5个百分点，所有目标领域宏观平均提升3个百分点，促进跨领域知识转移，在ARC和GPQA等测试提升超2个绝对点，通用推理任务表现稳定。

Conclusion: ACER是一种可扩展且有效的方法，能缩小大语言模型的关键领域差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Motivation: 电子病历以base64编码附件存储使语义问答困难，传统向量数据库方法会遗漏细微临床关系。

Method: 引入CLEAR方法，开发临床笔记问答评估平台，对比零样本大上下文推理和传统基于块的检索增强生成。

Result: CLEAR的F1分数达0.90，使用的标记减少超70%；在平台测试中胜率58.3%，语义相似度0.878，使用标记比宽上下文处理少78%，长笔记性能提升大。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索提高临床自然语言处理的效率和准确性，评估框架可用于评估临床问答系统。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

*Mykhailo Poliakov,Nadiya Shvai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究合成数据生成和微调技术对大语言模型识别错误论证能力的影响，提出MisSynth管道，结果显示微调模型准确性提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关错误信息普遍且有害，难以识别，尤其是扭曲或误解科学发现的声明，需提升大语言模型识别能力。

Method: 提出MisSynth管道，应用检索增强生成（RAG）产生合成谬误样本，用于微调大语言模型。

Result: 微调模型比原始基线有显著的准确性提升，如LLaMA 3.1 8B微调模型在MISSCI测试集上F1分数绝对提高超35%。

Conclusion: 引入合成谬误数据扩充有限标注资源可显著提升零样本大语言模型在现实科学错误信息任务中的分类性能，且对计算资源要求低。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体大语言模型方法成功依赖团队协作，但形成最优团队因模型不透明存在挑战。

Result: 发现功能连贯组，特定主题对话确定的协同团队在下游基准测试中优于随机基线，与基于已知模型专长的手动策划团队准确率相当。

Conclusion: 为协作多智能体大语言模型团队的自动化设计提供新依据。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

*Dinghong Song,Yuan Feng,Yiwei Wang,Shangye Chen,Cyril Guyot,Filip Blagojevic,Hyeran Jeon,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AttnCache框架加速大语言模型推理的预填充阶段，实验显示有显著加速效果且精度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界很多工作负载仅依赖推理的预填充阶段，自注意力计算因二次复杂度成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 基于观察到语义不同句子在各层和头产生相似注意力图，构建注意力图记忆数据库，采用高效缓存和相似度搜索技术检索和复用预缓存的注意力图。

Result: AttnCache在CPU上实现端到端1.2倍和注意力2倍加速，在GPU上实现端到端1.6倍和注意力3倍加速，精度下降可忽略。

Conclusion: AttnCache能有效加速大语言模型推理的预填充阶段，减少自注意力计算开销。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型缺乏透明度和可解释性、微调成本高、结果不一致、环境影响大等问题。

Method: 提出BNLF框架，通过概率机制集成FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet三个大语言模型的预测，将多个大语言模型的情感预测建模为贝叶斯网络中的概率节点进行后期融合。

Result: 在三个具有不同语言和上下文特征的人工标注金融语料库上评估，BNLF比基线大语言模型的准确率稳定提高约6%。

Conclusion: BNLF对数据集变异性具有鲁棒性，概率融合用于可解释情感分类是有效的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

TL;DR: 研究变压器语言模型中线性算子结构，发现关系解码器集合可被简单张量网络压缩，线性映射提取语义属性而非特定关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将Hernandez等人关于单一关系的研究扩展到关系集合，系统研究其组织。

Method: 用简单3阶张量网络压缩关系解码器集合，开发交叉评估协议。

Result: 关系解码器集合可高度压缩，线性映射提取语义属性。

Conclusion: 变压器语言模型中的线性关系解码主要基于属性，而非特定关系。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出InfoFlow框架解决RLVR在深度搜索场景中奖励密度低的问题，在多基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在深度搜索场景中因奖励密度低，应用受限，需解决奖励密度优化问题。

Method: 提出InfoFlow框架，从子问题分解、失败引导提示、双智能体优化三个方面解决问题。

Result: InfoFlow在多个智能体搜索基准测试中显著优于强基线，使轻量级大语言模型达到高级专有大语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: InfoFlow能有效解决奖励密度低的问题，提升智能体深度搜索性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出Evontree框架，利用少量高质量本体规则提取、验证和增强大语言模型中的领域知识，在医学问答基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据敏感领域如医疗保健，缺乏高质量特定领域训练语料阻碍大语言模型适应专业应用，而领域专家有本体规则。

Method: 提出Evontree框架，从原始模型中提取领域本体，用两条核心本体规则检测不一致性，并通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼知识。

Result: 在医学问答基准测试中，与未修改模型和领先监督基线相比始终表现更优，准确率最高提升3.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法对大语言模型低资源领域适应有效、高效且稳健。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: 指出大语言模型‘端到端’说法有误，介绍AutoDeco架构实现真正端到端生成，实验显示其性能优且有指令解码控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型依赖不可微解码过程、需手动调整超参数的问题，实现真正的端到端生成。

Method: 用轻量级头部增强标准Transformer，动态预测特定上下文的温度和top - p值，将解码转化为参数化、token级过程。

Result: 在八个基准测试中显著优于默认解码策略，性能与基于‘破解测试集’的调优基线相当，有基于指令的解码控制能力。

Conclusion: AutoDeco架构实现真正端到端生成，为可引导和交互式大语言模型解码开辟新范式。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Motivation: 现有数学竞赛基准对评估顶级大语言模型效果不佳，因性能饱和，需更严格挑战。

Method: 设计50个难题，由专家交叉验证达IMO难度标准且为原创，仅需最终答案以便自动评分。

Result: 26个大语言模型在AMO - Bench上表现差，最佳模型准确率52.4%，多数低于40%，但有计算量增加的扩展趋势。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型的数学推理能力有很大提升空间，开源AMO - Bench促进相关研究。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中应用增多，需自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级评估。

Method: 提出Gistify任务，让编码大模型创建一个最小自包含文件以复现代码库特定功能。

Result: 当前最先进的模型难以可靠解决Gistify任务，特别是具有长执行跟踪的任务。

Conclusion: 当前编码大模型在Gistify任务上表现不佳，反映出其在代码库结构理解、执行流建模等方面存在不足。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型因自回归设计和大尺寸面临推理延迟挑战，现有方法忽略GPU设备和批量大小等系统变量影响。

Method: 引入考虑推理成本（如GPU配置和批量大小）的动态树解码方法CAST，动态优化树结构。

Result: 在六个不同任务和六种不同大语言模型上实验，速度比传统解码方法快达5.2倍，比现有技术性能高5% - 20%。

Conclusion: CAST方法能有效解决大语言模型推理延迟问题，性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Method: 引入Kimi Delta Attention扩展Gated DeltaNet，用特殊分块算法，预训练基于KDA和MLA混合的Kimi Linear模型。

Result: Kimi Linear在各评估任务中大幅优于全MLA，减少KV缓存使用，提高解码吞吐量。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可替代全注意力架构，性能和效率更优。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在社会中作用增大，需研究其与人类价值的对齐，而以往工作多忽略训练动态，本文旨在研究模型训练过程中价值对齐的产生。

Method: 对不同大小的Llama - 3和Qwen - 3模型，使用流行的监督微调（SFT）和偏好优化数据集及算法进行实验，还使用合成偏好数据集。

Result: SFT阶段一般确立模型价值，后续偏好优化难重新对齐；不同偏好优化算法即使偏好数据相同，也会导致不同价值对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为训练中价值学习提供见解，有助于数据整理、模型和算法选择以提升模型与人类价值的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

Abstract: Aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles like vans and trucks is dominated by
a low-pressure wake, whose control is critical for reducing fuel consumption.
This paper presents an experimental study at $Re_W\approx 78,300$ on active
flow control using four pulsed jets at the rear edges of a bluff body model. A
hybrid genetic algorithm, combining a global search with a local gradient-based
optimizer, was used to determine the optimal jet actuation parameters in an
experiment-in-the-loop setup. The cost function was designed to achieve a net
energy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing the
actuation's energy consumption. The optimization campaign successfully
identified a control strategy that yields a drag reduction of approximately
10%. The optimal control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation from
the bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top and
lateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle Image
Velocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization of
the wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach can
successfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies that
yield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.

Conclusion: DARTS是迈向更灵活集成实时交通事件检测系统的重要一步，对交通管理有重要意义。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

Motivation: 探索利用协作MAVs进行放射性物质定位的新方法，发挥其灵活性优势。

Conclusion: 所提利用协作MAVs定位放射性物质的方法可行且有效。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art
single-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of
ionizing radiation. The detector's exceptionally low weight (40 g) opens up new
possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We
propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to
estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely
sparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly
onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of
the vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to
maximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the
radiation source, and even track a moving radiation source.

TL;DR: 提出Debate2Create (D2C)框架，让大语言模型代理通过辩证辩论共同优化机器人设计和奖励函数，在四足运动基准测试中表现良好，多智能体辩论结合物理反馈是自动化机器人设计的新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化机器人形态和控制的协同设计因设计空间大且身体与行为耦合紧密，是长期挑战。

Method: 引入D2C框架，设计代理提出形态修改，控制代理设计奖励函数，多元评判小组评估并提供反馈，通过迭代辩论优化设计。

Result: D2C产生多样且专业的形态，在四足运动基准测试中发现的设计比默认设计行进距离远73%。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论结合物理反馈是自动化机器人设计的有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a
long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling
between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in
which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical
debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each
round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a
control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A
panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in
simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through
iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing
increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and
specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a
quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther
than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a
powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that
multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising
new paradigm for automated robot design.

Method: 提出Hi - ORS方法，在线微调时过滤负奖励样本稳定价值估计，采用奖励加权监督训练目标提供密集中间步骤监督；开发支持在线人工修正的异步推理训练框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic
manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with
RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at
intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but
often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose
Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection
sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS
stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during
online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective
to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we
develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible
online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for
learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two
embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich
manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL
baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.
Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by
reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better
performance.

Conclusion: 所提出的赛车和超车智能体能够可靠地在赛道上导航并超越对手，在轮对轮赛车和超车方面有较好表现。

Abstract: While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen
significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and
overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly
apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms
struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is
important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe
autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful
opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised
physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate
overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.
This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning
to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and
reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against
opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results
demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate
overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent
trained just to race.

Motivation: 传统机器人对运动学理解有限，局限于预编程任务，难以高效使用工具，为解决工具使用的关键问题开展研究。

Method: 扩展机器人逆运动学求解器，使其能获取不同长度工具的连续动作序列，将仿真学习的动作轨迹与工具集成。

Result: 扩展的逆运动学求解器误差率小于1厘米，训练策略在仿真中平均误差8厘米，不同长度工具表现几乎无差异。

Conclusion: 研究为工具使用的四个基本方面探索带来潜在进展，使机器人能在不同任务中掌握工具操作。

Abstract: Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and
are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools
efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the
desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool
orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering
framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse
kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions
using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action
trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired
skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive
experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver
demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our
trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our
model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two
distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of
potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool
usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across
diverse tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that
combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with
a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller
for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and
sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a
practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance,
action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together
with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is
implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics,
including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning
efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show
improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines
(DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners, with better generalization to
unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes. Code and
evaluation scripts are available at the project repository.

Motivation: LFI中潜在的支持集错误指定会导致次优且错误确定的后验，需解决该问题。

Method: 提出EDGE、MODE和CENTRE三种启发式LFI变体，在LFI步骤中与后验推理一起调整支持集。

Result: 推理结果使DLO参数集的长度和刚度分类更精细，后验作为域分布用于基于模拟的策略学习时，代理性能更稳健。

Conclusion: 所提出的启发式LFI变体有效解决支持集错误指定问题，提升机器人参数推理和策略学习性能。

Abstract: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain
distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment
conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains
constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more
descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to
suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose
three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the
posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated
into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first
expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using
stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic
support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic
deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer
length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the
resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy
learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

TL;DR: 本文引入了新指标InputDSA来比较系统内在和输入驱动的动力学，证明其在多场景的有效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DSA方法未考虑输入对动力学的影响，而现实系统很少是自治的，因此需要考虑输入驱动的影响。

Method: 使用基于子空间识别的动态模式分解控制变体（DMDc）估计和比较输入和内在动态算子，扩展DSA框架得到InputDSA。

Result: InputDSA能成功比较部分观测、输入驱动的系统；未知真实输入时用替代输入影响不大；应用于RNN和大鼠神经数据有良好表现。

Conclusion: InputDSA是比较动力系统内在动力学和外部输入影响的鲁棒高效方法。

Abstract: In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare
observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural
systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and
deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical
Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems
based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However,
DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar
systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because
real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account
for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for
comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA
(iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both
input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode
Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We
demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed,
input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are
unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in
similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing
networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks
are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats
performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from
input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our
work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing
intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.

Result: 该方法比HMC对随机梯度加热有更高的恢复能力，能跨越似然障碍；可在单GPU上对多种神经网络后验分布采样；传统采样器是广义光线追踪框架的特例。

Conclusion: 提出的光线追踪采样方法有效且具有通用性，代码公开可促进应用。

Abstract: We derive a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler based on following ray paths in
a medium where the refractive index $n(x)$ is a function of the desired
likelihood $\mathcal{L}(x)$. The sampling method propagates rays at constant
speed through parameter space, leading to orders of magnitude higher resilience
to heating for stochastic gradients as compared to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC), as well as the ability to cross any likelihood barrier, including holes
in parameter space. Using the ray tracing method, we sample the posterior
distributions of neural network outputs for a variety of different
architectures, up to the 1.5 billion-parameter GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer 2) architecture, all on a single consumer-level GPU. We also show
that prior samplers including traditional HMC, microcanonical HMC, Metropolis,
Gibbs, and even Monte Carlo integration are special cases within a generalized
ray tracing framework, which can sample according to an arbitrary weighting
function. Public code and documentation for C, JAX, and PyTorch are available

Abstract: Pulsar surveys generate millions of candidates per run, overwhelming manual
inspection. This thesis builds a deep learning pipeline for radio pulsar
candidate selection that fuses array-derived features with image diagnostics.
From approximately 500 GB of Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data, raw
voltages are converted to filterbanks (SIGPROC), then de-dispersed and folded
across trial dispersion measures (PRESTO) to produce approximately 32,000
candidates. Each candidate yields four diagnostics--summed profile, time vs.
phase, subbands vs. phase, and DM curve--represented as arrays and images. A
baseline stacked model (ANNs for arrays + CNNs for images with
logistic-regression fusion) reaches 68% accuracy. We then refine the CNN
architecture and training (regularization, learning-rate scheduling, max-norm
constraints) and mitigate class imbalance via targeted augmentation, including
a GAN-based generator for the minority class. The enhanced CNN attains 87%
accuracy; the final GAN+CNN system achieves 94% accuracy with balanced
precision and recall on a held-out test set, while remaining lightweight enough
for near--real-time triage. The results show that combining array and image
channels improves separability over image-only approaches, and that modest
generative augmentation substantially boosts minority (pulsar) recall. The
methods are survey-agnostic and extensible to forthcoming high-throughput
facilities.

Conclusion: ALMGuard防御框架是新的最优方法，代码和数据可在https://github.com/WeifeiJin/ALMGuard获取。

Abstract: Recent advances in Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have significantly improved
multimodal understanding capabilities. However, the introduction of the audio
modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies
have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that
defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or
text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective
against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard,
the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that
safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to
identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as
triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference
time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's
utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM),
which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to
jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both
seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate
of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while
maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new
state of the art. Our code and data are available at

Motivation: 传统手动剪辑广告版本耗时耗力，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 将视频剪辑视为镜头选择问题，开发双流视听融合模型预测帧重要性，创建AdSum204数据集。

Result: 模型在平均精度、曲线下面积等多种指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自动化视频广告剪辑框架有效，强调音频在广告中的作用。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited

architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil

Result: 实现从fMRI忠实地重建所见图像，视觉和客观指标上超当前SotA方法，1小时fMRI数据结果可比肩40小时训练数据的当前方法。

Conclusion: Brain - IT方法有效解决当前图像重建缺乏忠实度问题，少量数据也能有好效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

Motivation: 气候变化和海平面上升使沿海城市面临洪水威胁，传统方法计算成本高，DL技术有数据稀缺等问题，需高效准确的洪水预测方法。

Method: 利用低资源DL框架开发基于CNN的轻量级模型，用两个地区的数据集验证模型泛化能力。

Result: 模型显著优于现有方法，平均降低洪水深度图预测的平均绝对误差近20%。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为可扩展实用的沿海洪水管理工具，助力决策者制定应对策略。

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion

negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

Motivation: 多模态扩散模型对对抗输入的脆弱性研究不足，且现有模型文本与图像模态对齐不足，存在生成不适当内容的风险。

Method: 提出Prompt - Restricted Multi - modal Attack (PReMA)，通过修改输入图像结合指定提示来操纵生成内容，不改变提示本身。

Result: 在多个模型的图像修复和风格迁移任务上的综合评估，证实了PReMA的强大效力。

Conclusion: PReMA对多模态扩散模型的完整性构成新威胁，尤其在固定提示的图像编辑应用中。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Result: 现有Video - LLMs跨视角一致性差，天真微调效果不佳；View - GRPO优于天真SFT和GRPO。

Conclusion: View - GRPO能有效加强特定视角时间推理并促进跨视角一致理解。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 工作有助于推动可泛化、鲁棒和安全的端到端自动驾驶研究。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

Conclusion: MV - MLM在乳腺癌分类和风险预测任务中表现优秀，且无需实际放射报告，数据效率高。

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Result: 能捕捉多种视觉概念，激活产生的空间归因与有意义图像区域一致，可靠检测已知偏差并发现新偏差。

Conclusion: ConceptScope是用于数据集审计和模型诊断的实用工具。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GLYPH - SR框架解决图像超分辨率中场景文本问题，兼顾文本可读性和感知质量，实验效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往图像超分辨率研究对字符级错误不敏感，处理文本时忽略复杂场景挑战，需兼顾文本可读性和感知质量。

Method: 提出GLYPH - SR框架，利用OCR数据引导的Text - SR Fusion ControlNet和乒乓调度器，在合成语料库上训练组件。

Result: 在多个数据集上，相比扩散/GAN基线，GLYPH - SR最高提升OCR F1达15.18个百分点，同时保持竞争力的感知指标。

Conclusion: GLYPH - SR能同时满足高可读性和高视觉真实感。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练时让模型基于多个奖励模型，直接学习用户偏好。

Result: 显著提升生成图像的视觉质量，大幅加快训练速度，在GenEval基准和用户偏好评分上达SOTA。

Conclusion: 在训练中结合多奖励模型的MIRO方法有效，能提升图像生成效果和训练效率。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

Conclusion: LoCoT2V - Bench为长形式复杂文本到视频生成评估提供了全面可靠的平台，指明了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

Result: 在Qwen2 - VL - 7B - Instruct和InternVL2.5 - 4B模型的视觉推理任务实验中，方法平均比普通自改进提升3.86分。

Conclusion: 提出的策略能有效提升大视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Conclusion: ResMatching是一种有效的CSR方法，能处理复杂情况并提供不确定性信息指导预测。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: We present a long-term deployment study of a machine vision-based anomaly
detection system for failure prediction in a steel rolling mill. The system
integrates industrial cameras to monitor equipment operation, alignment, and
hot bar motion in real time along the process line. Live video streams are
processed on a centralized video server using deep learning models, enabling
early prediction of equipment failures and process interruptions, thereby
reducing unplanned breakdown costs. Server-based inference minimizes the
computational load on industrial process control systems (PLCs), supporting
scalable deployment across production lines with minimal additional resources.
By jointly analyzing sensor data from data acquisition systems and visual
inputs, the system identifies the location and probable root causes of
failures, providing actionable insights for proactive maintenance. This

Conclusion: 框架提供轻量级的表示级反事实方法，为无偏可靠的多模态推理提供实用因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 对Veo - 3视频模型进行实证研究，评估其在视觉推理场景的能力，发现当前视频模型有优势但也有限制，还不能作为可靠的零样本推理器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视频模型是否能在具有挑战性的视觉推理场景中作为零样本推理器。

Method: 以Veo - 3为研究对象，从12个维度评估其推理行为，创建MME - CoF基准进行评估。

Result: 当前视频模型在短期空间连贯性、细粒度定位和局部一致动态方面有推理表现，但在长期因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面存在局限。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型还不能作为可靠的独立零样本推理器，但可作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

TL;DR: 本文提出CYPRESS深度学习模型用于高分辨率油菜产量预测，在加拿大草原数据集上表现优于现有模型，为精准农业提供可操作工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法缺乏精准农业所需的可扩展性和粒度，准确及时的作物产量预测对全球粮食安全和现代农业管理至关重要。

Method: 引入CYPRESS模型，利用预训练的大规模地理空间基础模型Prithvi - EO - 2.0 - 600M，将其应用于连续回归任务，把多时间卫星图像转化为密集的像素级产量图。

Result: 在加拿大草原的综合数据集上评估，CYPRESS表现优于现有的基于深度学习的产量预测模型。

Conclusion: 验证了一种新方法，弥合了大规模地球观测和农场决策之间的差距，为详细农业监测提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

TL;DR: 介绍轻量级SteerVLM引导VLM输出，提出VNIA数据集，性能超现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 引导VLM输出更符合指令，在不修改模型权重下控制输出语义。

Method: 从成对提示的潜在嵌入学习，通过维度激活调制和跨层自适应引导控制模型，创建VNIA数据集。

Result: SteerVLM学习参数仅为原VLM的0.14%，在转向和幻觉缓解基准测试中表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过激活工程为多模态模型控制提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM
challenge - the most comprehensive AMD detection from RGB fundus images
research competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our
evaluation. Taking the U-Net connectivity as a base of our framework, we
evaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's
architecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques,
encoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized
loss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main
outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection
framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the
multi-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB
fundus images. The source code used to conduct the experiments presented in
this paper is made freely available.

Motivation: 现有运动动力学建模方法依赖手动或启发式分层及固定运动基元，泛化性受限。

Method: 用基于图的分层表示运动，将全局绝对运动分解为父继承模式和局部运动残差，将分层推理表述为可微图学习问题。

Conclusion: 该自适应、数据驱动的分层建模范式适用于广泛的以运动为中心的任务。

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Motivation: 现有图像地理定位方法存在不足，标准图像检索技术效率低，可扩展解决方案存在精度与覆盖范围的权衡问题，需要一种能在大地理范围内实现细粒度定位的方法。

Method: 引入混合方法，在训练中利用代理分类任务学习丰富特征表示，将学习到的原型与航空影像嵌入相结合。

Result: 在覆盖欧洲大部分地区的数据集上，超68%的查询可在200米内定位。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能在大地理范围内实现细粒度地理定位，具有良好效果。

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

Result: 模型在全景视觉感知和图形就绪的3D场景生成中有效。

Conclusion: 为沉浸式和物理逼真的虚拟世界生成开辟了新可能。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Result: 建立了三种典型机制的近最优逐元素收敛率，得到匹配诱导依赖采样下的渐近正态性和有限样本保证。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能提供准确估计、有效的置信区间和对匹配策略的高效评估。

Abstract: This paper studies decision-making and statistical inference for two-sided
matching markets via matrix completion. In contrast to the independent sampling
assumed in classical matrix completion literature, the observed entries, which
arise from past matching data, are constrained by matching capacity. This
matching-induced dependence poses new challenges for both estimation and
inference in the matrix completion framework. We propose a non-convex algorithm
based on Grassmannian gradient descent and establish near-optimal entrywise
convergence rates for three canonical mechanisms, i.e., one-to-one matching,
one-to-many matching with one-sided random arrival, and two-sided random
arrival. To facilitate valid uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing
on matching decisions, we further develop a general debiasing and projection
framework for arbitrary linear forms of the reward matrix, deriving asymptotic
normality with finite-sample guarantees under matching-induced dependent
sampling. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
provides accurate estimation, valid confidence intervals, and efficient
evaluation of matching policies.

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.
While recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image
segmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their
effectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we
propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel
two-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation
accuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior
network and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse
localization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial
guidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises
four essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric
cross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures
global semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses
on features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the
global and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed
across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the
flow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the
final encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and
utilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to
existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: 提出的区域分解方法在求解变系数椭圆偏微分方程上有效且高效。

Abstract: A domain decomposition method for the solution of general
variable-coefficient elliptic partial differential equations on regular domains
is introduced. The method is based on tessellating the domain into overlapping
thin slabs or shells, and then explicitly forming a reduced linear system that
connects the different domains. Rank-structure ('H-matrix structure') is
exploited to handle the large dense blocks that arise in the reduced linear
system. Importantly, the formulation used is well-conditioned, as it converges
to a second kind Fredholm equation as the precision in the local solves is
refined. Moreover, the dense blocks that arise are far more data-sparse than in
existing formulations, leading to faster and more efficient H-matrix
arithmetic. To form the reduced linear system, black-box randomized compression
is used, taking full advantage of the fact that sparse direct solvers are
highly efficient on the thin sub-domains. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our solver can handle oscillatory 2D and 3D problems with as many as 28
million degrees of freedom.

Motivation: 5G NR中基于互易性的波束成形存在资源和覆盖限制，现有MAE方法存在过拟合问题。

Method: 提出基于扩散的信道修复框架，在推理时通过似然梯度项整合系统模型知识。

Result: 在标准化CDL信道上，基于分数的扩散变体在分布偏移时表现优于UNet分数模型基线和一步MAE，在具有挑战性的设置中NMSE改善达14 dB。

Conclusion: 扩散引导的修复是5G NR系统超容量SRS设计的一种稳健且可推广的方法。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for reliable multiuser
MIMO operation. In 5G NR, reciprocity-based beamforming via uplink Sounding
Reference Signals (SRS) face resource and coverage constraints, motivating
sparse non-uniform SRS allocation. Prior masked-autoencoder (MAE) approaches
improve coverage but overfit to training masks and degrade under unseen
distortions (e.g., additional masking, interference, clipping, non-Gaussian
noise). We propose a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that
integrates system-model knowledge at inference via a likelihood-gradient term,
enabling a single trained model to adapt across mismatched conditions. On
standardized CDL channels, the score-based diffusion variant consistently
outperforms a UNet score-model baseline and the one-step MAE under distribution
shift, with improvements up to 14 dB NMSE in challenging settings (e.g.,
Laplace noise, user interference), while retaining competitive accuracy under
matched conditions. These results demonstrate that diffusion-guided inpainting
is a robust and generalizable approach for super-capacity SRS design in 5G NR
systems.

Motivation: 经典高分辨率技术和通用机器学习方法在波达角估计中存在局限，前者需多元素阵列和大量快照，后者模型缺乏物理可解释性。

Method: 提出基于符号回归的SABER框架，自动从路径损耗测量中发现具有可解释性的闭式波束方向图和波达角模型。

Conclusion: SABER是现有波达角估计中最先进和黑盒机器学习方法的可解释且准确的替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation
wireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision
localization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution
techniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,
while generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models
that lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a
Symbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based
Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained
symbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam
pattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER
achieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and
interpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a
controlled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of
the known $\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5
degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further
reduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that
lack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a
real-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.
SABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with
near-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\'er-Rao Lower
Bounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and
accurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA
estimation.

Abstract: This article investigates the pedestrian group as an emergent agent. The
article explores empirical data to derive emergent agency and formation state
spaces and outline recurring patterns of walking behavior. In this analysis,
pedestrian trajectories extracted from surveillance videos are used along with
manually annotated pedestrian group memberships. We conducted manual expert
evaluation of observed groups, produced new manual annotations for relevant
events pertaining to group behavior and extracted metrics relevant group
formation. This information along with quantitative analysis was used to model
the life-cycle and formation of the group agent. Those models give structure to
expectations around walking behavior of groups; from pedestrian walking
independently to the emergence of a collective intention where group members
tended to maintain bounded distance between each other. Disturbances to this
bounded distance often happened in association with changes in either their
agency or their formation states. We summarized the patterns of behavior along
with the sequences of state transitions into abstract patterns, which can aid
in the development of more detailed group agents in simulation and in the
design of engineering systems to interact with such groups.

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum computers hold promise for scaling up to hundreds of
thousands of qubits, but their progress is constrained by slow qubit readout.
Measuring qubits currently takes milliseconds-much longer than the underlying
quantum gate operations-making readout the primary bottleneck in deploying
quantum error correction. Because each round of QEC depends on measurement,
long readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution.
Reducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors
that accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected
photons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves
neutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but
unreliable readout.
  We show that image denoising can resolve this tension. Our framework,
GANDALF, uses explicit denoising using image translation to reconstruct clear
signals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification
at up to 1.6x shorter readout times. Combined with lightweight classifiers and
a pipelined readout design, our approach both reduces logical error rate by up
to 35x and overall QEC cycle time up to 1.77x compared to state-of-the-art
CNN-based readout for Cesium (Cs) Neutral Atom arrays.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计高效量子电路是探索量子计算潜力的瓶颈，传统门序列搜索空间大且手工模板浪费资源，需要新方法。

Method: 引入基于生成流网络（GFlowNets）的FlowQ - Net框架，学习随机策略按用户定义奖励函数顺序构建电路。

Result: 对变分量子算法（VQA）的多个应用进行模拟，设计的电路在参数、门和深度上比常用基线紧凑10 - 30倍，在真实设备误差下仍有效。

Conclusion: 生成模型可作为通用方法用于自动量子电路设计，有望实现更高效量子算法，加速量子领域科学发现。

Abstract: Designing efficient quantum circuits is a central bottleneck to exploring the
potential of quantum computing, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices, where circuit efficiency and resilience to errors are
paramount. The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and
handcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce
\textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework
for automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits
sequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward
function that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth,
and gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse
ensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.
We demonstrate the efficacy of \textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of
simulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz
design for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image
classification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuits
designed by \textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yielding
circuits that are 10$\times$-30$\times$ more compact in terms of parameters,
gates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, without
compromising accuracy. This trend holds even when subjected to error profiles
from real-world quantum devices. Our results underline the potential of
generative models as a general-purpose methodology for automated quantum
circuit design, offering a promising path towards more efficient quantum
algorithms and accelerating scientific discovery in the quantum domain.

### [312] [Flex-GAD : Flexible Graph Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25809)
*Apu Chakraborty,Anshul Kumar,Gagan Raj Gupta*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出Flex - GAD框架用于图节点异常检测，在七个真实图数据集上评估，AUC提升，训练时间显著减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在属性网络中检测异常节点对识别欺诈等行为至关重要，需有效方法。

Method: 提出Flex - GAD框架，集成两个编码器（社区GCN编码器和属性编码器），用自注意力表示融合模块融合信息。

Result: 平均AUC比之前最佳方法GAD - NR提升7.98%，训练时间比Anomaly DAE快102倍，比GAD - NR快3倍。

Conclusion: Flex - GAD在不同图结构上有效且灵活。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous nodes in attributed networks, where each node is
associated with both structural connections and descriptive attributes, is
essential for identifying fraud, misinformation, and suspicious behavior in
domains such as social networks, academic citation graphs, and e-commerce
platforms. We propose Flex-GAD, a novel unsupervised framework for graph
anomaly detection at the node level. Flex-GAD integrates two encoders to
capture complementary aspects of graph data. The framework incorporates a novel
community-based GCN encoder to model intra-community and inter-community
information into node embeddings, thereby ensuring structural consistency,
along with a standard attribute encoder. These diverse representations are
fused using a self-attention-based representation fusion module, which enables
adaptive weighting and effective integration of the encoded information. This
fusion mechanism allows automatic emphasis of the most relevant node
representation across different encoders. We evaluate Flex-GAD on seven
real-world attributed graphs with varying sizes, node degrees, and attribute
homogeneity. Flex-GAD achieves an average AUC improvement of 7.98% over the
previously best-performing method, GAD-NR, demonstrating its effectiveness and
flexibility across diverse graph structures. Moreover, it significantly reduces
training time, running 102x faster per epoch than Anomaly DAE and 3x faster per
epoch than GAD-NR on average across seven benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 本文基于Facebook实验开发了基于代理的模拟框架，结合人口分布、Twitter网络拓扑和LLM代理研究动员信息对选民投票率的影响，模拟器能重现实地实验模式，为政治动员研究提供可控环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线社交网络改变政治动员信息传播方式，引发对大规模同伴影响机制的疑问，需要研究动员信息对选民投票率的影响。

Method: 开发基于代理的模拟框架，为模拟代理分配人口属性、政治立场和LLM变体，让代理在现实社交网络结构中互动，复制原Facebook研究的信息和社会动员处理。

Result: 模拟器能重现实地实验中的定性模式，如社会信息处理下更强的动员效果和可测量的同伴溢出效应。

Conclusion: 该框架为政治动员研究提供了可控、可重复的环境，架起了高有效性实地实验和灵活计算建模之间的桥梁。

Abstract: Online social networks have transformed the ways in which political
mobilization messages are disseminated, raising new questions about how peer
influence operates at scale. Building on the landmark 61-million-person
Facebook experiment \citep{bond201261}, we develop an agent-based simulation
framework that integrates real U.S. Census demographic distributions, authentic
Twitter network topology, and heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents
to examine the effect of mobilization messages on voter turnout. Each simulated
agent is assigned demographic attributes, a personal political stance, and an
LLM variant (\texttt{GPT-4.1}, \texttt{GPT-4.1-Mini}, or \texttt{GPT-4.1-Nano})
reflecting its political sophistication. Agents interact over realistic social
network structures, receiving personalized feeds and dynamically updating their
engagement behaviors and voting intentions. Experimental conditions replicate
the informational and social mobilization treatments of the original Facebook
study. Across scenarios, the simulator reproduces qualitative patterns observed
in field experiments, including stronger mobilization effects under social
message treatments and measurable peer spillovers. Our framework provides a
controlled, reproducible environment for testing counterfactual designs and
sensitivity analyses in political mobilization research, offering a bridge
between high-validity field experiments and flexible computational
modeling.\footnote{Code and data available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨先进预算技术和经济指标对加州社区大学资金水平和战略一致性的影响，发现宏观经济指标与资金水平强相关，强调教育领导者应将经济预测纳入预算规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管实施了预算改革，许多加州社区大学在财务规划与机构使命（尤其是支持DEI倡议）的对齐方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 采用定量相关设计，分析30年公开经济数据（失业率、GDP增长、CPI）与社区大学资金趋势的关系。

Result: GDP增长、CPI与社区大学资金水平呈强正相关，凸显宏观经济指标在预算规划中的预测价值。

Conclusion: 教育领导者需将经济预测纳入预算规划流程，以保障机构有效性和维持服务代表性不足学生群体的项目。

Abstract: This study explored how advanced budgeting techniques and economic indicators
influence funding levels and strategic alignment in California Community
Colleges (CCCs). Despite widespread implementation of budgeting reforms, many
CCCs continue to face challenges aligning financial planning with institutional
missions, particularly in supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
initiatives. The study used a quantitative correlational design, analyzing 30
years of publicly available economic data, including unemployment rates, GDP
growth, and CPI, in relation to CCC funding trends. Results revealed a strong
positive correlation between GDP growth and CCC funding levels, as well as
between CPI and funding levels, underscoring the predictive value of
macroeconomic indicators in budget planning. These findings emphasize the need
for educational leaders to integrate economic forecasting into budget planning
processes to safeguard institutional effectiveness and sustain programs serving
underrepresented student populations.

Conclusion: 该框架为解释基础模型编码的生物知识提供原则性方法，利于假设生成和发现。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq foundation models achieve strong performance on
downstream tasks but remain black boxes, limiting their utility for biological
discovery. Recent work has shown that sparse dictionary learning can extract
concepts from deep learning models, with promising applications in biomedical
imaging and protein models. However, interpreting biological concepts remains
challenging, as biological sequences are not inherently human-interpretable. We
introduce a novel concept-based interpretability framework for single-cell
RNA-seq models with a focus on concept interpretation and evaluation. We
propose an attribution method with counterfactual perturbations that identifies
genes that influence concept activation, moving beyond correlational approaches
like differential expression analysis. We then provide two complementary
interpretation approaches: an expert-driven analysis facilitated by an
interactive interface and an ontology-driven method with attribution-based
biological pathway enrichment. Applying our framework to two well-known
single-cell RNA-seq models from the literature, we interpret concepts extracted
by Top-K Sparse Auto-Encoders trained on two immune cell datasets. With a
domain expert in immunology, we show that concepts improve interpretability
compared to individual neurons while preserving the richness and
informativeness of the latent representations. This work provides a principled
framework for interpreting what biological knowledge foundation models have
encoded, paving the way for their use for hypothesis generation and discovery.

Motivation: 探索Theta在约束Horn子句（CHCs）环境下的验证技术、设计权衡和局限性。

Result: 2025年竞赛中Theta因配置问题表现不佳，校正配置后重新执行得到新的性能结果。

Conclusion: 通过研究Theta的算法、优缺点及校正配置后的性能，能更清晰了解其实际能力。

Abstract: Theta is a verification framework that has participated in the CHC-COMP
competition since 2023. While its core approach -- based on transforming
constrained Horn clauses (CHCs) into control-flow automata (CFAs) for analysis
-- has remained mostly unchanged, Theta's verification techniques, design
trade-offs, and limitations have remained mostly unexplored in the context of
CHCs. This paper fills that gap: we provide a detailed description of the
algorithms employed by Theta, highlighting the unique features that distinguish
it from other CHC solvers. We also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the
tool in the context of CHC-COMP benchmarks. Notably, in the 2025 edition of the
competition, Theta's performance was impacted by a configuration issue, leading
to suboptimal results. To provide a clearer picture of Theta's actual
capabilities, we re-execute the tool on the competition benchmarks under
corrected settings and report on the resulting performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G中基于DRL的用户选择方法存在安全问题，现有研究假设不实际，需研究新攻击方式。

Method: 利用观察归一化器估计受害者本地观测上下界，结合多面体抽象域开发FGGM攻击方案。

Result: FGGM能确定对抗性CSI向量，在不知受害者本地观测值情况下将其网络吞吐量降低70%。

Conclusion: 该研究可作为案例应用于其他基于DRL的问题。

Abstract: In 5G mobile communication systems, MU-MIMO has been applied to enhance
spectral efficiency and support high data rates. To maximize spectral
efficiency while providing fairness among users, the base station (BS) needs to
selects a subset of users for data transmission. Given that this problem is
NP-hard, DRL-based methods have been proposed to infer the near-optimal
solutions in real-time, yet this approach has an intrinsic security problem.
This paper investigates how a group of adversarial users can exploit
unsanitized raw CSIs to launch a throughput degradation attack. Most existing
studies only focused on systems in which adversarial users can obtain the exact
values of victims' CSIs, but this is impractical in the case of uplink
transmission in LTE/5G mobile systems. We note that the DRL policy contains an
observation normalizer which has the mean and variance of the observation to
improve training convergence. Adversarial users can then estimate the upper and
lower bounds of the local observations including the CSIs of victims based
solely on that observation normalizer. We develop an attacking scheme FGGM by
leveraging polytope abstract domains, a technique used to bound the outputs of
a neural network given the input ranges. Our goal is to find one set of
intentionally manipulated CSIs which can achieve the attacking goals for the
whole range of local observations of victims. Experimental results demonstrate
that FGGM can determine a set of adversarial CSI vector controlled by
adversarial users, then reuse those CSIs throughout the simulation to reduce
the network throughput of a victim up to 70\% without knowing the exact value
of victims' local observations. This study serves as a case study and can be
applied to many other DRL-based problems, such as a knapsack-oriented resource
allocation problems.

potential of physics-guided mixture models to examine the underlying physical
