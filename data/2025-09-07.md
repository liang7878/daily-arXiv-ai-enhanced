### [1] [PG-Agent: An Agent Powered by Page Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03536)
*Weizhi Chen,Ziwei Wang,Leyang Yang,Sheng Zhou,Xiaoxuan Tang,Jiajun Bu,Yong Li,Wei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文设计自动化流程将顺序情节转换为页面图，引入RAG技术，提出PG - Agent框架，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理利用顺序情节作为先验知识，难以捕捉页面间复杂转换关系，难以深入感知GUI环境和泛化到新场景。

Method: 设计自动化管道将顺序情节转换为页面图，引入RAG技术从页面图中检索感知指南，提出带任务分解策略的多智能体框架PG - Agent并注入指南。

Result: 在各种基准测试上的大量实验表明，即使构建页面图的情节有限，PG - Agent也有效。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能让GUI代理更好地感知GUI环境并泛化到新场景。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究因果模型中部分可识别查询，提出新算法简化程序构建，用列生成技术计算概率界，实验表明该技术优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分变量未完全指定的因果模型中，无法精确计算感兴趣的概率值，需要研究概率界限的计算。

Method: 提出新算法利用内生变量输入概率简化程序构建，对单干预场景用列生成技术通过一系列辅助线性整数程序计算概率界。

Result: 实验显示列生成技术优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新算法和列生成技术在计算因果模型中概率界限问题上有效且更优。

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

### [3] [Diffusion-RL Based Air Traffic Conflict Detection and Resolution Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03550)
*Tonghe Li,Jixin Liu,Weili Zeng,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 针对现有CD&R的DRL方法存在单模态偏差问题，提出Diffusion - AC框架，结合DPSC训练机制，实验显示该方法优于基准，在高密度场景下提升成功率、降低近空碰撞率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DRL的CD&R方法存在“单模态偏差”，面对复杂动态约束时决策缺乏灵活性，易出现“决策死锁”，需改进。

Method: 将扩散概率模型集成到CD&R中，提出Diffusion - AC框架，其策略建模为值函数引导的反向去噪过程，还采用DPSC训练机制。

Result: 提出的方法显著优于一系列先进的DRL基准，在高密度场景下成功率达94.1%，近空碰撞率降低约59%。

Conclusion: Diffusion - AC框架独特的多模态决策能力使其能灵活切换有效替代策略，显著提升系统安全裕度。

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

### [4] [Learning When to Plan: Efficiently Allocating Test-Time Compute for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03581)
*Davide Paglieri,Bartłomiej Cupiał,Jonathan Cook,Ulyana Piterbarg,Jens Tuyls,Edward Grefenstette,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster,Jack Parker-Holder,Tim Rocktäschel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出动态规划框架和两阶段训练方法，提升大语言模型代理在顺序决策任务中的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在大语言模型代理规划中存在计算成本高、长时任务性能差等问题，需要新方法解决。

Method: 引入动态规划概念框架，提出两阶段训练管道，先在合成数据上监督微调，再用强化学习优化。

Result: 在Crafter环境实验表明，该方法训练的代理样本效率更高，能达成更复杂目标，且可被人类计划有效引导。

Conclusion: 本工作首次探索大语言模型代理在顺序决策任务中的动态测试时间计算分配，为更高效、自适应和可控的代理系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

### [5] [Explainable Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) with KG-SMILE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03626)
*Zahra Zehtabi Sabeti Moghaddam,Zeinab Dehghani,Maneeha Rani,Koorosh Aslansefat,Bhupesh Kumar Mishra,Rameez Raja Kureshi,Dhavalkumar Thakker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出KG - SMILE框架提升图RAG透明度，评估显示其能平衡模型有效性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI有幻觉问题，RAG虽提升准确性但不透明且依赖数据质量，需提升其透明度。

Method: 开发方法无关、基于扰动的KG - SMILE框架，通过控制扰动、计算相似度和训练加权线性替代模型识别关键图实体和关系。

Result: 使用综合归因指标评估，发现KG - SMILE能产生稳定、符合人类认知的解释。

Conclusion: KG - SMILE可平衡模型有效性与可解释性，促进机器学习技术的透明度和信任度。

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

### [6] [CausalARC: Abstract Reasoning with Causal World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03636)
*Jacqueline Maasch,John Kalantari,Kia Khezeli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CausalARC实验测试平台用于低数据和分布外状态下的AI推理，并展示其在四种语言模型评估场景的应用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理需在有限数据和分布偏移下适应新问题场景，现有缺乏合适测试平台

Method: 构建CausalARC测试平台，每个推理任务从结构因果模型采样，用数据增强提供反馈

Result: 展示CausalARC在四种语言模型评估场景的应用

Conclusion: CausalARC可用于低数据和分布外状态下的AI推理评估

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

*François Olivier,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍了原型神经符号系统Embodied - LM，可让大语言模型基于具身认知结构进行逻辑推理，提升推理效果和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理时易出错，缺乏类似人类的鲁棒心理表征。

Method: 引入Embodied - LM系统，基于图像图式的示意表征进行理解和逻辑推理，在回答集编程中运用声明式空间推理。

Result: 大语言模型能通过具身认知结构解释场景，结构可形式化为可执行程序，所得表征支持有效逻辑推理且可解释性增强。

Conclusion: 当前实现聚焦空间基元，为纳入更复杂动态表征奠定计算基础。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 分析强化学习提升大语言模型推理能力机制，提出HICRA算法，证明聚焦战略瓶颈是关键，验证语义熵测量战略探索优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习提升大语言模型推理能力的机制尚不明确，现行算法存在效率问题。

Method: 分析现象揭示推理层次结构，针对现行算法问题提出HICRA算法，聚焦高影响规划标记。

Result: HICRA算法显著优于基线，证明聚焦战略瓶颈重要性，验证语义熵优势。

Conclusion: 聚焦战略瓶颈对解锁高级推理至关重要，语义熵是测量战略探索的更好指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

### [9] [The Personality Illusion: Revealing Dissociation Between Self-Reports & Behavior in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03730)
*Pengrui Han,Rafal Kocielnik,Peiyang Song,Ramit Debnath,Dean Mobbs,Anima Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究系统刻画大语言模型人格三方面特征，发现指令对齐稳定特征表达，但自报告特征难预测行为，角色注入对行为影响小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究主要依靠简化自报告和启发式提示，缺乏行为验证，需要理解大语言模型中的人格模式。

Method: 从训练阶段特征轮廓的动态出现和演变、自报告特征在行为任务中的预测有效性、针对性干预（如角色注入）对自报告和行为的影响三个维度系统刻画大语言模型人格。

Result: 指令对齐显著稳定特征表达并加强特征相关性；自报告特征不能可靠预测行为；角色注入能引导自报告，但对实际行为影响小或不一致。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了关于大语言模型人格的假设，强调在对齐和可解释性方面需要更深入评估。

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

### [10] [An Empirical Evaluation of Factors Affecting SHAP Explanation of Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03649)
*Davide Italo Serramazza,Nikos Papadeas,Zahraa Abdallah,Georgiana Ifrim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究八种时间序列分割算法对SHAP解释质量的影响，发现段数量比分割方法影响大，等长分割表现优，还引入归一化技术提升归因质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP计算复杂度高，现有特征聚合分割法的最优分割策略未知，需研究分割组成对解释质量的影响。

Method: 研究八种时间序列分割算法，用InterpretTime和AUC Difference评估，在多变量和单变量时间序列上实验，还引入归因归一化技术。

Result: 段数量对解释质量影响大于具体分割方法，等长分割常优于多数自定义分割算法，新归一化技术能提升归因质量。

Conclusion: 段数量是影响解释质量的关键因素，等长分割实用，新归一化技术有效。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

TL;DR: 文章提出PersonaTeaming方法，将身份背景融入自动化红队测试，实验显示攻击成功率提升，还探讨不同类型和方法优劣及未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动化红队测试方法未考虑身份作用，需将人员背景和身份融入自动化红队测试。

Method: 开发PersonaTeaming方法，引入角色进行对抗性提示生成，包括基于特定角色变异提示、动态角色生成算法和新的测量指标。

Result: 与RainbowPlus相比，通过角色变异，对抗性提示攻击成功率最多提升144.1%，同时保持提示多样性。

Conclusion: 讨论不同角色类型和变异方法优缺点，为探索自动化和人工红队测试互补机会提供思路。

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RAGuard及SafetyClamp扩展提升海上风电维护中LLM决策支持的安全性，实验显示能显著提升安全召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型在海上风电维护的专业和意外场景中表现不佳，需提高准确性和安全性。

Method: 引入RAGuard框架，结合安全关键文档与技术手册，并行查询两个索引并分配检索预算；开发SafetyClamp扩展；在多种检索范式下评估技术召回率和安全召回率。

Result: RAGuard和SafetyClamp使安全召回率从近0%提升到超50%，技术召回率保持在60%以上。

Conclusion: RAGuard和SafetyClamp有潜力为关键维护场景中基于大语言模型的决策支持建立新的安全保障标准。

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

Motivation: 评估合成代理能否替代人类受试者，前人关注调查数据对应性，本文探讨基本的内部一致性问题。

Result: 不同模型家族和大小的LLMs都存在显著内部不一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs虽能生成与人类匹配的回复，但内部不一致，难以准确替代人类受试者。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

Motivation: 现有多智能体大语言模型系统固定协作协议有效性受限，忽略智能体内部审议能力。

Method: 引入MPDF让智能体学习关于元认知行动的分散策略，开发SoftRankPO强化学习算法稳定训练。

Result: MPDF与SoftRankPO在五个数学和通用推理基准测试中，相比六种先进算法平均准确率有4 - 5%的绝对提升。

Conclusion: 为多智能体大语言模型系统提供学习自适应、元认知策略的范式，从设计固定协议转向学习动态审议策略。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

Motivation: OMOP CDM数据标准化中术语映射资源密集且易出错，大语言模型有潜力但有幻觉问题，需有效方法。

Method: 开发基于Model Context Protocol (MCP)的零训练、防幻觉映射系统。

Result: 系统实现可解释映射，提高效率和准确性，提供实时词汇查询和结构化推理输出。

Conclusion: 该系统适用于探索和生产环境，能有效促进OMOP CDM数据标准化。

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

Motivation: 传统探索方法在连续细胞自动机中发现多样视觉模式时存在局限，易陷入局部新颖性而无法探索远处区域。

Method: 引入Expedition and Expansion (E&E)混合策略，交替进行局部新颖性驱动扩展和目标导向探索，利用视觉语言模型生成语言目标。

Result: 在Flow Lenia上测试，E&E比现有方法发现更多样的解决方案，且来自探索阶段的解决方案对长期探索影响更大。

Conclusion: E&E能突破局部新颖性边界，以符合人类认知的可解释方式探索行为空间，为人工生命等领域的开放式探索提供了有前景的模板。

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

Conclusion: 研究推动了胸部X光解读医学基础模型向全面、透明和临床可行方向发展。

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

Motivation: 现有方法将控制参数作为嵌入式约束，未将其视为搜索空间的决策点，需提出新方法。

Method: 开发最佳优先启发式搜索算法，利用延迟部分扩展概念。

Result: 该新颖搜索算法是解决含控制参数规划问题现有方法的有力替代。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在处理含控制参数规划问题上有优势。

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFWorld基准测试中，WorMI在多个未见领域的零样本和少样本性能优于几种基于大语言模型的方法。

Conclusion: WorMI框架在具身代理场景中具有可扩展的、实际部署的潜力，适应能力和数据效率至关重要。

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

Method: 引入MPR框架，将LLM生成的反思整合到结构化的元策略内存（MPM），通过软内存引导解码和硬规则可接受性检查两种机制应用该内存，形式化MPM表示，给出更新和解码算法。

Result: 在基于AlfWorld的文本代理环境实验中，相比Reflexion基线，执行准确性和鲁棒性有持续提升，规则可接受性进一步提高稳定性。

Conclusion: MPR有效，分析了提升原因，讨论了可扩展性和失败模式，并指出多模态和多智能体扩展的未来方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的AutoPBO框架自动优化PBO局部搜索求解器，实验显示其性能有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PBO局部搜索求解器的启发式设计需大量专家精力和手动调优，大语言模型在自动算法设计有潜力但未应用于PBO求解器优化。

Method: 引入AutoPBO框架，在四个公开基准测试上实验，并与六个最先进的求解器对比。

Result: AutoPBO较之前局部搜索方法有显著改进，与最先进竞争对手性能相当。

Conclusion: AutoPBO为自动设计局部搜索求解器提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

Conclusion: 该框架为未来开发更有效、更具通用性的推理代理提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

Method: 在三个数据集和七个大语言模型上对比四种正式语言。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文结合强化学习与搜索式路径规划器加速客机航线优化，可在紧急时快速重算航线，虽不保证全局最优，但能提升计算速度且燃油消耗相近。

Motivation: 在客机紧急情况下实现快速航线重计算，加速飞行路径优化。

Method: 训练强化学习代理基于位置和大气数据预计算近似最优路径，运行时用其约束路径规划求解器。

Result: 有效减少求解器搜索空间，计算速度相比传统求解器最多提升50%，燃油消耗与无约束求解器相近，偏差通常在1%以内。

Conclusion: 结合强化学习和搜索式路径规划器能显著加速航线优化，在燃油消耗影响小的情况下提升计算速度。

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

Motivation: 随着AI发展，探讨AI是否会成为超越人类的“数字物种”并领导宇宙。

Method: 分析人类与AI的差异，强调中枢神经系统的作用及伦理体系的构建。

Result: AI虽在多方面能力可能超人类，但因缺乏中枢神经系统，无法发展可持续伦理体系。

Conclusion: 宇宙领导权的最佳基础是DNA而非硅，AI难以超越人类。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

Our approach enables precise, modular modeling of complex culinary workflows.

TL;DR: 研究马尔可夫逻辑网络（MLN）在定义域大小趋于无穷时随机结构的性质，通过三类例子分析极限行为，还比较了MLN与提升贝叶斯网络并对比MLN分布和均匀分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MLN确定的概率分布在定义域大小趋于无穷时的性质。

Method: 考虑三类具体的MLN例子，分别是单关系符号无量词MLN、少三角形图的MLN、少高度数顶点图的MLN，并进行分析。

Result: 对第一类例子给出随机结构极限行为的完整刻画；第二类例子得到一阶逻辑的近似0 - 1律；不同软约束下随机结构极限行为不同，软约束权重影响不定；证明无量词MLN和提升贝叶斯网络渐近不可比；大定义域上MLN分布概率集中区域与均匀分布不同。

Conclusion: MLN的软约束和权重对随机结构极限行为有不同影响，且MLN分布与均匀分布在大定义域上差异明显。

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型代理在谈判中忽视情绪功能，易被对手操纵和利用，需优化。

Method: 将情绪状态转换建模为马尔可夫决策过程，采用基于种群的遗传优化在不同谈判场景中进化高回报情绪策略，提出含两个基线的评估框架。

Result: EvoEmo始终优于两个基线，成功率更高、效率更高且买家节省更多。

Conclusion: 自适应情绪表达对实现更有效的多轮谈判大语言模型代理很重要。

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero通常假设测试时神经网络训练的环境不变，限制了其适用性，需解决在潜在变化测试环境中的部署问题。

Method: 对AlphaZero标准框架进行简单修改。

Result: 在低规划预算设置下，简单修改标准框架能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 对标准框架的简单修改可有效提升AlphaZero在潜在变化测试环境中的性能。

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

Method: 借助MBTI，通过提示工程为智能体赋予不同人格原型，控制其认知和情感行为；集成16Personalities测试确保特质持久；还可推广到其他心理框架。

Result: 人格启动使智能体在不同任务中有一致、可解释的行为偏差；支持结构化多智能体通信实验，互动前的自我反思可提高合作和推理质量。

Conclusion: 建立了无需微调、基于心理学增强AI智能体的基础。

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型推理痕迹在上下文窗口重置后会被丢弃，外部记忆虽有好处，但基于实例的记忆条目复用性和扩展性不足，因此想转向概念级记忆。

Method: 设计从推理过程中提取概念、为新查询检索条目的新策略，将相关概念选择性地检索并集成到提示中，实现测试时持续学习且无需更新权重。

Result: 在ARC - AGI基准测试中，相对无记忆基线有7.5%的相对增益，性能随推理计算量增加而提升，抽象概念记忆设计表现最佳，测试时动态更新记忆效果更好。

Conclusion: 概念级记忆可使大语言模型记忆更具复用性和扩展性，动态更新记忆能实现自我提升。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Motivation: 高阶导数在多种算法中是关键，需高效计算格林函数高阶导数的方法。

Method: 提供混合符号 - 数值程序生成递推式，利用其计算导数；提出基于旋转的目标特定QBX评估新方法。

Result: 算法误差可控且理论上可理解，新的QBX评估方法成本显著低于现有符号方法。

Conclusion: 数值实验支持了所提方法在准确性和成本方面的优势。

Abstract: High-order derivatives of Green's functions are a key ingredient in
Taylor-based fast multipole methods, Barnes-Hut $n$-body algorithms, and
quadrature by expansion (QBX). In these settings, derivatives underpin either
the formation, evaluation, and/or translation of Taylor expansions.
  In this article, we provide hybrid symbolic-numerical procedures that
generate recurrences to attain an $O(n)$ cost for the the computation of $n$
derivatives (i.e. $O(1)$ per derivative) for arbitrary radially symmetric
Green's functions. These procedures are general--only requiring knowledge of
the PDE that the Green's function solves. We show that the algorithm has
controlled, theoretically-understood error.
  We apply these methods to the method of quadrature by expansion, a method for
the evaluation of singular layer potentials, which requires higher-order
derivatives of Green's functions. In doing so, we contribute a new
rotation-based method for target-specific QBX evaluation in the Cartesian
setting that attains dramatically lower cost than existing symbolic approaches.
  Numerical experiments support our claims of accuracy and cost.

Abstract: Chronic obesity management requires continuous monitoring of energy balance

Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Daily Living. Validated on the WISDM-Smart
dataset with 51 subjects performing 18 activities, COBRA's optimal
preprocessing strategy combines spectral-temporal feature extraction, achieving
high performance across multiple architectures. D-Net demonstrates 96.86%
overall accuracy with category-specific F1-scores of 98.55% (Physical
Activity), 95.53% (Food Intake), 94.63% (Sedentary Behavior), and 98.68% (Daily
Living), outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 1.18% in accuracy. The
framework shows robust generalizability with low demographic variance (<3%),

Conclusion: 可通过数据科学语言解读和现成ETL工具实现新图挑战并获得显著软件加速，无需特定HPC代码。

Abstract: The HPEC Graph Challenge is a collection of benchmarks representing complex
workloads that test the hardware and software components of HPC systems, which
traditional benchmarks, such as LINPACK, do not. The first benchmark, Subgraph
Isomorphism, focused on several compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. The
most recent of the challenges, the Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge,
represents a shift in direction, as it represents a longer end-to-end workload
that requires many more software components, including, but not limited to,
data I/O, data structures for representing graph data, and a wide range of
functions for data preparation and network analysis. A notable feature of this
new graph challenge is the use of GraphBLAS to represent the computational
aspects of the problem statement. In this paper, we show an alternative
interpretation of the GraphBLAS formulations using the language of data
science. With this formulation, we show that the new graph challenge can be
implemented using off-the-shelf ETL tools available in open-source, enterprise
software such as NVIDIA's RAPIDS ecosystem. Using off-the-shelf software,
RAPIDS cuDF and cupy, we enable significant software acceleration without
requiring any specific HPC code and show speedups, over the same code running
with Pandas on the CPU, of 147x-509x on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, 243x-1269X for an
NVIDIA H100 GPU, and 332X-2185X for an NVIDIA H200 GPU.

Conclusion: 本文是首个在异步通信网络中解决下载问题的工作。

Abstract: The distributedData Retrieval (DR) model consists of $k$ peers connected by a
complete peer-to-peer communication network, and a trusted external data source
that stores an array $\textbf{X}$ of $n$ bits ($n \gg k$). Up to $\beta k$ of
the peers might fail in any execution (for $\beta \in [0, 1)$). Peers can
obtain the information either by inexpensive messages passed among themselves
or through expensive queries to the source array $\textbf{X}$. In the DR model,
we focus on designing protocols that minimize the number of queries performed
by any nonfaulty peer (a measure referred to as query complexity) while
maximizing the resilience parameter $\beta$.
  The Download problem requires each nonfaulty peer to correctly learn the
entire array $\textbf{X}$. Earlier work on this problem focused on synchronous
communication networks and established several deterministic and randomized
upper and lower bounds. Our work is the first to extend the study of
distributed data retrieval to asynchronous communication networks. We address
the Download problem under both the Byzantine and crash failure models. We
present query-optimal deterministic solutions in an asynchronous model that can
tolerate any fixed fraction $\beta<1$ of crash faults. In the Byzantine failure
model, it is known that deterministic protocols incur a query complexity of
$\Omega(n)$ per peer, even under synchrony. We extend this lower bound to
randomized protocols in the asynchronous model for $\beta \geq 1/2$, and
further show that for $\beta < 1/2$, a randomized protocol exists with
near-optimal query complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first

Abstract: This work addresses the gathering problem for a set of autonomous, anonymous,
and homogeneous robots with limited visibility operating in a continuous
circle. The robots are initially placed at distinct positions, forming a
rotationally asymmetric configuration. The robots agree on the clockwise
direction. In the $\theta$-visibility model, a robot can only see those robots
on the circle that are at an angular distance $<\theta$ from it. Di Luna
\textit{et. al.} [DISC'20] have shown that, in $\pi/2$ visibility, gathering is
impossible. In addition, they provided an algorithm for robots with $\pi$
visibility, operating under a semi-synchronous scheduler. In the $\pi$
visibility model, only one point, the point at the angular distance $\pi$ is
removed from the visibility. Ghosh \textit{et. al.} [SSS'23] provided a
gathering algorithm for $\pi$ visibility model with robot having finite memory
($\mathcal{FSTA}$), operating under a special asynchronous scheduler.
  If the robots can see all points on the circle, then the gathering can be
done by electing a leader in the weakest robot model under a fully asynchronous
scheduler. However, previous works have shown that even the removal of one
point from the visibility makes gathering difficult. In both works, the robots
had rigid movement. In this work, we propose an algorithm that solves the
gathering problem under the $\pi$-visibility model for robots that have finite
communication ability ($\mathcal{FCOM}$). In this work the robot movement is
non-rigid and the robots work under a fully asynchronous scheduler.

Motivation: 含倦怠变量的大规模系统模拟假设情景计算需求大，现有顺序处理扩展性不佳，如在线广告中因预算问题使反事实分析复杂

Method: 引入基于不确定性松弛的新型算法

Result: 能实现高效并行计算

Conclusion: 新算法显著提高含倦怠变量系统反事实估计的可扩展性

Abstract: We consider large-scale systems influenced by burnout variables - state
variables that start active, shape dynamics, and irreversibly deactivate once
certain conditions are met. Simulating what-if scenarios in such systems is
computationally demanding, as alternative trajectories often require sequential
processing, which does not scale very well. This challenge arises in settings
like online advertising, because of campaigns budgets, complicating
counterfactual analysis despite rich data availability. We introduce a new type
of algorithms based on what we refer to as uncertainty relaxation, that enables
efficient parallel computation, significantly improving scalability for
counterfactual estimation in systems with burnout variables.

Result: 在各种工作负载实验中，LowDiff能实现每次迭代的检查点频率，运行时开销小于3.1%。

Conclusion: LowDiff是一种高效的频繁检查点框架，可有效降低分布式训练中频繁检查点的成本。

Abstract: Distributed training of large deep-learning models often leads to failures,
so checkpointing is commonly employed for recovery. State-of-the-art studies
focus on frequent checkpointing for fast recovery from failures. However, it
generates numerous checkpoints, incurring substantial costs and thus degrading
training performance. Recently, differential checkpointing has been proposed to
reduce costs, but it is limited to recommendation systems, so its application
to general distributed training systems remains unexplored.
  This paper proposes LowDiff, an efficient frequent checkpointing framework
that \textit{reuses} compressed gradients, serving as differential checkpoints
to reduce cost. Furthermore, LowDiff incorporates a batched gradient write
optimization to persist these differentials to storage efficiently. It also
dynamically tunes both the checkpoint frequency and the batching size to
maximize performance. We further enhance LowDiff with a layer-wise gradient
reusing and snapshotting approach and a CPU-based asynchronous persistence
strategy, enabling frequent checkpointing without gradient compression.
Experiments on various workloads show that LowDiff can achieve checkpointing
frequency up to per iteration with less than 3.1\% runtime overhead.

Conclusion: 无限计算能力（除有限时间外）对同步机器人在有限图上的算法有显著影响。

Abstract: The OBLOT model has been extensively studied in theoretical swarm robotics.
It assumes weak capabilities for the involved mobile robots, such as they are
anonymous, disoriented, no memory of past events (oblivious), and silent. Their
only means of (implicit) communication is transferred to their positioning,
i.e., stigmergic information. These limited capabilities make the design of
distributed algorithms a challenging task. Over the last two decades, numerous
research papers have addressed the question of which tasks can be accomplished
within this model. Nevertheless, as it usually happens in distributed
computing, also in OBLOT the computational power available to the robots is
neglected as the main cost measures for the designed algorithms refer to the
number of movements or the number of rounds required. In this paper, we prove
that for synchronous robots moving on finite graphs, the unlimited
computational power (other than finite time) has a significant impact. In fact,
by exploiting it, we provide a definitive resolution algorithm that applies to
a wide class of problems while guaranteeing the minimum number of moves and
rounds.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the hypothesis selection problem, we are given a finite set of candidate
distributions (hypotheses), $\mathcal{H} = \{H_1, \ldots, H_n\}$, and samples
from an unknown distribution $P$. Our goal is to find a hypothesis $H_i$ whose
total variation distance to $P$ is comparable to that of the nearest hypothesis
in $\mathcal{H}$. If the minimum distance is $\mathsf{OPT}$, we aim to output
an $H_i$ such that, with probability at least $1-\delta$, its total variation
distance to $P$ is at most $C \cdot \mathsf{OPT} + \varepsilon$.
  Despite decades of work, key aspects of this problem remain unresolved,
including the optimal running time for algorithms that achieve the optimal
sample complexity and best possible approximation factor of $C=3$. The previous
state-of-the-art result [Aliakbarpour, Bun, Smith, NeurIPS 2024] provided a
nearly linear in $n$ time algorithm but with a sub-optimal dependence on the
other parameters, running in $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta^3\varepsilon^3))$ time. We
improve this time complexity to $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta \varepsilon^2))$,
significantly reducing the dependence on the confidence and error parameters.
  Furthermore, we study hypothesis selection in three alternative settings,
resolving or making progress on several open questions from prior works. (1) We
settle the optimal approximation factor when bounding the \textit{expected
distance} of the output hypothesis, rather than its high-probability
performance. (2) Assuming the numerical value of \textit{$\mathsf{OPT}$ is
known} in advance, we present an algorithm obtaining $C=3$ and runtime
$\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ with the optimal sample complexity and succeeding
with high probability in $n$. (3) Allowing polynomial \textit{preprocessing}
step on the hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ before observing samples, we present
an algorithm with $C=3$ and subquadratic runtime which succeeds with high
probability in $n$.

Method: 将信任形式化为重复博弈中的认知捷径，考虑基于信任的策略并系统分析其在两人对称社会困境博弈空间中的演化。

Result: 当检查行为是否合作成本高时，基于信任的策略能胜过标准互惠策略，且信任能增加群体合作水平，即使存在利用信任的策略。

Conclusion: 使用信任启发式对个体有适应益处，为信任如何促进不同社会互动中的合作提供了形式化理论，并探讨了对人类与人工智能互动的影响。

Abstract: Trust is often thought to increase cooperation. However, game-theoretic
models often fail to distinguish between cooperative behaviour and trust. This
makes it difficult to measure trust and determine its effect in different
social dilemmas. We address this here by formalising trust as a cognitive
shortcut in repeated games. This functions by avoiding checking a partner's
actions once a threshold level of cooperativeness has been observed. We
consider trust-based strategies that implement this heuristic, and
systematically analyse their evolution across the space of two-player symmetric
social dilemma games. We find that where it is costly to check whether another
agent's actions were cooperative, as is the case in many real-world settings,
then trust-based strategies can outcompete standard reciprocal strategies such
as Tit-for-Tat in many social dilemmas. Moreover, the presence of trust
increases the overall level of cooperation in the population, especially in
cases where agents can make unintentional errors in their actions. This occurs
even in the presence of strategies designed to build and then exploit trust.
Overall, our results demonstrate the individual adaptive benefit to an agent of
using a trust heuristic, and provide a formal theory for how trust can promote
cooperation in different types of social interaction. We discuss the
implications of this for interactions between humans and artificial
intelligence agents.

Motivation: 解决推荐系统在确保次要目标满足最低阈值（护栏）时，因系统变化难以执行且需手动调参的问题。

Result: 通过实证证明了ACT的有效性。

Conclusion: ACT框架能自动找到最小超参数更改集以满足护栏要求，可应用于大规模生产环境。

Abstract: Recommender systems often must maximize a primary objective while ensuring
secondary ones satisfy minimum thresholds, or "guardrails." This is critical
for maintaining a consistent user experience and platform ecosystem, but
enforcing these guardrails despite orthogonal system changes is challenging and
often requires manual hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Automated
Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework, which automatically finds the minimal set
of hyperparameter changes needed to satisfy these guardrails. ACT uses an
offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find solutions and continuously
retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes. We empirically
demonstrate its efficacy and describe its deployment in a large-scale
production environment.

Conclusion: 该方法是在线实验的经济有效替代方案，离线实验有增益，待实时流量实验验证。

Abstract: Recommender and search systems commonly rely on Learning To Rank models
trained on logged user interactions to order items by predicted relevance.
However, such interaction data is often subject to position bias, as users are
more likely to click on items that appear higher in the ranking, regardless of
their actual relevance. As a result, newly trained models may inherit and
reinforce the biases of prior ranking models rather than genuinely improving
relevance. A standard approach to mitigate position bias is Inverse Propensity
Scoring (IPS), where the model's loss is weighted by the inverse of a
propensity function, an estimate of the probability that an item at a given
position is examined. However, accurate propensity estimation is challenging,
especially in interfaces with complex non-linear layouts. In this paper, we
propose a novel method for estimating position bias using Large Language Models
(LLMs) applied to logged user interaction data. This approach offers a
cost-effective alternative to online experimentation. Our experiments show that
propensities estimated with our LLM-as-a-judge approach are stable across score
buckets and reveal the row-column effects of Viator's grid layout that simpler
heuristics overlook. An IPS-weighted reranker trained with these propensities
matches the production model on standard NDCG@10 while improving weighted
NDCG@10 by roughly 2%. We will verify these offline gains in forthcoming
live-traffic experiments.

Result: 在亚马逊购物数据集上提升推荐质量（Recall和NDCG），推理效率提高5 - 14倍。

Conclusion: 提供与其他流行方法不同的效率视角，有望启发研究，为ID集成到LLM开辟新方向。

Abstract: Integrating product catalogs and user behavior into LLMs can enhance
recommendations with broad world knowledge, but the scale of real-world item
catalogs, often containing millions of discrete item identifiers (Item IDs),
poses a significant challenge. This contrasts with the smaller, tokenized text
vocabularies typically used in LLMs. The predominant view within the LLM-based
recommendation literature is that it is infeasible to treat item ids as a first
class citizen in the LLM and instead some sort of tokenization of an item into
multiple tokens is required. However, this creates a key practical bottleneck
in serving these models for real-time low-latency applications.
  Our paper challenges this predominant practice and integrates item ids as
first class citizens into the LLM. We provide simple, yet highly effective,
novel training and inference modifications that enable single-token
representations of items and single-step decoding. Our method shows
improvements in recommendation quality (Recall and NDCG) over existing
techniques on the Amazon shopping datasets while significantly improving
inference efficiency by 5x-14x. Our work offers an efficiency perspective
distinct from that of other popular approaches within LLM-based recommendation,
potentially inspiring further research and opening up a new direction for
integrating IDs into LLMs. Our code is available here

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的方法能带来更高质量的相关性指标。

Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to
ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human
annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost
and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our
approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online
experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between
LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can
provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving
the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the
opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and
efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach
leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum
Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiment measurements.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github
repository.

Conclusion: 为大语言模型内表示选择提供实证支持，展示了可扩展、无模式实体检索的实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER
Retriever Codebase is publicly available at

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Technical-Embeddings, a novel framework designed
to optimize semantic retrieval in technical documentation, with applications in
both hardware and software development. Our approach addresses the challenges
of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by
generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve
dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding
models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential
contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To
further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model
using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries
and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our
approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that
Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both
precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating
query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and
comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for
efficient and accurate technical document retrieval in engineering and product

*Tian Miao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出TIMGen模型解决基于静态兴趣偏好的个性化内容生成策略的不足，能灵活动态建模用户多模态兴趣，可用于多种场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户兴趣动态演变和互联网应用多模态需求增加，基于静态兴趣偏好的个性化内容生成策略难以满足实际需求。

Method: TIMGen模型对用户兴趣的长期时间演变建模，捕捉有强时间依赖的动态兴趣表示，支持多模态特征融合，联合学习时间依赖和模态偏好以获得统一兴趣表示。

Result: 克服基于静态偏好的个性化内容推荐方法的缺点，能灵活动态建模用户多模态兴趣，更好理解和捕捉其兴趣偏好。

Conclusion: 模型可扩展到多种实际应用场景，为未来研究提供见解。

Abstract: With the dynamic evolution of user interests and the increasing multimodal
demands in internet applications, personalized content generation strategies
based on static interest preferences struggle to meet practical application
requirements. The proposed TIMGen (Temporal Interest-driven Multimodal
Generation) model addresses this challenge by modeling the long-term temporal
evolution of users' interests and capturing dynamic interest representations
with strong temporal dependencies. This model also supports the fusion of
multimodal features, such as text, images, video, and audio, and delivers
customized content based on multimodal preferences. TIMGen jointly learns
temporal dependencies and modal preferences to obtain a unified interest
representation, which it then generates to meet users' personalized content
needs. TIMGen overcomes the shortcomings of personalized content recommendation
methods based on static preferences, enabling flexible and dynamic modeling of
users' multimodal interests, better understanding and capturing their interests
and preferences. It can be extended to a variety of practical application
scenarios, including e-commerce, advertising, online education, and precision
medicine, providing insights for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为Pinterest有效提供个性化推荐和广告，需要从多样数据源构建用户和物品嵌入。

Method: 采用上下游范式框架，上游模型在多数据源上训练，学习并定期更新实体嵌入，下游将嵌入作为特征用于多个任务。

Result: 框架在离线和在线设置的下游任务中性能显著提升，已部署到Pinterest生产广告排序系统。

Conclusion: 该框架有效，能提升性能并带来在线指标的显著增长。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework following an
upstream-downstream paradigm to construct user and item (Pin) embeddings from
diverse data sources, which are essential for Pinterest to deliver personalized
Pins and ads effectively. Our upstream models are trained on extensive data
sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture
intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure
scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and
regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for
asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These
embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks,
including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We
demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in
both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This
framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems,
resulting in significant gains in online metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全局到局部的图像检索范式受限于局部匹配计算成本，新兴高效局部特征搜索带来新可能，需探索新检索范式。

Method: 提出局部到全局的检索范式，基于局部特征检索相似度动态计算全局特征进行重排，利用多维缩放技术创建嵌入。

Result: 在Revisited Oxford和Paris数据集上取得新的最优结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的局部到全局检索范式及重排方法有效，能提升检索性能。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

TL;DR: 提出一类新的神经网络优化器，在低维示例中有效，理论性质佳，可改进现有预条件方法，复杂度与Adam相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用损失景观嵌入高维空间时自然诱导的黎曼度量，开发新的神经网络优化器。

Method: 从几何角度出发，使用诱导度量开发新优化器，并与SGD、Adam等现有方法在不同任务和架构上进行对比。

Result: 新优化器在低维示例中非常有效，相比现有方法有轻微提升，具有理论上的理想性质，基本方法可修改现有预条件方法，计算复杂度与Adam相当。

Conclusion: 新的一类优化器在训练神经网络方面表现良好，尤其在低维情况，有理论优势且可与现有方法结合。

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

TL;DR: 提出用于电子健康记录（EHR）数据的通用基础模型CEHR - GPT，统一三项能力，表现良好且通用性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数EHR的AI模型用于单一任务，泛化性和实用性受限，需要通用模型。

Method: 提出CEHR - GPT模型，采用基于时间标记的学习框架将患者动态时间线编码到模型结构中。

Result: CEHR - GPT在三项任务中表现出色，通过词汇扩展和微调可有效泛化到外部数据集。

Conclusion: CEHR - GPT通用性强，无需特定任务的重新训练，可实现快速模型开发、队列发现和患者结果预测。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

*Lucas Lopes Felipe,Konstantin Avrachenkov,Daniel Sadoc Menasche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从博弈论角度研究CPM进行社区检测，展示其效率、鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据科学中社区检测问题，突显CPM在分区网络为不相交社区方面的优势。

Method: 将CPM重新解释为潜在享乐博弈，分解全局哈密顿量为局部效用函数；引入两种稳定性标准；在社区跟踪场景中结合初始分区和Leiden算法。

Result: 证明通过更好响应动态的CPM目标局部优化在伪多项式时间内收敛到平衡分区；实验表明鲁棒分区在恢复真实社区方面有更高准确性。

Conclusion: 从博弈论角度看，CPM在社区检测中具有效率、鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索NMF和PCC这两个概念之间的紧密联系并挖掘其应用价值。

Method: 对灰度图像数据集进行研究，利用PCC为NMF有效秩提供预测工具，用NMF近似实现PCC。

Result: PCC使NMF有效秩估计更稳定，NMF在该秩下特征稳定；NMF可近似实现PCC，还能用于聚类和数据去噪。

Conclusion: NMF和PCC相互关联且在数据处理中有重要应用。

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

Result: 在模拟场景和真实世界的空间出租车定价问题实验中，所提方法优于现有平均场博弈中的逆强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法在处理异质目标演示的奖励推断上具有优势。

Abstract: Designing suitable reward functions for numerous interacting intelligent
agents is challenging in real-world applications. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端受能源和可用性预算限制，有效选择参与训练的客户端对全局模型收敛和客户端贡献平衡至关重要。

Method: 设置三种影响时间序列数据可用性的场景，提出FedDeCAB方法，在客户端与服务器断开连接时从最近邻客户端获取部分模型参数进行联合优化。

Result: 基于真实大规模出租车和船舶轨迹数据集的实验表明，FedDeCAB在高度异构数据分布、有限通信预算以及客户端动态离线或重新加入的情况下有效。

Conclusion: FedDeCAB方法能提高离线模型性能，减少通信开销，在复杂场景下有良好表现。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

Motivation: Uniform - reward RLHF无法捕捉子群体意见多样性，MaxMin - RLHF在最小奖励组为少数群体时表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 提出SharedRep - RLHF框架，学习和利用各群体注释中的共享特征，而非为各群体单独学习奖励模型；证明MaxMin - RLHF在学习共享特征上的次优性并量化SharedRep - RLHF的样本复杂度。

Result: 在多种自然语言任务实验中，SharedRep - RLHF相比MaxMin - RLHF胜率最高提升20%。

Conclusion: SharedRep - RLHF框架有效，能解决MaxMin - RLHF的局限。

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Conclusion: 直接跟踪梯度动态很重要，有助于缩小理论预期和实证行为的差距，为未来优化研究提供见解。

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse
modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

TL;DR: 提出新SNE算法EmbedOR，能解决现有算法不能保留高维噪声数据几何结构的问题，实验证明其效果好，还可用于标注可视化结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNE算法（如UMAP和tSNE）在可视化高维噪声数据时不能保留几何结构，会错误分离数据子流形的连通分量，找不到可聚类数据的簇。

Method: 提出EmbedOR算法，它结合离散图曲率，使用增强曲率的距离度量随机嵌入数据。

Result: EmbedOR距离度量将tSNE的一致性结果扩展到更广泛的数据集；实验表明EmbedOR在可视化和保留几何结构方面表现出色，不太可能分割数据的连续高密度区域。

Conclusion: EmbedOR能解决现有SNE算法的局限性，其距离度量可用于标注现有可视化结果，深入洞察数据的底层几何结构。

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

Conclusion: 加深对缺失数据下探索 - 利用权衡的理解，指导高效顺序测试策略设计。

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

<details>

Motivation: 强大的开源大语言模型催生大量微调模型，但因元数据不一致和仓库非结构化，难以导航和理解这些模型。

Method: 引入Delta Activations方法，通过测量微调模型相对于基础模型内部激活的变化，将其表示为向量嵌入。

Result: 该方法能按领域和任务有效聚类模型，具有鲁棒性和加法属性，可通过少样本微调嵌入任务，还可用于模型选择和合并。

Conclusion: Delta Activations方法有助于复用公开可用模型。

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 范围划分熵在算法设计有优势，但未用于深度学习，需让其可用于深度学习。

Method: 提出范围划分熵的可微近似，设计EntropyNet模块，将熵正则化应用于Transformer注意力。

Result: 在几何任务中实现4.1倍运行加速且误差小；在深度学习中，80%稀疏度下准确率比L1基线高6%。

Conclusion: 熵有界计算不仅理论优雅，也是自适应学习、效率和结构化表示的实用机制。

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy, a recent
concept from computational geometry that enables algorithms to adapt to the
"sortedness" of their input. While range-partition entropy provides strong
guarantees in algorithm design, it has not yet been made accessible to deep
learning. In this work, we (i) propose the first differentiable approximation
of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

Conclusion: 提出的问题表述和方法可跨SatML应用领域推广，在多哥农业调查中有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

Motivation: 私家车保有量增长使城市停车困境加剧，现有停车可用性预测方法在建模时空依赖和利用多源数据方面有局限。

Method: 用K - means聚类建立停车集群区，提取整合多交通模式交通需求特征；升级iTransformer得到SST - iTransformer，集成基于掩码重建的自监督时空表征学习和双分支注意力机制。

Result: SST - iTransformer优于基线模型，达到最优性能；明确不同数据源重要性，排除相关停车场历史数据会导致性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: SST - iTransformer在停车可用性预测方面表现出色，建模空间依赖和利用多源数据很重要。

Abstract: The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking
predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking
availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address
key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting
multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a
novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means
clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and
integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes
(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted
parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates
masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal
representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention
mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via
patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions
through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep
learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and
iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean
squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive
ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different
data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance
gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)
contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that
excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to
substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling
spatial dependencies.

Conclusion: 所提出的数据驱动方法在近似光滑流形上实值函数方面表现良好，具有更好的准确性和效率。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

Conclusion: 对抗性共同进化是学习工具性世界模型、提升智能体战略深度和鲁棒性的强大方法。

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

Conclusion: 结构奖励学习是有前景的新范式，对机器人、医疗等领域有直接影响。

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural
reward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for
robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.

Conclusion: 所提出的更新潜在因素特征表示和ADAPT - Z方法有效，能提升时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

Method: 提出轻量级、即插即用的BEV注入连接器，构建环境BEV并与自车输入融合；开发结合CARLA模拟器和MATLAB射线追踪的联合仿真环境生成数据。

Result: 该框架在所有任务中性能稳定提升，相比仅自车基线，宏观平均准确率指标最多提高13.9%，在恶劣条件下性能增益最多达32.7%。

Conclusion: 提出的BEV注入框架性能好，在不利环境下具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MTS预测方法常忽略多分组尺度的超前 - 滞后依赖，无法捕捉复杂系统的分层超前 - 滞后效应。

Method: 提出MillGNN，包含特定尺度的超前 - 滞后图学习模块和分层超前 - 滞后消息传递模块。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，MillGNN在长短期MTS预测上优于16种先进方法。

Conclusion: MillGNN在MTS预测中表现出色，能有效捕捉多尺度超前 - 滞后效应。

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该模型为冠心病提供了高度准确和可靠的无创诊断工具。

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and
contributes significantly to annual healthcare expenditures. To develop a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, we designed a model based on a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, trained on 50 key urinary peptide biomarkers
selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising
345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation
strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,
respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results
indicate that the model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive
diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease.

Result: 在四个蛋白质表示学习任务上，TCPNet始终优于最先进的几何图神经网络。

Conclusion: 该方法在需要理解二级结构排列的任务中表现出色，验证了层次拓扑特征对蛋白质分析的重要性。

Abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding
structure-function relationships, yet current sequence- and graph-based methods
fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures.
We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to
complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level.
TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often
requiring significant human and material resources. Embedding a hybrid AI-based
system for fault detection directly in the satellite can greatly reduce this
burden by allowing earlier detection. However, such systems must operate with
extremely high reliability. To ensure this level of dependability, we employ
the formal verification tool Marabou to verify the local robustness of the
neural network models used in the AI-based algorithm. This tool allows us to
quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior
becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its
performance under uncertainty.

Conclusion: 通过所提方法使机器学习模型与临床经验学习对齐是可行的，模型预测差异会影响临床解释。

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

Conclusion: FedQuad方法能有效解决联邦学习中的数据异质性问题，度量学习策略在联邦学习表征学习中有效。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

Motivation: 现有共形反事实推理（CCI）方法常产生过于保守的区间，特别是在处理不平衡时反事实样本稀缺。

Method: 引入合成数据驱动的CCI（SP - CCI）框架，用预训练反事实模型生成的合成反事实标签扩充校准集，基于风险控制预测集（RCPS）将合成样本纳入共形校准程序并结合预测驱动推理（PPI）进行去偏。

Result: 证明SP - CCI在精确和近似重要性加权下能在保持边际覆盖率的同时获得更窄的预测区间，不同数据集的实验结果表明SP - CCI在所有设置下相比标准CCI持续缩小区间宽度。

Conclusion: SP - CCI框架在构建个体反事实结果可靠预测区间方面有效，能在保证覆盖率的同时缩小区间宽度。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于社会负担的公平框架和MISOB算法在保证分类器准确性的同时，能有效降低各群体的社会负担，解决算法追索中的公平性问题。

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

Result: 得到了AFA注意力机制，在特定条件下可恢复普通点积注意力。

Conclusion: 提出的AFA机制是一种有效的注意力机制，具有与标准注意力相同的计算和内存复杂度。

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient

Method: 引入两种新攻击方法，即对多元LiRA的适配和深度时间序列（DTS）攻击，并与分类场景中其他攻击方法的适配版本进行基准测试。在TUH - EEG和ELD数据集上，针对LSTM和N - HiTS架构，在记录级和用户级威胁模型下评估。

Result: 预测模型易受攻击，用户级攻击常能完美检测，提出的方法在多个场景中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 为时间序列预测中的隐私风险评估建立了新基线，且模型漏洞随预测时长增加和训练样本量减少而增大。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

decreases exponentially with depth; we further extend the result to spectral
polynomial filters and provide a short proof for the Leaky-ReLU case.

TL;DR: 介绍Set Block Decoding (SBD)加速语言模型生成的方法，可减少前向传播次数且不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型推理计算和内存成本高，尤其是解码阶段，需加速生成。

Method: 提出SBD范式，在单一架构中集成标准下一个令牌预测(NTP)和掩码令牌预测(MATP)，允许并行采样多个未来令牌，利用离散扩散文献中的高级求解器，微调现有NTP模型实现。

Result: 微调Llama - 3.1 8B和Qwen - 3 8B，SBD使生成所需的前向传播次数减少3 - 5倍，且性能与等效NTP训练相同。

Conclusion: SBD是一种简单灵活的加速语言模型生成的方法，无需架构更改和额外训练超参数，能在不牺牲准确性的情况下显著提速。

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

TL;DR: 提出ZooCast利用时间序列基础模型互补能力，在零样本预测基准测试表现好，能无缝添加新模型提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同时间序列基础模型对不同时间模式有偏好，无单一模型能普遍出色，需利用其互补能力。

Method: 提出ZooCast，用One - Embedding - Fits - All范式构建统一表示空间，将现有模型组装成模型库动态选最优模型。

Result: ZooCast在GIFT - Eval零样本预测基准测试表现强，保持单一模型效率；在实际场景能无缝添加新模型提升精度且开销小。

Conclusion: ZooCast有效利用时间序列基础模型互补能力，实现高效准确的零样本预测。

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly
adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.

Motivation: 现有序列模型长程依赖能力缺乏理论研究，阻碍该方面系统改进。

Method: 用隐状态对过去输入的导数定义长程依赖，基于此对比SSM和transformer；提出新的SSM隐状态更新公式并证明其在标准高斯输入数据下的稳定性。

Result: SSM长程依赖随序列长度指数衰减，transformer注意力机制更灵活，理论上训练充分时建模长程依赖表现更好。

Conclusion: 结合注意力机制长程依赖的灵活性和SSM的计算效率，新的SSM隐状态更新公式具有稳定性。

Abstract: Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.

Result: 实验表明提出的方法在集中式和联邦学习设置中均优于现有分配策略，实现更好的隐私 - 效用权衡。

Conclusion: 框架为现有方法提供诊断见解，为设计深度模型中自适应有效噪声注入方案提供理论指导。

Abstract: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.

Abstract: Background: Heart failure (HF) research is constrained by limited access to
large, shareable datasets due to privacy regulations and institutional
barriers. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome
these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We
generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552
unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational
autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively
evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics,
survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results:
SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset,
exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying
histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices:
0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction
evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76).
Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks.
Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce
high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research
applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data
sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and
predictive modeling.

Motivation: 研究强化学习和监督微调在微调模型时对先验知识保留的差异。

Method: 对比RL和SFT在新任务上的表现，用KL散度衡量分布偏移，通过大语言模型和机器人基础模型实验验证，并提供理论依据。

Result: RL在保留先验知识和能力上显著优于SFT，且发现RL隐式倾向于KL最小解。

Conclusion: 提出‘RL's Razor’原则，即RL在解决新任务时倾向于与原模型KL距离最近的方法。

Abstract: Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new
task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We
find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift,
measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated
on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased
towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas
SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We
validate these findings through experiments with large language models and
robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why
on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle
$\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those
closest in KL to the original model.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种方法解决差分隐私中隐私保证和模型性能的权衡问题，实验表明该方法在计算成本和用户交互方面优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式多目标优化方法在差分隐私中效率低，未利用问题的独特结构。

Method: 理论推导权衡的形状以直接高效地建模帕累托前沿；用更具信息性的交互（展示假设的权衡曲线让用户选择）替代成对比较。

Result: 在六个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法以显著更低的计算成本和用户交互收敛到最优隐私 - 准确性权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在解决差分隐私的多目标优化问题上更高效。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.

Motivation: 现实决策问题可编码为不同抽象层次的CMAB，但缺乏利用各抽象层次信息和计算优势的通用方法。

Method: 提出AT - UCB算法，先利用因果抽象理论在易模拟的粗粒度CMAB实例中探索，再在目标CMAB的潜在最优动作集上使用传统UCB算法。

Result: 与经典UCB算法相比，AT - UCB显著降低累积遗憾，理论上给出累积遗憾新上界，实验上应用于不同分辨率和计算成本的流行病学模拟器。

Conclusion: AT - UCB算法能有效利用不同抽象层次CMAB实例的共享信息，具有优势。

Abstract: Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal
multi-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general
methodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each
abstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm
which efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances
defined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages
causal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and
coarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence
bound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the
CMAB of interest, leading to significant reductions in cumulative regret when
compared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB
theoretically, through a novel upper bound on the cumulative regret, and
empirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying
resolution and computational cost.

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Due to the threat of changing climate and extreme weather events, the
infrastructure of the United States Army installations is at risk. More than
ever, climate resilience measures are needed to protect facility assets that
support critical missions and help generate readiness. As most of the Army
installations within the continental United States rely on commercial energy
and water sources, resilience to the vulnerabilities within independent energy
resources (electricity grids, natural gas pipelines, etc) along with a baseline
understanding of energy usage within installations must be determined. This
paper will propose a data-driven behavioral model to determine behavior
profiles of energy usage on installations. These profiles will be used 1) to
create a baseline assessment of the impact of unexpected disruptions on energy
systems and 2) to benchmark future resiliency measures. In this methodology,
individual building behavior will be represented with models that can
accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data collected from energy
usage of non-residential buildings. Due to the nature of Army installation
energy usage data, similarly structured open access data will be used to
illustrate this methodology.

Motivation: 现实实验场景存在异方差随机不确定性且批量设置中可能相关，需更好的主动学习策略来处理模型与真实值的偏差。

Method: 利用偏差 - 方差权衡关系提出新主动学习策略，考虑有噪和无噪模型系统；通过新的协偏差 - 协方差关系以二次方式利用历史数据，采用特征分解策略进行批量处理。

Result: 基于协偏差 - 协方差关系的差分方法在批量设置中使用二次估计器时，表现优于BALD和Least Confidence等经典方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的主动学习策略和利用历史数据的方法有效，能在批量设置中取得更好效果。

Abstract: Real-world experimental scenarios are characterized by the presence of
heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, and this uncertainty can be correlated
in batched settings. The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the
expected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth
random variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared,
and an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose
novel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between
experimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise.
Finally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic
manner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which
naturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition
strategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance
relationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we
outperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.

TL;DR: 提出PagedEviction策略解决KV缓存内存瓶颈，在多模型测试中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存随序列长度增加成为内存瓶颈，需提高内存效率。

Method: 提出PagedEviction，采用针对分页内存布局的块级驱逐算法，与PagedAttention无缝集成。

Result: 在LongBench基准套件上对多个Llama模型评估，显示内存使用改善，长上下文任务精度高于基线。

Conclusion: PagedEviction策略能有效提高KV缓存内存效率，在长上下文任务中有更好表现。

Abstract: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model
(LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens,
enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length
increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address
this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache
pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or
evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient
block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method
integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications
to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models
on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with
better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

Motivation: 现有生成模型中迭代扩散模型计算成本高，少步替代方案质量有上限，问题源于训练目标局限。

Method: 引入精确的连续时间动态方程，定义任意有限时间间隔的状态转换，提出过渡模型（TiM）。

Result: TiM仅8.65亿参数，超越SD3.5（80亿参数）和FLUX.1（120亿参数），质量随步数增加单调提升，高分辨率下保真度出色。

Conclusion: TiM有效解决生成模型中生成步数与输出质量的冲突，具有良好的性能和扩展性。

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

TL;DR: 提出IPA框架改进LoRA，在语言和视觉基准测试中表现更好，用更少参数达相近性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的下投影随机初始化且与数据无关，丢弃有用信息，是性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出特征感知投影框架IPA，在线性情况下用近似主成分算法实例化，进行高效投影器预训练。

Result: 在语言和视觉基准测试中，IPA比LoRA和DoRA表现好，常识推理平均高1.5分，VTAB - 1k高2.3分，投影冻结时用约一半可训练参数达全LoRA性能。

Conclusion: IPA能有效改进LoRA，在性能和参数效率上有优势。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce
adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However,
LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding
potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection
changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the
adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We
propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves
information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA
with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient
projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and
vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on
average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on
VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable
parameters when the projection is frozen.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏因果意识，对异质性、混杂和观测约束建模不足，导致可解释性差，难以区分真实和虚假因果异质性。

Method: 提出HCL框架，引入编码结构异质性和混杂的等价表示，采用双向迭代策略交替优化因果聚类和结构学习，使用自监督正则化平衡跨簇通用性和特异性。

Conclusion: HCL框架有助于发现可解释的、机制层面的因果异质性。

Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in
domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal
awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and
observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty
distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose
an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering
with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers
latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type
observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels,
interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and
sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that
encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a
bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and
structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance
cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable
convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,
we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild
conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering
and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms
in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for
discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

Result: 在六个数学推理基准和两个分布外测试集上，HPT在不同规模和系列的模型上始终超越强基线模型。

Conclusion: 统一理论框架和HPT算法是有效的，能有效利用示范数据并进行稳定探索，不牺牲已学习的推理模式。

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESNs的动力学和设计常基于启发式而非第一性原理，需统一理论解释。

Method: 将ESNs明确重铸为SSMs，分析回声状态属性，开发两种映射，将教师强制视为状态估计并提出学习策略。

Result: 得出回声状态属性的可验证条件，实现频域表征，提出学习和超参数估计方法。

Conclusion: 该视角连接了储层计算与经典识别和现代核化SSMs，有助于理解和设计ESNs。

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient,
readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often
guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as
state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that
links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized
SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of
input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable
conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz
constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal
linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and
memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render
the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and
convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain
characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured
SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose
Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters
(leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace
procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.

Conclusion: 为现代表格方法益处提供基础理解，推动现有技术进步并指明未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in tabular deep learning have demonstrated exceptional
practical performance, yet the field often lacks a clear understanding of why
these techniques actually succeed. To address this gap, our paper highlights
the importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the
effectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that
the success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical
feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling
strategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing
high data uncertainty. By dissecting these mechanisms, we provide a unifying
understanding of the recent performance improvements. Furthermore, the insights
derived from this data-uncertainty perspective directly allowed us to develop
more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical outcome
of our analysis. Overall, our work paves the way to foundational understanding
of the benefits introduced by modern tabular methods that results in the
concrete advancements of existing techniques and outlines future research
directions for tabular DL.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于公理方法的模型是表示人类潜在决策过程的现实且可行的候选模型。

Abstract: Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with
the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal
values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and
practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then
used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in
such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of
human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify
information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned
from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and
can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other
decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic
approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise
comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive
processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work
characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class
of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across
alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed
rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information
ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent
underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in
a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass
the accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.

Conclusion: ChronoGraph为微服务系统相关研究提供了现实的基准。

Abstract: We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series
forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node
is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance
metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed
edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting
future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph
provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling
evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness
during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial
control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely
combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable
dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We
report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series
foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a
realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware
evaluation in microservice systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种结合滤波器剪枝与APoT量化的方法实现模型压缩，实验表明能有效压缩模型且精度损失小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN在资源受限设备部署有挑战，单独使用剪枝和量化技术有局限，结合二者可获更大压缩收益，但集成有难度。

Method: 提出两种集成相似性滤波器剪枝与APoT量化的方法，一是训练时同时进行剪枝和量化，二是先剪枝再对剪枝后模型量化。

Result: 实验结果表明提出的方法能有效压缩模型，且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: 提出的方法适合部署在计算资源有限的设备上。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved significant advances in a wide
range of applications. However, their deployment on resource-constrained
devices remains a challenge due to the large number of layers and parameters,
which result in considerable computational and memory demands. To address this
issue, pruning and quantization are two widely used compression techniques,
commonly applied individually in most studies to reduce model size and enhance
processing speed. Nevertheless, combining these two techniques can yield even
greater compression benefits. Effectively integrating pruning and quantization
to harness their complementary advantages poses a challenging task, primarily
due to their potential impact on model accuracy and the complexity of jointly
optimizing both processes. In this paper, we propose two approaches that
integrate similarity-based filter pruning with Adaptive Power-of-Two (APoT)
quantization to achieve higher compression efficiency while preserving model
accuracy. In the first approach, pruning and quantization are applied
simultaneously during training. In the second approach, pruning is performed
first to remove less important parameters, followed by quantization of the
pruned model using low-bit representations. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed approaches achieve effective model compression with minimal
accuracy degradation, making them well-suited for deployment on devices with
limited computational resources.

Result: 构建了一个动态、交互性强且用户友好的平台，能简化捐赠者注册、血液请求和沟通流程。

Conclusion: 该系统可减少紧急情况下的延迟和复杂性，提高血液及时可获取性和献血服务整体效率。

Abstract: Blood donation is a critical component of healthcare, yet locating suitable
donors in emergencies often presents significant challenges. This paper
presents the design and development of a Blood Donation Web Platform, a
web-based system that connects patients, donors, and administrators within a
centralized digital space. The platform allows interested donors to register
their personal information, including blood group, contact details, and
availability. Patients can search for donors based on blood group and location,
and the system provides a list of nearby donors who are ready to donate. The
platform design was guided by use case, database, class, and sequence diagrams
to ensure a well-structured and efficient system architecture. Modern web
technologies, including PHP (Laravel framework), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and
MySQL, supported by XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, were employed to implement a
dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform. By streamlining donor
refgistration, blood requests, and communication, the proposed system reduces
delays and complexities in emergencies, improving timely accessibility of blood
and enhancing overall efficiency in blood donation services.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏移动应用RE数据集在平台来源和相关RE活动方面的信息，需调查其现状。

Method: 按照Kitchenham等人的指南进行系统映射研究。

Result: 基于43篇论文，发现超90%的移动应用RE研究数据集来自谷歌应用商店和苹果应用商店，最常研究的RE活动是需求获取和需求分析。

Conclusion: 2012年以来移动应用RE研究使用数据集增多；过度使用特定应用商店数据集可能使RE知识有偏差；有尝试补充其他数据源；若要结果更具普遍性，需拓展替代数据源并进行多源互补实验，且应拓展其他RE活动的研究。

Abstract: [Background] Research on requirements engineering (RE) for mobile apps
employs datasets formed by app users, developers or vendors. However, little is
known about the sources of these datasets in terms of platforms and the RE
activities that were researched with the help of the respective datasets.
[Aims] The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-the-art of the
datasets of mobile apps used in existing RE research. [Method] We carried out a
systematic mapping study by following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al.
[Results] Based on 43 selected papers, we found that Google Play and Apple App
Store provide the datasets for more than 90% of published research in RE for
mobile apps. We also found that the most investigated RE activities - based on
datasets, are requirements elicitation and requirements analysis. [Conclusions]
Our most important conclusions are: (1) there is a growth in the use of
datasets for RE research of mobile apps since 2012, (2) the RE knowledge for
mobile apps might be skewed due to the overuse of Google Play and Apple App
Store, (3) there are attempts to supplement reviews of apps from repositories
with other data sources, (4) there is a need to expand the alternative sources
and experiments with complimentary use of multiple sources, if the community
wants more generalizable results. Plus, it is expected to expand the research
on other RE activities, beyond elicitation and analysis.

Motivation: 现代SoC设计中功能验证和调试是关键瓶颈，手动检测APB事务错误低效且易出错。

Method: 提出基于分层随机森林架构的自动错误诊断框架，采用多阶段错误诊断，用四个预训练二元分类器依次检测错误，优先处理高确定性地址相关故障。

Result: 实验整体准确率91.36%，地址错误精度和召回率近乎完美，数据错误表现稳健，团队在竞赛beta阶段获第一名。

Conclusion: 验证了分层机器学习作为电子设计自动化中硬件调试强大自动化工具的潜力。

Abstract: Functional verification and debugging are critical bottlenecks in modern
System-on-Chip (SoC) design, with manual detection of Advanced Peripheral Bus
(APB) transaction errors in large Value Change Dump (VCD) files being
inefficient and error-prone. Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this
study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical
Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four
pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access,
Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty
address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance
efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with
near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for
data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet
to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the
beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research
validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful
automated tool for hardware debugging in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).

Motivation: 以往难以自动追踪高级代码表示，研究旨在设计追踪解析树节点算法，并开展相关研究。

Method: 使用两种算法追踪解析树节点，构建不可解析代码状态的树表示，应用于公开学生按键数据并分析解析树。

Result: 发现新统计信息，如条件语句和循环内外代码删除率相似等。

Conclusion: 追踪解析树的能力为理解学生编程多方面情况打开了大门。

Abstract: Background and Context: Programming process data can be utilized to
understand the processes students use to write computer programming
assignments. Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in
various ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings,
character deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much
time students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our
inability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as
abstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states.
  Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first
algorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this
algorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual
tracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student
programming behavior that can now be done at scale.
  Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree
nodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code
states. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student
coursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse
trees.
  Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that
code is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops,
a third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with
which students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle.
  Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to
understanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of
structural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what
syntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and
attention shifting within the code.

Method: 提出SECO - TransDX概念模型，基于先前研究并通过与学术界和行业专家的德尔菲研究进行完善。

Conclusion: 为研究者开展未来研究和开发工具奠定基础，支持从业者设计可信、以开发者为中心的平台，提高透明度并促进长期参与。

Abstract: Software ecosystems (SECO) have become a dominant paradigm in the software
industry, enabling third-party developers to co-create value through
complementary components and services. While Developer Experience (DX) is
increasingly recognized as critical for sustainable SECO, transparency remains
an underexplored factor shaping how developers perceive and interact with
ecosystems. Existing studies acknowledge transparency as essential for trust,
fairness, and engagement, yet its relationship with DX has not been
systematically conceptualized. Hence, this work aims to advance the
understanding of transparency in SECO from a developer-centered perspective. To
this end, we propose SECO-TransDX (Transparency in Software Ecosystems from a
Developer Experience Perspective), a conceptual model that introduces the
notion of DX-driven transparency. The model identifies 63 interrelated
concepts, including conditioning factors, ecosystem procedures, artifacts, and
relational dynamics that influence how transparency is perceived and
constructed during developer interactions. SECO-TransDX was built upon prior
research and refined through a Delphi study with experts from academia and
industry. It offers a structured lens to examine how transparency mediates DX
across technical, social, and organizational layers. For researchers, it lays
the groundwork for future studies and tool development; for practitioners, it
supports the design of trustworthy, developer-centered platforms that improve
transparency and foster long-term engagement in SECO.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全从业者手动识别漏洞相关问题报告耗时，现有自动化方法缺乏富文本信息综合分析。

Method: VulRTex先利用大语言模型推理能力用历史问题报告准备漏洞推理数据库，再检索相关案例生成推理指导，引导大语言模型对目标问题报告富文本信息进行推理分析。

Result: 在973,572个问题报告上实验，VulRTex在数据集不平衡时识别漏洞报告和预测CWE - ID性能最佳，多项指标优于基线，时间成本低；应用于2024年GitHub问题报告识别出30个新兴漏洞，11个获CVE - ID。

Conclusion: VulRTex在识别漏洞相关问题报告上表现出色，具有实用性。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities exist in open-source software (OSS), and the
developers who discover these vulnerabilities may submit issue reports (IRs) to
describe their details. Security practitioners need to spend a lot of time
manually identifying vulnerability-related IRs from the community, and the time
gap may be exploited by attackers to harm the system. Previously, researchers
have proposed automatic approaches to facilitate identifying these
vulnerability-related IRs, but these works focus on textual descriptions but
lack the comprehensive analysis of IR's rich-text information. In this paper,
we propose VulRTex, a reasoning-guided approach to identify
vulnerability-related IRs with their rich-text information. In particular,
VulRTex first utilizes the reasoning ability of the Large Language Model (LLM)
to prepare the Vulnerability Reasoning Database with historical IRs. Then, it
retrieves the relevant cases from the prepared reasoning database to generate
reasoning guidance, which guides LLM to identify vulnerabilities by reasoning
analysis on target IRs' rich-text information. To evaluate the performance of
VulRTex, we conduct experiments on 973,572 IRs, and the results show that
VulRTex achieves the highest performance in identifying the
vulnerability-related IRs and predicting CWE-IDs when the dataset is
imbalanced, outperforming the best baseline with +11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, and
+10.5% Macro-F1, and 2x lower time cost than baseline reasoning approaches.
Furthermore, VulRTex has been applied to identify 30 emerging vulnerabilities
across 10 representative OSS projects in 2024's GitHub IRs, and 11 of them are
successfully assigned CVE-IDs, which illustrates VulRTex's practicality.

Abstract: Identifying which software versions are affected by a vulnerability is
critical for patching, risk mitigation.Despite a growing body of tools, their
real-world effectiveness remains unclear due to narrow evaluation scopes often
limited to early SZZ variants, outdated techniques, and small or
coarse-graineddatasets. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of vulnerability affected versions identification. We curate a
high quality benchmark of 1,128 real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities and
systematically evaluate 12 representative tools from both tracing and matching
paradigms across four dimensions: effectiveness at both vulnerability and
version levels, root causes of false positives and negatives, sensitivity to
patch characteristics, and ensemble potential. Our findings reveal fundamental
limitations: no tool exceeds 45.0% accuracy, with key challenges stemming from
heuristic dependence, limited semantic reasoning, and rigid matching logic.
Patch structures such as add-only and cross-file changes further hinder
performance. Although ensemble strategies can improve results by up to 10.1%,
overall accuracy remains below 60.0%, highlighting the need for fundamentally
new approaches. Moreover, our study offers actionable insights to guide tool
development, combination strategies, and future research in this critical area.
Finally, we release the replicated code and benchmark on our website to
encourage future contributions.outdated techniques, and small or coarse grained

TL;DR: 研究代码异味交互对模块间静态依赖分布的影响，发现代码异味对交互总体使依赖增加，建议开发者优先处理有交互的代码异味。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模块间依赖会使维护复杂且成本高，需了解导致依赖增加的情况，此前研究表明代码异味交互可能增加依赖，本研究旨在验证并探究其影响。

Method: 对116个开源Java系统进行依赖分析，比较代码异味间、代码异味与非代码异味间的交互。

Result: 代码异味对交互会使某些依赖增加、某些减少，但总体依赖增加，如Feature Envy方法与Data Classes间依赖中位数从1增至7。

Conclusion: 开发者应优先处理相互交互的代码异味，而非孤立的代码异味。

Abstract: The existence of dependencies between modules, such as classes, can mean that
changing a module triggers ripple effects that make maintenance complex and
costly, so the advice is to minimize dependencies between modules. It is
therefore important to understand the circumstances that can lead to increased
dependencies. Recent studies suggest that code smells, which are
characteristics of code that indicate potential design issues, may interact in
ways that increase dependencies between modules. In this study, we aim to
confirm previous observations and investigate whether and how the distribution
of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We
conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify the
interactions, comparing interactions among code smells and interactions between
code smells and non-code smells. Our results suggest that while interactions
between code smell pairs are associated with increases in certain dependencies
and decreases in others, overall, they are associated with an increase in total
dependencies. For example, the median number of dependencies between Feature
Envy methods and Data Classes is seven times as many as when the methods are
non-Feature Envy methods, increasing from 1 to 7. This implies that developers
should prioritize addressing code smells that interact with each other, rather
than code smells that exist only in isolation.

creating a critical security integration gap. This paper introduces and
formalizes the Auth Shim, a lightweight architectural pattern designed to solve
this problem. The Auth Shim is a minimal, external proxy service that acts as a
compatibility layer, translating requests from an enterprise Identity Provider
IdP into the native session management mechanism of a target application. A key
prerequisite for this pattern is that the target application must expose a
programmatic, secure administrative API. We present a case study of the
pattern's implementation at Adobe to integrate a popular OSS BI tool with Okta
SAML, which enabled automated Role-Based Access Control RBAC via IAM group
mapping and eliminated manual user provisioning. By defining its components,
interactions, and production deployment considerations, this paper provides a
reusable, secure, and cost-effective blueprint for integrating any standalone
OSS tool into an enterprise SSO ecosystem, thereby enabling organizations to
embrace open-source innovation without compromising on security governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码调试数据集主要评估函数级代码修复能力，忽视仓库级场景，且部分仓库级数据集存在任务、语言和错误类型多样性不足的问题。

Method: 引入RepoDebug多任务多语言仓库级代码调试数据集，对10个大语言模型进行评估实验。

Result: 在评估实验中，表现最佳的Claude 3.5 Sonnect模型在仓库级调试中仍不能有良好表现。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在仓库级代码调试方面仍存在不足，RepoDebug数据集有望推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant proficiency in code
debugging, especially in automatic program repair, which may substantially
reduce the time consumption of developers and enhance their efficiency.
Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the
development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on
assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the
more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an
incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging.
While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer
from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error
types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a
multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22
subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3
debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs,
where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well
in repository-level debugging.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Python包漏洞基准测试套件PyVul，评估现有检测工具并分析Python包漏洞分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python包漏洞受关注，当前漏洞检测工具有效性未充分研究，需填补相关空白。

Method: 引入包含1157个漏洞的PyVul，提供提交和函数级注释，采用LLM辅助数据清洗方法。

Result: 实现100%提交级和94%函数级标注准确率，分析显示Python包漏洞涉及多语言且类型多样，现有工具能力与实际需求有差距。

Conclusion: 凸显当前检测工具细粒度局限性，强调该领域未来改进的必要性。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, Python stands out for
its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Python packages, as units
of organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern,
highlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting
language, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or
interoperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to
Python packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools
remains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,
the first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.
PyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,
each linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection
techniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An
LLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,
achieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul
as the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further
carry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that
vulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and
exhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
multi-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to
vulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark
reveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools
and the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python
packages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs
observed in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of
current detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in
the field.

TL;DR: 提出FaaSGuard统一DevSecOps管道应对开源无服务器环境安全挑战，实证验证其效果好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无服务器计算虽有优势，但在开源平台存在独特安全挑战，现有方法缺乏集成全面安全策略。

Method: 提出FaaSGuard，在开发各阶段嵌入轻量级、故障关闭安全检查。

Result: 通过对20个真实无服务器函数的案例研究，FaaSGuard能有效检测和预防关键漏洞，精度95%，召回率91%，不显著干扰现有CI/CD实践。

Conclusion: FaaSGuard是应对开源无服务器环境安全挑战的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Serverless computing significantly alters software development by abstracting
infrastructure management and enabling rapid, modular, event-driven
deployments. Despite its benefits, the distinct characteristics of serverless
functions, such as ephemeral execution and fine-grained scalability, pose
unique security challenges, particularly in open-source platforms like
OpenFaaS. Existing approaches typically address isolated phases of the
DevSecOps lifecycle, lacking an integrated and comprehensive security strategy.
To bridge this gap, we propose FaaSGuard, a unified DevSecOps pipeline
explicitly designed for open-source serverless environments. FaaSGuard
systematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage
of the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and
monitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded
secrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through
a case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub
repositories. Results indicate that FaaSGuard effectively detects and prevents
critical vulnerabilities, demonstrating high precision (95%) and recall (91%)
without significant disruption to established CI/CD practices.

Result: 在基准系统上，算法样本质量与现有仅用能量的方法相当，且能量评估次数最多可减少三个数量级。

Conclusion: EWFM及相关算法能有效解决现有方法不足，高效从玻尔兹曼分布采样。

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized target distributions, e.g. Boltzmann distributions
$\mu_{\text{target}}(x) \propto \exp(-E(x)/T)$, is fundamental to many
scientific applications yet computationally challenging due to complex,
high-dimensional energy landscapes. Existing approaches applying modern
generative models to Boltzmann distributions either require large datasets of
samples drawn from the target distribution or, when using only energy
evaluations for training, cannot efficiently leverage the expressivity of
advanced architectures like continuous normalizing flows that have shown
promise for molecular sampling. To address these shortcomings, we introduce
Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM), a novel training objective enabling
continuous normalizing flows to model Boltzmann distributions using only energy
function evaluations. Our objective reformulates conditional flow matching via
importance sampling, allowing training with samples from arbitrary proposal
distributions. Based on this objective, we develop two algorithms: iterative
EWFM (iEWFM), which progressively refines proposals through iterative training,
and annealed EWFM (aEWFM), which additionally incorporates temperature
annealing for challenging energy landscapes. On benchmark systems, including
challenging 55-particle Lennard-Jones clusters, our algorithms demonstrate
sample quality competitive with state-of-the-art energy-only methods while
requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer energy evaluations.

Method: 提出四种方法，两种基于线性模型关联节点协变量与潜在变量，两种基于典型相关分析避免线性假设。

Result: 在低秩潜在空间模型下为四种方法提供理论保证，且计算成本低于先前方法。

Conclusion: 新方法在计算成本和建模假设方面有优势，通过模拟和真实数据验证了性能。

Abstract: In many application domains, networks are observed with node-level features.
In such settings, a common problem is to assess whether or not nodal covariates
are correlated with the network structure itself. Here, we present four novel
methods for addressing this problem. Two of these are based on a linear model
relating node-level covariates to latent node-level variables that drive
network structure. The other two are based on applying canonical correlation
analysis to the node features and network structure, avoiding the linear
modeling assumptions. We provide theoretical guarantees for all four methods
when the observed network is generated according to a low-rank latent space
model endowed with node-level covariates, which we allow to be
high-dimensional. Our methods are computationally cheaper and require fewer
modeling assumptions than previous approaches to network dependency testing. We
demonstrate and compare the performance of our novel methods on both simulated
and real-world data.

Conclusion: 所提出的结合压缩感知和扩散模型的方法能有效加速扩散模型推理。

Abstract: This paper develops dimension reduction techniques for accelerating diffusion
model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to
integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models: (i) compress the data into
a latent space, (ii) train a diffusion model in the latent space, and (iii)
apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent
space, facilitating the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under
suitable sparsity assumptions on data, the proposed algorithm is proved to
enjoy faster convergence by combining diffusion model inference with sparse
recovery. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal value for the latent space
dimension. We also conduct numerical experiments on a range of datasets,
including image data (handwritten digits, medical images, and climate data) and
financial time series for stress testing.

Abstract: We formulate the inverse problem in a Bayesian framework and aim to train a
generative model that allows us to simulate (i.e., sample from the likelihood)
and do inference (i.e., sample from the posterior). We review the use of
triangular normalizing flows for conditional sampling in this context and show
how to combine two such triangular maps (an upper and a lower one) in to one
invertible mapping that can be used for simulation and inference. We work out
several useful properties of this invertible generative model and propose a
possible training loss for training the map directly. We illustrate the
workings of this new approach to conditional generative modeling numerically on
a few stylized examples.

Result: 将每轮平均计算成本降至O(1)，并实现O(√T)的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 所提出的批量算法能有效降低随机匹配问题的计算成本，同时保证遗憾界。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel bandit framework for stochastic matching
based on the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) choice model. In our setting, $N$ agents
on one side are assigned to $K$ arms on the other side, where each arm
stochastically selects an agent from its assigned pool according to an unknown
preference and yields a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize
regret by maximizing the cumulative revenue from successful matches across all
agents. This task requires solving a combinatorial optimization problem based
on estimated preferences, which is NP-hard and leads a naive approach to incur
a computational cost of $O(K^N)$ per round. To address this challenge, we
propose batched algorithms that limit the frequency of matching updates,
thereby reducing the amortized computational cost (i.e., the average cost per
round) to $O(1)$ while still achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.

Motivation: 为并行时间（PinT）求解（常和偏）微分方程提供不确定性量化，弥补现有PinT方法概率对应物发展的关键空白。

Result: 在五个基准常微分方程系统上数值验证了算法的准确性和鲁棒性；在偏微分方程示例中，变体算法表现出更高性能。

Conclusion: 该工作弥补了现有PinT方法概率对应物发展的关键空白。

Abstract: We introduce Prob-GParareal, a probabilistic extension of the GParareal
algorithm designed to provide uncertainty quantification for the
Parallel-in-Time (PinT) solution of (ordinary and partial) differential
equations (ODEs, PDEs). The method employs Gaussian processes (GPs) to model
the Parareal correction function, as GParareal does, further enabling the
propagation of numerical uncertainty across time and yielding probabilistic
forecasts of system's evolution. Furthermore, Prob-GParareal accommodates
probabilistic initial conditions and maintains compatibility with classical
numerical solvers, ensuring its straightforward integration into existing
Parareal frameworks. Here, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the
computational complexity and derive error bounds of Prob-GParareal. Then, we
numerically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm
on five benchmark ODE systems, including chaotic, stiff, and bifurcation
problems. To showcase the flexibility and potential scalability of the proposed
algorithm, we also consider Prob-nnGParareal, a variant obtained by replacing
the GPs in Parareal with the nearest-neighbors GPs, illustrating its increased
performance on an additional PDE example. This work bridges a critical gap in
the development of probabilistic counterparts to established PinT methods.

Conclusion: 任务感知的判别和时间建模对增强双手解码有效。

Abstract: Decoding bimanual hand movements from intracortical recordings remains a
critical challenge for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), due to overlapping
neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions. We introduce BiND
(Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first
classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then
uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time
index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six
state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a
publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient.
BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69
($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model
(GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session
variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up
to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the
effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing
bimanual decoding.

Abstract: Finding the governing equations from data by sparse optimization has become a
popular approach to deterministic modeling of dynamical systems. Considering
the physical situations where the data can be imperfect due to disturbances and
measurement errors, we show that for many chaotic systems, widely used
sparse-optimization methods for discovering governing equations produce models
that depend sensitively on the measurement procedure, yet all such models
generate virtually identical chaotic attractors, leading to a striking
limitation that challenges the conventional notion of equation-based modeling
in complex dynamical systems. Calculating the Koopman spectra, we find that the
different sets of equations agree in their large eigenvalues and the
differences begin to appear when the eigenvalues are smaller than an
equation-dependent threshold. The results suggest that finding the governing
equations of the system and attempting to interpret them physically may lead to
misleading conclusions. It would be more useful to work directly with the
available data using, e.g., machine-learning methods.

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

TL;DR: 提出AR²框架增强大语言模型抽象能力，实验证明其可提升学生模型在编程任务上的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练大语言模型代码生成的方法多关注表面模式识别，忽略抽象能力的显式训练。

Method: 提出AR²框架，用教师模型转换内核问题描述，训练学生编码模型解决复杂叙述问题。

Result: AR²大幅提高学生模型在未见编程任务上的准确率。

Conclusion: 抽象能力是提升大语言模型泛化能力的关键技能。

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

Conclusion: 推理时构建知识图谱是一种有前途的方法，能以结构化、可解释和可扩展的方式提升大语言模型的事实性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Method: 在多语言图像专有数据集上对五个LVLMs和两个传统OCR系统进行大规模对比评估，涵盖多项指标，并进行边缘案例部署分析。

Result: Qwen精度最高，Sprinklr - Edge - OCR整体F1分数最佳，效率和成本表现好。

Conclusion: 即使在大语言模型时代，传统OCR系统因低计算需求、低延迟和高性价比，仍是边缘部署的最佳选择。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

Motivation: 大语言模型作为自动评估器存在自我偏好偏差，影响评估的公平性和可靠性，需要在不重新训练的情况下解决该问题。

Method: 引入区分合理与不合理自我偏好的数据集，用对比激活添加（CAA）和基于优化的方法构建引导向量。

Result: 引导向量可将不合理的自我偏好偏差降低达97%，大幅优于提示和直接偏好优化基线，但在合理自我偏好和无偏差一致性上不稳定。

Conclusion: 引导向量有潜力但也有局限性，需更稳健的干预措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

Method: 提出基于语义感知嵌入的评估指标SiLVERScore，在联合嵌入空间评估手语生成。

Result: 在PHOENIX - 14T和CSL - Daily数据集上，SiLVERScore能近乎完美区分正确和随机对（ROC AUC = 0.99，重叠率<7%），远超传统指标。

Conclusion: SiLVERScore指标具有语义和韵律变化鲁棒性，可用于手语生成评估，同时也探索了跨数据集的泛化挑战。

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

<details>

Motivation: 现有语义发散度量框架在主题识别上存在问题，优化的主题是基于空间接近性而非下游信息论分析。

Method: 基于确定性信息瓶颈（DIB）开发主题识别方法，用计算高效的上界替代难以处理的KL散度项，形成UDIB方法。

Result: UDIB可解释为熵正则化和强化版的K-means，生成的共享主题表示不仅空间连贯，还对提示 - 响应关系有最大信息性。

Conclusion: UDIB为SDM框架提供更好基础，是检测大语言模型幻觉更灵敏的新工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Method: 引入四指标套件，在150场交互式指称游戏的自我对战中评估三个专有大视觉语言模型，并与人类二人组对比。

Result: 三个模型在至少三个指标上与人类模式有差异，GPT4o - mini整体最接近人类；任务成功分数不代表成功接地，高图像 - 话语对齐不一定预示任务成功。

Conclusion: 提出的指标套件和研究结果为大视觉语言模型接地的未来研究提供了框架。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

Conclusion: 所提出的MTQA框架高效准确，代码已开源。

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

Conclusion: 研究推进了对RAG场景中灾难性遗忘的理解，提供适用于多种微调场景的实用方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 提出的SPFT - SQL方法在Text - to - SQL任务中有效，能提升模型生成正确SQL的能力。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 当前角色扮演对话代理（RPCA）研究存在忽视副语言特征和缺乏标准化评估基准的问题，本文引入VoxRole基准并构建资源对口语对话模型进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RPCA研究在副语言特征关注和评估基准方面存在局限，需要改进。

Method: 提出两阶段自动化流程构建VoxRole基准，先将电影音频与脚本对齐，再用大语言模型构建角色多维度档案。

Result: 利用VoxRole对当代口语对话模型进行多维度评估，揭示了它们在保持角色一致性方面的优缺点。

Conclusion: VoxRole基准能有效评估基于语音的RPCA，有助于了解模型在保持角色一致性上的表现。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Motivation: 大语言模型核查错误信息的有效性不确定，需系统评估其核查中文错误信息的能力和局限。

Method: 创建含约20k实例的精心标注数据集，开发分类法对模型生成的错误解释进行分类。

Result: 当前大语言模型即使增强推理和提示，生成准确核查结论仍有局限，事实编造是常见失败模式。

Conclusion: 大语言模型单独用于核查不可靠，但作为辅助工具可提升人类表现。

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

Motivation: 现有TKGQA方法处理复杂时间查询能力不足，推理能力有限且存在分解框架中的误差传播问题。

Method: 采用递归思维，将问题递归分解为子问题，自底向上利用大语言模型和TKG知识解决，并使用多路径答案聚合提高容错性，框架包含时间问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，“Multiple”和“Complex”类别Hits@1显著提升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RTQA框架能有效解决现有TKGQA方法的问题，具有良好性能。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在基于文本的情感分类上有进展，但诗歌尤其是韩国诗歌因比喻性语言和文化特异性未被充分探索。

Method: 构建包含7662个条目的多标签情感数据集，用有影响力的韩国诗人作品标注44种细粒度情感类别，对韩国语言模型进行微调。

Result: 微调后的模型显著优于先前模型，F1 - micro达到0.60，而基于通用语料库训练的模型为0.34。

Conclusion: 该研究将计算方法和文学分析相结合，通过保留韩国文学情感和文化细微差别的结构化数据，为诗歌情感的定量探索提供新可能。

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中语言具有可变性，而现有基准评估以固定格式进行，需评估模型对改写问题的鲁棒性及基准评估可靠性。

Method: 对六个常见基准中的所有问题进行系统改写，并测量34个不同规模和效果的最先进大语言模型在改写后的效果变化。

Result: 大语言模型排名在改写输入时相对稳定，但绝对效果分数显著下降。

Conclusion: 大语言模型难以应对语言可变性，质疑了基准评估的可靠性，强调需要能反映实际部署场景的鲁棒性感知基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Result: MAGneT在生成咨询会话的质量、多样性和治疗一致性上显著优于现有方法，微调开源模型表现更好。

Conclusion: MAGneT是生成合成心理咨询会话的有效方法，能提升咨询技能，公开代码和数据利于后续研究。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

Motivation: 现有ASR系统在处理特定领域命名实体尤其是同音词时存在问题，上下文ASR无法捕捉细粒度音素变化，且先前方法对实体处理存在不足。

Method: 提出Phoneme - Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation (PARCO)，集成音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤。

Result: PARCO在中文AISHELL - 1上CER为4.22%，在英文DATA2上WER为11.14%，在1000个干扰项情况下显著优于基线，在域外数据集THCHS - 30和LibriSpeech上也有稳健提升。

Conclusion: PARCO方法能有效解决现有ASR系统处理特定领域命名实体的问题，表现良好。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

Result: 评估发现所有模型都存在一致依赖过时知识的情况。

Conclusion: 为开发更及时可靠的医疗人工智能系统奠定基础，提出未来改进方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

Abstract: In the game-theoretic approach to controller synthesis, we model the
interaction between a system to be controlled and its environment as a game
between these entities, and we seek an appropriate (e.g., winning or optimal)
strategy for the system. This strategy then serves as a formal blueprint for a
real-world controller. A common belief is that simple (e.g., using limited
memory) strategies are better: corresponding controllers are easier to conceive
and understand, and cheaper to produce and maintain.
  This invited contribution focuses on the complexity of strategies in a
variety of synthesis contexts. We discuss recent results concerning memory and
randomness, and take a brief look at what lies beyond our traditional notions
of complexity for strategies.

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile money in Uganda has been a cornerstone of
financial inclusion, yet its security mechanisms remain a critical concern.
This study investigates a significant public response to perceived security
failures: the #StopAirtelThefty Twitter campaign of August 2025 Sparked by an
incident publicized by Dr. Jim Spire Ssentongo where a phone thief accessed a
victim's account, withdrew funds, and procured a loan, the campaign revealed
deep seated public anxiety over the safety of mobile money. This research
employs qualitative analysis to systematically examine the complaints raised
during this campaign, extracting key themes related to security vulnerabilities
and user dissatisfaction. By synthesizing these public sentiments, the paper
provides crucial insights into the specific security gaps experienced by users
and situates these findings within the larger framework of Uganda's mobile
money regulatory and operational environment. The study concludes with
implications for providers, policymakers, and the future of secure digital

Motivation: 研究人类与有基于种族偏好的模拟AI协作进行候选人评估时的决策情况，以及隐式关联测试（IAT）在人机协作中的作用。

Method: 开展简历筛选实验（N = 528），模拟AI偏见，在1526个场景中调查人们对不同种族候选人的偏好，用IAT测量无意识关联。

Result: 无AI或无偏见AI时人们平等选择候选人；与有偏好AI互动时，人们90%会偏好相同候选人；完成IAT可使选择非刻板印象候选人概率提高13%；即使认为AI建议质量低或不重要，决策仍可能受AI偏见影响。

Conclusion: 工作对AI - HITL场景的自主性、AI招聘系统设计评估及减轻协作决策偏见策略有启示，组织和监管政策应考虑决策复杂性。

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.

Motivation: 解决未知动力学的快速在线识别和控制这一核心挑战。

Method: 将回声状态网络（ESN）和模型预测路径积分（MPPI）控制相结合，提出RPPI框架，并进一步扩展到考虑不确定性的URPPI框架。

Result: 在控制Duffing振荡器和四水箱系统的实验中，URPPI相比传统基于二次规划的模型预测控制方法，控制成本最多降低60%。

Conclusion: URPPI能有效提升控制性能，降低控制成本。

Abstract: Neural networks capable of approximating complex nonlinearities have found
extensive application in data-driven control of nonlinear dynamical systems.
However, fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain
central challenges. This paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs) --
reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks -- and
model predictive path integral (MPPI) control -- sampling-based variants of
model predictive control -- to meet these challenges. The proposed reservoir
predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics
with ESN and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in parallelized MPPI
control computation without linearization approximations. The framework is
further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which leverages ESN
uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation: exploratory inputs
dominate during early learning, while exploitative inputs prevail as model
confidence grows. Experiments on controlling the Duffing oscillator and
four-tank systems demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing
control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based
model predictive control methods.

Motivation: 计算控制障碍函数（CBF）通常涉及复杂的鲁棒优化问题，难以处理，需要验证CBF是否满足鲁棒约束。

Method: 提出一种基于Lipschitz论证的方法进行验证，并形成样本高效的认证算法。

Result: 通过数值示例验证了所提出程序的效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的验证方法和认证算法有效且具有样本高效性。

Abstract: Control Invariant (CI) sets are instrumental in certifying the safety of
dynamical systems. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are effective tools to
compute such sets, since the zero sublevel sets of CBFs are CI sets. However,
computing CBFs generally involves addressing a complex robust optimization
problem, which can be intractable. Scenario-based methods have been proposed to
simplify this computation. Then, one needs to verify if the CBF actually
satisfies the robust constraints. We present an approach to perform this
verification that relies on Lipschitz arguments, and forms the basis of a
certification algorithm designed for sample efficiency. Through a numerical
example, we validated the efficiency of the proposed procedure.

extensive manual system identification or data-collection effort. However,
transformer-based foundation models in other domains have reduced data
requirements by leveraging pre-trained generalist models. Ultimately,
developing zero-shot foundation models of system dynamics could drastically
reduce manual deployment effort. While recent work shows that transformer-based
end-to-end approaches can achieve zero-shot performance on unseen systems, they
are limited to sensor models seen during training. We introduce the foundation
model unscented Kalman filter (FM-UKF), which combines a transformer-based
model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models via an UKF,
enabling generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new
sensor configurations. We evaluate FM-UKF on a new benchmark of container ship
models with complex dynamics, demonstrating a competitive accuracy, effort, and
robustness trade-off compared to classical methods with approximate system
knowledge and to an end-to-end approach. The benchmark and dataset are open
sourced to further support future research in zero-shot state estimation via
foundation models.

Result: 实现了基于强化学习控制器的离散选择与连续电池动力学相结合的混合系统。

Conclusion: 设计满足要求时，抽象方法能为电池闭环性能提供概率保证。

Abstract: Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are a ubiquitous element of
modern technology. In the last decades, the production and design of such
batteries and their adjacent embedded charging and safety protocols, denoted by
Battery Management Systems (BMS), has taken central stage. A fundamental
challenge to be addressed is the trade-off between the speed of charging and
the ageing behavior, resulting in the loss of capacity in the battery cell. We
rely on a high-fidelity physics-based battery model and propose an approach to
data-driven charging and safety protocol design. Following a
Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis scheme, we combine Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with recent developments in data-driven formal methods to obtain
a hybrid control strategy: RL is used to synthesise the individual controllers,
and a data-driven abstraction guides their partitioning into a switched
structure, depending on the initial output measurements of the battery. The
resulting discrete selection among RL-based controllers, coupled with the
continuous battery dynamics, realises a hybrid system. When a design meets the
desired criteria, the abstraction provides probabilistic guarantees on the
closed-loop performance of the cell.

Motivation: 为共享、有障碍工作空间中的同质线性多智能体系统，在无显式系统模型时提供运动规划方法。

Method: 各智能体通过求解凸半定规划从实验数据学习闭环行为，生成局部不变椭球和反馈增益；采样规划器构建路径点树，通过时空预留表协调智能体。

Result: 模拟结果表明该方法能在共享动力学和约束下，为多智能体合成同步、安全轨迹。

Conclusion: 所提框架生成的轨迹动态可行，且对环境约束和智能体间碰撞具有可证明的安全性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for
homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled
workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently
learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex
semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and
corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based
waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and
define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of
such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids
overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All
agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a
space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing
simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree
is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without
re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not
only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both
environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,
safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,
using only data and convex optimization tools.

TL;DR: 本文提出改进的国家层面综合评估模型FUND 3.9n，可估算国家社会碳成本（NSCC），结果显示NSCC对损害规格和偏好参数敏感，分部门模型对中低收入国家NSCC估值更高，为气候政策设计提供框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建能考虑各国经济结构、气候敏感性和人口暴露差异的模型，以估算国家社会碳成本，解决全球统一碳定价与国家差异化气候影响之间的差距。

Method: 提出FUND 3.9n模型，该模型将特定部门气候影响函数和参数不确定性分析纳入区域FUND 3.9框架，用于198个国家。

Result: NSCC和全球总和估计对损害规格和偏好参数高度敏感；分部门带不确定性的模型对中低收入国家NSCC估值更高。

Conclusion: 量化特定部门脆弱性和随机变异性对气候损害的放大作用及对NSCC分配公平性的影响，为气候政策设计提供理论和实证框架。

Abstract: This paper presents a refined country-level integrated assessment model, FUND
3.9n, that extends the regional FUND 3.9 framework by incorporating
sector-specific climate impact functions and parametric uncertainty analysis
for 198 individual countries. The model enables estimation of the national
social cost of carbon (NSCC), capturing heterogeneity across nations from
economic structure, climate sensitivity, and population exposure. Our results
demonstrate that both the NSCC and the global sum estimates are highly
sensitive to damage specifications and preference parameters, including the
pure rate of time preference and relative risk aversion. Compared to aggregated
single-sector approaches, the disaggregated model with uncertainty yields
higher values of the NSCC for low- and middle-income countries. The paper
contributes to the literature by quantifying how sector-specific
vulnerabilities and stochastic variability amplify climate damages and reshape
global equity in the distribution of the NSCC. The NSCCs derived from our model
offer policy-relevant metrics for adaptation planning, mitigation target
setting, and equitable burden-sharing in international climate negotiations.
This approach bridges the gap between globally harmonized carbon pricing and
nationally differentiated climate impacts, providing a theoretically grounded
and empirically rich framework for future climate policy design.

Motivation: 探究认证技术噪音在产品质量不可观测的双寡头市场中对卖家利润的影响。

Method: 理论分析噪音认证的两种相反效应，进行实验验证。

Result: 买家风险中性时，噪音认证使卖家利润降低；买家损失厌恶时，负面影响减轻甚至可增加利润，实验显示不准确认证更有利。

Conclusion: 在竞争激烈的环境中，不准确认证相对准确认证能提高卖家利润。

Abstract: This paper studies how noise in certification technology affects seller
profits in a duopoly with unobservable product quality. We identify two
opposing effects of noisy certification. First, it reduces the informativeness
of certification outcomes, homogenizing buyers' beliefs and limiting the scope
for vertical differentiation. Second, it introduces randomness into buyer
perceptions, endogenously generating differentiation between otherwise similar
products. When buyers are risk-neutral, the first effect dominates, reducing
seller profits. However, when buyers are loss averse, the negative impact of
reduced informativeness is mitigated, and noisy certification can increase
profits relative to accurate certification. Experimentally, treatments with
inaccurate certification are more profitable than those with accurate
certification, particularly in settings with intense competition.

Motivation: 旅游对地价的影响存在争议，需研究其关系。

Method: 采用中介分析和面板门槛回归，以年游客到达量代表旅游活动，分析2021 - 2024年日本1724个市町村数据。

Result: 地价大幅上涨集中在游客到达量前5.9%的‘明星’城市，多数市町村影响小或无影响，旅游对经济影响有明显非线性和空间异质性，旅游与地价增长的潜在机制复杂。

Conclusion: 需要制定促进包容性增长和旅游相关收益公平分配的政策。

Abstract: While tourism is widely regarded as a catalyst for economic and urban
transformation, its effects on land prices remain contested. This study
examines tourism and land prices using a panel of 1,724 Japanese municipalities
from 2021 to 2024, with annual tourist arrivals as a proxy for tourism
activity. Using mediation analysis and panel threshold regression, we show that
sizable land price increases are concentrated in a small group of "superstar"
cities, specifically those in the top 5.9 percent for tourist arrivals, while
most municipalities experience little or no effect. The results highlight
pronounced nonlinearities and spatial heterogeneity in tourism's economic
impact across Japan. The potential mechanisms linking tourism to land price
growth are mixed, with possible benefits for local residents as well as risks
of increased burdens. These findings underscore the need for policies that
promote inclusive growth and an equitable distribution of tourism-related
gains.

Result: 在基准任务和中高维更具挑战性的问题上，该方法表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的新SBI方法能在中高维参数空间更有效地探索复杂后验分布，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables Bayesian analysis when the
likelihood is intractable but model simulations are available. Recent advances
in statistics and machine learning, including Approximate Bayesian Computation
and deep generative models, have expanded the applicability of SBI, yet these
methods often face challenges in moderate to high-dimensional parameter spaces.
Motivated by the success of gradient-based Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian
sampling, we propose a novel SBI method that integrates score matching with
Langevin dynamics to explore complex posterior landscapes more efficiently in
such settings. Our approach introduces tailored score-matching procedures for
SBI, including a localization scheme that reduces simulation costs and an
architectural regularization that embeds the statistical structure of
log-likelihood scores to improve score-matching accuracy. We provide
theoretical analysis of the method and illustrate its practical benefits on
benchmark tasks and on more challenging problems in moderate to high
dimensions, where it performs favorably compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Imagine a world where clinical trials need far fewer patients to achieve the
same statistical power, thanks to the knowledge encoded in large language
models (LLMs). We present a novel framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling
of adverse events in multi-center clinical trials, leveraging LLM-informed
prior distributions. Unlike data augmentation approaches that generate
synthetic data points, our methodology directly obtains parametric priors from
the model. Our approach systematically elicits informative priors for
hyperparameters in hierarchical Bayesian models using a pre-trained LLM,
enabling the incorporation of external clinical expertise directly into
Bayesian safety modeling. Through comprehensive temperature sensitivity
analysis and rigorous cross-validation on real-world clinical trial data, we
demonstrate that LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance
compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches. This methodology paves the
way for more efficient and expert-informed clinical trial design, enabling
substantial reductions in the number of patients required to achieve robust
safety assessment and with the potential to transform drug safety monitoring
and regulatory decision making.

Conclusion: 文中未明确提及最终结论，但最后进行了相关讨论。

Abstract: Uplift models play a critical role in modern marketing applications to help
understand the incremental benefits of interventions and identify optimal
targeting strategies. A variety of techniques exist for building uplift models,
and it is essential to understand the model differences in the context of
intended applications. The uplift curve is a widely adopted tool for assessing
uplift model performance on the selection universe when observations are
available for the entire population. However, when it is uneconomical or
infeasible to select the entire population, it becomes difficult or even
impossible to estimate the uplift curve without appropriate sampling design. To
the best of our knowledge, no prior work has addressed uncertainty
quantification of uplift curve estimates, which is essential for model
comparisons. We propose a two-step sampling procedure and a resampling-based
approach to compare uplift models with uncertainty quantification, examine the
proposed method via simulations and real data applications, and conclude with a
discussion.

Conclusion: 该实现能显著提升Cosserat杆模拟性能，实现精确实时模拟。

Abstract: An elastic rod is a long and thin body able to sustain large global
deformations, even if local strains are small. The Cosserat rod is a non-linear
elastic rod with an oriented centreline, which enables modelling of bending,
stretching and twisting deformations. It can be used for physically-based
computer simulation of threads, wires, ropes, as well as flexible surgical
instruments such as catheters, guidewires or sutures. We present a
massively-parallel implementation of the original CoRdE model as well as our
inextensible variation. By superseding the CUDA Scalable Programming Model and
using inter-block synchronization, we managed to simulate multiple physics
time-steps per single kernel launch utilizing all the GPU's streaming
multiprocessors. Under some constraints, this results in nearly constant
computation time, regardless of the number of Cosserat elements simulated. When
executing 10 time-steps per single kernel launch, our implementation of the
original, extensible CoRdE was x40.0 faster. In a number of tests, the GPU
implementation of our inextensible CoRdE modification achieved an average
speed-up of x15.11 over the corresponding CPU version. Simulating a
catheter/guidewire pair (2x512 Cosserat elements) in a cardiovascular
application resulted in a 13.5 fold performance boost, enabling for accurate
real-time simulation at haptic interactive rates (0.5-1kHz).

Result: 方法能产生准确光照预测，有逼真高频细节，在定量和定性评估中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: LuxDiT方法在场景光照估计任务中有效且性能优越。

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: 尝试探索Perlin噪声分布，以前馈方式潜在地对现实世界异质散射进行建模。

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

Abstract: Context: Utilization of operating theaters is a major cost driver in
hospitals. Optimizing this variable through optimized surgery schedules may
significantly lower cost and simultaneously improve medical outcomes. Previous
studies proposed various complex models to predict the duration of procedures,
the key ingredient to optimal schedules. They did so perusing large amounts of
data.
  Goals: We aspire to create an effective and efficient model to predict
operation durations based on only a small amount of data. Ideally, our model is
also simpler in structure, and thus easier to use.
  Methods: We immerse ourselves in the application domain to leverage
practitioners expertise. This way, we make the best use of our limited supply
of clinical data, and may conduct our data analysis in a theory-guided way. We
do a combined factor analysis and develop regression models to predict the
duration of the perioperative process.
  Findings: We found simple methods of central tendency to perform on a par
with much more complex methods proposed in the literature. In fact, they
sometimes outperform them. We conclude that combining expert knowledge with
data analysis may improve both data quality and model performance, allowing for
more accurate forecasts.
  Conclusion: We yield better results than previous researchers by integrating
conventional data science methods with qualitative studies of clinical settings
and process structure. Thus, we are able to leverage even small datasets.

Abstract: Modern computing systems remain rife with software vulnerabilities. Engineers
apply many means to detect them, of which dynamic testing is one of the most
common and effective. However, most dynamic testing techniques follow a
top-down paradigm, and struggle to reach and exercise functions deep within the
call graph. While recent works have proposed Bottom-Up approaches to address
these limitations, they face challenges with false positives and generating
valid inputs that adhere to the context of the entire program.
  In this work, we introduce a new paradigm that we call Reactive Bottom-Up
Testing. Our insight is that function-level testing is necessary but not
sufficient for the validation of vulnerabilities in functions. What we need is
a systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also
validates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that
detected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a
three-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions
and generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and
extract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by
combining constraints to remove false positives. We implemented an automated
prototype, which we call Griller. We evaluated Griller in a controlled setting
using a benchmark of 48 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects,
where we successfully detected 28 known vulnerabilities. Additionally, we
evaluated Griller on several real-world applications such as Pacman, and it
discovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities. Our findings suggest that
Reactive Bottom-Up Testing can significantly enhance the detection of
vulnerabilities in complex systems, paving the way for more robust security
practices.

Conclusion: BIDO是一种有效的混合图像恶意软件检测器，能同时应对混淆和概念漂移问题。

Abstract: To identify malicious Android applications, various malware detection
techniques have been proposed. Among them, image-based approaches are
considered potential alternatives due to their efficiency and scalability.
Recent studies have reported that these approaches suffer significant
performance declines when confronted with obfuscation or concept drift.
However, existing solutions often treat these two challenges as different
problems, offering independent solutions. These techniques overlook the fact
that both challenges share a common statistical root, out-of-distribution, and
research from this perspective remains limited. In response, we propose BIDO, a
hybrid image-based malware detector designed to enhance robustness against both
obfuscation and concept drift simultaneously. Specifically, to improve the
discriminative power of image features, we introduce a local feature selection
module that identifies informative subregions within malware images. Second, to
enhance feature robustness, we model pairwise cross-modal dependencies in an
outer product space, enabling the extraction of stable co-occurrence patterns.
Third, to ensure feature compactness, we design a learnable metric that pulls
samples with identical labels closer while pushing apart those with different
labels, regardless of obfuscation or concept drift. Extensive experiments on
the real-world datasets demonstrate that BIDO significantly outperforms
existing baselines, achieving higher robustness against both concept drift and
obfuscation. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出NeuroBreak系统分析大语言模型越狱攻击及缓解漏洞，经评估验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越狱攻击技术不断发展，给大语言模型安全防御带来压力，且从内部分析安全弱点困难。

Method: 与三位AI安全专家合作设计系统需求，综合分析各种越狱攻击方法，结合逐层表征探测分析，从语义和功能角度分析关键神经元。

Result: 通过定量评估和案例研究验证了系统的有效性。

Conclusion: 为开发下一代应对越狱攻击的防御策略提供了机制性见解。

Abstract: In deployment and application, large language models (LLMs) typically undergo
safety alignment to prevent illegal and unethical outputs. However, the
continuous advancement of jailbreak attack techniques, designed to bypass
safety mechanisms with adversarial prompts, has placed increasing pressure on
the security defenses of LLMs. Strengthening resistance to jailbreak attacks
requires an in-depth understanding of the security mechanisms and
vulnerabilities of LLMs. However, the vast number of parameters and complex
structure of LLMs make analyzing security weaknesses from an internal
perspective a challenging task. This paper presents NeuroBreak, a top-down
jailbreak analysis system designed to analyze neuron-level safety mechanisms
and mitigate vulnerabilities. We carefully design system requirements through
collaboration with three experts in the field of AI security. The system
provides a comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods. By
incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a
novel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its
generation steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical
neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper
exploration of security mechanisms. We conduct quantitative evaluations and
case studies to verify the effectiveness of our system, offering mechanistic
insights for developing next-generation defense strategies against evolving
jailbreak attacks.

TL;DR: 提出LMAE4Eth多视图学习框架用于以太坊欺诈账户检测，结合交易语义、掩码图嵌入和专家知识，实验表明其性能优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有以太坊欺诈检测方法无法捕捉交易语义，难以学习有区分性的账户嵌入，自监督图学习方法在节点级任务表现不佳且有扩展性问题。

Method: 提出TxCLM将交易记录转换为语言表示，用对比学习和掩码交易模型学习账户表示；提出MAGAE通过重建节点特征进行账户检测；引入层邻居采样解决扩展性问题；用交叉注意力融合网络统一嵌入。

Result: 在三个数据集上与21种基线方法对比，在两个数据集上F1分数比最佳基线高10%以上。

Conclusion: LMAE4Eth框架在以太坊欺诈账户检测上表现良好，能有效解决现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods rely on context-independent,
numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account
transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction
records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings.
Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node
representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal
performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these
methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we
propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction
semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a
transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms
context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive
linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences
between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training
objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective,
learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked
account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning,
which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on
reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale
training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which
reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising
training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the
embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our
method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on
two of the datasets.

TL;DR: 文章提出KubeGuard框架，利用大语言模型分析K8s清单和运行日志，生成和优化配置以增强集群安全性，评估显示其实用性高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: K8s广泛应用带来安全挑战，现有解决方案多侧重检测，本文旨在解决过度宽松配置问题以降低风险。

Method: 设计KubeGuard框架，通过资源创建和资源优化两个任务，采用模块化提示链工作流，利用大语言模型分析清单和运行日志。

Result: KubeGuard能有效生成和优化K8s清单，评估指标显示其具有高精确率、召回率和F1分数。

Conclusion: KubeGuard可将运行时可观测性转化为可操作的最小权限配置指导，具有实用性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native
applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as
misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to
address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation,
and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions
focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or
anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime
log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly
permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments
through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It
leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs
reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.
This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for
new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.
KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,
developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our
evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s
manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both
proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores
affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime
observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.

Result: 得到适用于乘性和参数化噪声、无需双曲性的公式，提出前向扩散生成模型。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于构建前向扩散生成模型并应用于简单问题。

Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the linear response
(parameter-derivative of marginal or stationary distributions) of random
dynamical systems, and formally pass to the continuous-time limit. Our formula
works for multiplicative and parameterized noise over any period of time; it
does not require hyperbolicity. Then we derive a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm
for linear responses. With this, we propose a forward-only diffusion generative
model and test on simple problems.

Motivation: 探讨在两个贝叶斯智能体预测分布收敛但生成模型不同的情况下，一个智能体的隐变量能表示为另一个智能体隐变量函数的条件。

Method: 提出自然隐条件。

Result: 给出了保证隐变量可转换的简单条件（自然隐条件），并证明在无更多约束时，这是最通用的条件。

Conclusion: 定理对自然隐条件中的近似误差具有鲁棒性，有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Suppose two Bayesian agents each learn a generative model of the same
environment. We will assume the two have converged on the predictive
distribution, i.e. distribution over some observables in the environment, but
may have different generative models containing different latent variables.
Under what conditions can one agent guarantee that their latents are a function
of the other agents latents?
  We give simple conditions under which such translation is guaranteed to be
possible: the natural latent conditions. We also show that, absent further
constraints, these are the most general conditions under which translatability
is guaranteed. Crucially for practical application, our theorems are robust to
approximation error in the natural latent conditions.

Conclusion: MatterVial框架是高性能、透明工具，符合可解释AI原则，为材料发现提供方向。

Abstract: This study introduces MatterVial, an innovative hybrid framework for
feature-based machine learning in materials science. MatterVial expands the
feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of
pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based
(MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with
computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from
symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of
traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning
architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench
tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its
performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to,
state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for
multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate
models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into
explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances
materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that
aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted
and autonomous materials discovery.

Method: 引入新的过渡态概率表达式，进行数值测试，推导过渡速率表达式，将其与变分方法关联，并通过误差分解讨论数值问题。

Result: 新的过渡态概率和过渡速率估计对滞后时间选择的敏感性大大降低。

Conclusion: 新表达式在过渡态概率和过渡速率估计上表现更优，受滞后时间影响小。

Abstract: For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability
that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be
estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition
rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is
minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step,
resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an
alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag
time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and
resulting transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of
lag time. We derive an additional expression for the transition rate, relate
the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics
based on the mean-squared residual, and discuss further numerical
considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant public health and economic
challenge, increasing treatment costs and reducing antibiotic effectiveness.
This study employs machine learning to analyze genomic and epidemiological data
from the public databases for molecular typing and microbial genome diversity
(PubMLST), incorporating data from UK government-supported AMR surveillance by
the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland. We identify AMR patterns
in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates collected in the UK
from 2001 to 2017. The research integrates whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data,
epidemiological metadata, and economic projections to identify key resistance
determinants and forecast future resistance trends and healthcare costs. We
investigate gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone resistance and the tet(O) gene
for tetracycline resistance, training a Random Forest model validated with
bootstrap resampling (1,000 samples, 95% confidence intervals), achieving 74%
accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes. Time-series forecasting models (SARIMA,
SIR, and Prophet) predict a rise in campylobacteriosis cases, potentially
exceeding 130 cases per 100,000 people by 2050, with an economic burden
projected to surpass 1.9 billion GBP annually if left unchecked. An enhanced
Random Forest system, analyzing 6,683 isolates, refines predictions by
incorporating temporal patterns, uncertainty estimation, and resistance trend
modeling, indicating sustained high beta-lactam resistance, increasing
fluoroquinolone resistance, and fluctuating tetracycline resistance.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

Conclusion: 所提的SalientFusion方法有效，代码已开源。

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and

demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support

Result: 在LEVIRCD、WHUCD和SYSUCD上的大量实验表明，MMChange在多个指标上始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMChange方法对多模态遥感变化检测有效，代码开源。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

Result: SAC - MIL在CAMELYON - 16、TCGA - LUNG和TCGA - BRAC数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SAC - MIL是一种有效的WSI分类方法，且因MLP结构简单易部署。

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型处理复杂多元素提示和风格多样性有限的问题。

Method: 提出MEPG框架，包含PSA模块分解输入提示，MED模块通过动态专家路由实现跨区域生成，利用注意力门控机制选择专家模型，支持专家模型轻量级集成替换，有交互式界面。

Result: MEPG在图像质量和风格多样性上显著优于同骨干的基线模型。

Conclusion: MEPG框架有效提升了文本到图像扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Method: 提出集成通用YOLOv8模型和专用热模型的方法，用复杂边界框融合算法结合二者预测。

Result: 该方法mAP@.5达0.93，F1分数为0.90，优于单YOLOv8模型（mAP@.5为0.91）。

Conclusion: 结合多个YOLO架构和融合多光谱数据能提供更可靠解决方案，提升视觉和热缺陷检测效果。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

Motivation: 现有UCIR方法在处理跨域特征对齐时受困于领域差距，关键对象特征与特定领域风格纠缠。

Method: 利用文本到图像生成模型将对象特征从特定领域风格中解耦，渐进式对齐域内到跨域的相互邻居。

Result: DUDE在三个基准数据集的13个领域上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DUDE方法有效解决了UCIR中的领域差距问题，具有良好的应用前景，代码将发布。

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像标注工具需大量人工输入，对大数据集可扩展性有限，需新工具简化标注流程。

Method: 将先进基础模型集成到带过滤管道的界面，采用CLIP与预训练检测器、零样本模型结合，以低置信度阈值生成初始标注，还利用Segment Anything实现即时分割。

Result: 在COCO类测试中初始预测大多正确，支持多种交互工具让用户细化；支持多格式导出，缓存模型后可离线操作；经基准测试可减少高达90%人工。

Conclusion: VisioFirm通过AI辅助自动化有效减少人工标注工作量，保持高标注准确性，可在https://github.com/OschAI/VisioFirm获取。

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在GUI基础任务中，难以对合适图像区域进行有效推理，尤其是在高分辨率输入和复杂多元素视觉交互下。

Method: 提出LASER自进化框架，结合蒙特卡罗质量估计和基于IoU的区域质量评估，构建高质量偏好数据，引导模型关注关键区域并自适应分配推理步骤。

Result: 在ScreenSpot Pro和ScreenSpot - v2基准测试中取得持续性能提升，在ScreenSpot - Pro基准上微调GTA1 - 7B模型达到55.7分。

Conclusion: LASER框架有效，在7B规模模型中创造了新的SOTA。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集预测是图像到图像任务，图像编辑模型可能比文本到图像生成模型更适合微调，因此分析两者在密集几何估计的微调行为。

Method: 引入FE2E框架，将编辑模型原始流匹配损失重新表述为“一致速度”训练目标，用对数量化解决精度冲突，利用DiT全局注意力进行深度和法线联合估计。

Result: 在多数据集零样本单目深度和法线估计上性能提升显著，在ETH3D数据集上性能提升超35%，优于用100倍数据训练的DepthAnything系列。

Conclusion: 图像编辑模型具有固有结构先验，收敛更稳定、性能更高，FE2E框架有效提升密集几何预测性能。

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Method: 将长视频生成任务建模为自回归、逐段生成过程，通过前缀视频条件确保平滑，用360度锚定视频保证一致性。

Result: 生成了具有局部平滑和全局时间一致性的分钟级虚拟试穿视频。

Conclusion: VFR是长虚拟试穿视频生成领域的开创性工作。

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

Result: 广泛的定性和定量实验表明，该管道在多种场景下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的3D风格迁移管道有效，能实现更具结构化、视觉连贯和艺术感的风格化。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Conclusion: 强调累积行动一致性在重复社会困境中增强合作、制定稳健策略和提供低认知负担信息处理机制的关键作用。

Abstract: Using past behaviors to guide future actions is essential for fostering
cooperation in repeated social dilemmas. Traditional memory-based strategies
that focus on recent interactions have yielded valuable insights into the
evolution of cooperative behavior. However, as memory length increases, the
complexity of analysis grows exponentially, since these strategies need to map
every possible action sequence of a given length to subsequent responses. Due
to their inherent reliance on exhaustive mapping and a lack of explicit
information processing, it remains unclear how individuals can handle extensive
interaction histories to make decisions under cognitive constraints. To fill
this gap, we introduce coordinated reciprocity strategies ($CORE$), which
incrementally evaluate the entire game history by tallying instances of
consistent actions between individuals without storing round-to-round details.
Once this consistency index surpasses a threshold, $CORE$ prescribes
cooperation. Through equilibrium analysis, we derive an analytical condition
under which $CORE$ constitutes an equilibrium. Moreover, our numerical results
show that $CORE$ effectively promotes cooperation between variants of itself,
and it outperforms a range of existing strategies including memory-$1$,
memory-$2$, and those from a documented strategy library in evolutionary
dynamics. Our work thus underscores the pivotal role of cumulative action
consistency in enhancing cooperation, developing robust strategies, and
offering cognitively low-burden information processing mechanisms in repeated
social dilemmas.

Abstract: The study of exoplanetary atmospheres traditionally relies on forward models
to analytically compute the spectrum of an exoplanet by fine-tuning numerous
chemical and physical parameters. However, the high-dimensionality of parameter
space often results in a significant computational overhead. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach to atmospheric retrieval leveraging on quantum
extreme learning machines (QELMs). QELMs are quantum machine learning
techniques that employ quantum systems as a black box for processing input
data. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting exoplanetary
atmospheric features using QELMs, employing an intrinsically fault-tolerant
strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices, and we demonstrate such fault
tolerance with a direct implementation on IBM Fez. The QELM architecture we
present shows the potential of quantum computing in the analysis of
astrophysical datasets and may, in the near-term future, unlock new
computational tools to implement fast, efficient, and more accurate models in
the study of exoplanetary atmospheres.

Conclusion: 经验Kantorovich - Rubinstein距离具有近极小极大率最优性，方差增长接近二次时收敛速率变慢。

Abstract: We statistically analyze empirical plug-in estimators for unbalanced optimal
transport (UOT) formalisms, focusing on the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance,
between general intensity measures based on observations from spatio-temporal
point processes. Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly
time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$
over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish
sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic
dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition
of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal
dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes
slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial
covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes,
including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox
processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower
bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish
near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.

Abstract: Solo piano music, despite being a single-instrument medium, possesses
significant expressive capabilities, conveying rich semantic information across
genres, moods, and styles. However, current general-purpose music
representation models, predominantly trained on large-scale datasets, often
struggle to captures subtle semantic distinctions within homogeneous solo piano
music. Furthermore, existing piano-specific representation models are typically
unimodal, failing to capture the inherently multimodal nature of piano music,
expressed through audio, symbolic, and textual modalities. To address these
limitations, we propose PianoBind, a piano-specific multimodal joint embedding
model. We systematically investigate strategies for multi-source training and
modality utilization within a joint embedding framework optimized for capturing
fine-grained semantic distinctions in (1) small-scale and (2) homogeneous piano
datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that PianoBind learns multimodal
representations that effectively capture subtle nuances of piano music,
achieving superior text-to-music retrieval performance on in-domain and
out-of-domain piano datasets compared to general-purpose music joint embedding
models. Moreover, our design choices offer reusable insights for multimodal
representation learning with homogeneous datasets beyond piano music.

challenges. Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed,
their effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the
domain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human
speech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately
addressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges
with diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To
fill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale,
highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust
development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of
over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10
vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio
clips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive
experiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
trained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio
samples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice,
underscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods
trained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and
significantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error
rate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild
dataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.
AUDETER is available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解司法审议复杂性对评估司法系统效力和公平性至关重要，但实证研究受限，因此设计系统模拟印度司法审议过程。

Method: 构建包含法官、检察官、辩护律师和多个裁判官智能体的系统，集成基于特定领域知识库的RAG，裁判官智能体进行迭代审议。

Result: 设计出SAMVAD系统，给出系统架构、通信协议、RAG管道、模拟工作流程和评估计划。

Conclusion: 提供了可配置、可解释的多智能体平台，适用于印度法律背景下的司法模拟。

Abstract: Understanding the complexities of judicial deliberation is crucial for
assessing the efficacy and fairness of a justice system. However, empirical
studies of judicial panels are constrained by significant ethical and practical
barriers. This paper introduces SAMVAD, an innovative Multi-Agent System (MAS)
designed to simulate the deliberation process within the framework of the
Indian justice system.
  Our system comprises agents representing key judicial roles: a Judge, a
Prosecution Counsel, a Defense Counsel, and multiple Adjudicators (simulating a
judicial bench), all powered by large language models (LLMs). A primary
contribution of this work is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), grounded in a domain-specific knowledge base of landmark Indian legal
documents, including the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. This
RAG functionality enables the Judge and Counsel agents to generate legally
sound instructions and arguments, complete with source citations, thereby
enhancing both the fidelity and transparency of the simulation.
  The Adjudicator agents engage in iterative deliberation rounds, processing
case facts, legal instructions, and arguments to reach a consensus-based
verdict. We detail the system architecture, agent communication protocols, the
RAG pipeline, the simulation workflow, and a comprehensive evaluation plan
designed to assess performance, deliberation quality, and outcome consistency.
  This work provides a configurable and explainable MAS platform for exploring
legal reasoning and group decision-making dynamics in judicial simulations,
specifically tailored to the Indian legal context and augmented with verifiable
legal grounding via RAG.

Motivation: 减少对I/O、片外内存和主机控制的依赖，提升深度学习推理效率。

Method: 生成统一指令和数据流，利用可编程消息传递架构，采用如固定权重复用等技术。

Result: 应用于VGG - 19时利用率达88 - 92%，超97%消息内部生成，近89%时间用于片内传输，计算吞吐量超1TFLOP/s，流量减少可达100MB每层。

Conclusion: 基于流的计算有效，映射器能通过协调数据和指令流实现该执行方式。

Abstract: We introduce a mapping framework for deep learning inference that takes
advantage of predictable neural network behavior to plan both computation and
communication ahead of time. The framework generates a unified stream of
instructions and data, enabling the hardware to execute operations and route
information on its own, without frequent involvement from the host and with
minimal off-chip memory use. This naturally reduces reliance on I/O, off-chip
memory, and host control. By leveraging fine-grained message passing on a
programmable, message-based compute architecture, the framework keeps data
movement local and coordinates computation across the array using techniques
such as stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions.
Applied to VGG-19, the framework sustains high utilization (88 to 92 percent),
with over 97 percent of messages generated internally and nearly 89 percent of
time consumed on-chip transfers. Computation throughput scales beyond 1 TFLOP/s
on larger arrays, while traffic reductions from reuse and local aggregation
reach up to 100 MB per layer. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness
of streaming-based computation and show how our mapper enables this execution
style by tightly coordinating data and instruction flow across the hardware.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of computing an $\epsilon$-approximate
Nash Equilibrium of a zero-sum game in a payoff matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m
\times n}$ with $O(1)$-bounded entries given access to a matrix-vector product
oracle for $A$ and its transpose $A^\top$. We provide a deterministic algorithm
that solves the problem using $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-8/9})$-oracle queries,
where $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides factors polylogarithmic in $m$, $n$, and
$\epsilon^{-1}$. Our result improves upon the state-of-the-art query complexity
of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ established by [Nemirovski, 2004] and [Nesterov,
2005]. We obtain this result through a general framework that yields improved
deterministic query complexities for solving a broader class of minimax
optimization problems which includes computing a linear classifier (hard-margin
support vector machine) as well as linear regression.

Motivation: SVGD在实践中比基于分数估计的采样算法慢，为设计兼具SVGD优势的快速高效高维采样算法。

Method: 基于Nesterov方法在概率密度度量空间的加速梯度流引入ASVGD，推导基于动量的离散时间采样算法，加入Wasserstein度量正则化。

Result: 对于双线性核和高斯目标分布，得到最优参数为常数；数值示例显示ASVGD比SVGD和其他流行采样方法有效；在贝叶斯神经网络中，ASVGD在对数似然和总迭代次数上显著优于SVGD。

Conclusion: ASVGD是一种快速高效的高维采样算法，在多种场景下表现优于SVGD。

Abstract: Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a kernel-based and
non-parametric particle method for sampling from a target distribution, such as
in Bayesian inference and other machine learning tasks. Different from other
particle methods, SVGD does not require estimating the score, which is the
gradient of the log-density. However, in practice, SVGD can be slow compared to
score-estimation-based sampling algorithms. To design a fast and efficient
high-dimensional sampling algorithm with the advantages of SVGD, we introduce
accelerated SVGD (ASVGD), based on an accelerated gradient flow in a metric
space of probability densities following Nesterov's method. We then derive a
momentum-based discrete-time sampling algorithm, which evolves a set of
particles deterministically. To stabilize the particles' position update, we
also include a Wasserstein metric regularization. This paper extends the
conference version \cite{SL2025}. For the bilinear kernel and Gaussian target
distributions, we study the kernel parameter and damping parameters with an
optimal convergence rate of the proposed dynamics. This is achieved by
analyzing the linearized accelerated gradient flows at the equilibrium.
Interestingly, the optimal parameter is a constant, which does not depend on
the covariance of the target distribution. For the generalized kernel
functions, such as the Gaussian kernel, numerical examples with varied target
distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of ASVGD compared to SVGD and other
popular sampling methods. Furthermore, we show that in the setting of Bayesian
neural networks, ASVGD outperforms SVGD significantly in terms of
log-likelihood and total iteration times.

Abstract: The assignment problem, a cornerstone of operations research, seeks an
optimal one-to-one mapping between agents and tasks to minimize total cost.
This work traces its evolution from classical formulations and algorithms to
modern optimal transport (OT) theory, positioning the Quadratic Assignment
Problem (QAP) and related structural matching tasks within this framework. We
connect the linear assignment problem to Monge's transport problem,
Kantorovich's relaxation, and Wasserstein distances, then extend to cases where
source and target lie in different metric-measure spaces requiring
Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances. GW formulations, including the fused GW
variant that integrates structural and feature information, naturally address
QAP-like problems by optimizing alignment based on both intra-domain distances
and cross-domain attributes. Applications include graph matching, keypoint
correspondence, and feature-based assignments. We present exact solvers,
Genetic Algorithms (GA), and multiple GW variants, including a proposed
multi-initialization strategy (GW-MultiInit) that mitigates the risk of getting
stuck in local optima alongside entropic Sinkhorn-based approximations and
fused GW. Computational experiments on capacitated QAP instances show that
GW-MultiInit consistently achieves near-optimal solutions and scales
efficiently to large problems where exact methods become impractical, while
parameterized EGW and FGW variants provide flexible trade-offs between accuracy
and runtime. Our findings provide theoretical foundations, computational
insights, and practical guidelines for applying OT and GW methods to QAP and
other real-world matching problems, such as those in machine learning and
logistics.

Conclusion: 扩展了洗牌方法在变分不等式中的理论框架。

Abstract: Variational inequalities have gained significant attention in machine
learning and optimization research. While stochastic methods for solving these
problems typically assume independent data sampling, we investigate an
alternative approach -- the shuffling heuristic. This strategy involves
permuting the dataset before sequential processing, ensuring equal
consideration of all data points. Despite its practical utility, theoretical
guarantees for shuffling in variational inequalities remain unexplored. We
address this gap by providing the first theoretical convergence estimates for
shuffling methods in this context. Our analysis establishes rigorous bounds and
convergence rates, extending the theoretical framework for this important class
of algorithms. We validate our findings through extensive experiments on
diverse benchmark variational inequality problems, demonstrating faster
convergence of shuffling methods compared to independent sampling approaches.

Abstract: Global climate models parameterize a range of atmospheric-oceanic processes
like gravity waves, clouds, moist convection, and turbulence that cannot be
sufficiently resolved. These subgrid-scale closures for unresolved processes
are a leading source of model uncertainty. Here, we present a new approach to
developing machine learning parameterizations of small-scale climate processes
by fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model (FM). FMs are largely
unexplored in climate research. A pre-trained encoder-decoder from a 2.3
billion parameter FM (NASA and IBM Research's Prithvi WxC) -- which contains a
latent probabilistic representation of atmospheric evolution -- is fine-tuned
(or reused) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity
waves (GWs). The parameterization captures GW effects for a coarse-resolution
climate model by learning the fluxes from an atmospheric reanalysis with 10
times finer resolution. A comparison of monthly averages and instantaneous
evolution with a machine learning model baseline (an Attention U-Net) reveals
superior predictive performance of the FM parameterization throughout the
atmosphere, even in regions excluded from pre-training. This performance boost
is quantified using the Hellinger distance, which is 0.11 for the baseline and
0.06 for the fine-tuned model. Our findings emphasize the versatility and
reusability of FMs, which could be used to accomplish a range of atmosphere-
and climate-related applications, leading the way for the creation of
observations-driven and physically accurate parameterizations for more
earth-system processes.

Abstract: Neural networks have promise as surrogate partial differential equation (PDE)
solvers, but it remains a challenge to use these concepts to solve problems
with high accuracy and scalability. In this work, we show that neural network
surrogates can combine with iterative algorithms to accurately solve PDE
problems featuring different scales, resolutions, and boundary conditions. We
develop a subdomain neural operator model that supports arbitrary Robin-type
boundary condition inputs, and we show that it can be utilized as a flexible
preconditioner to iteratively solve subdomain problems with bounded accuracy.
We further show that our subdomain models can facilitate the construction of
global coarse spaces to enable accelerated, large scale PDE problem solving
based on iterative multilevel domain decomposition. With two-dimensional
Maxwell's equations as a model system, we train a single network to simulate
large scale problems with different sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and
dielectric media distribution. We further demonstrate the utility of our
platform in performing the accurate inverse design of multi-wavelength
nanophotonic devices. Our work presents a promising path to building accurate
and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for large practical problems.

Abstract: Cloud robotics has emerged as a promising technology for robotics
applications due to its advantages of offloading computationally intensive
tasks, facilitating data sharing, and enhancing robot coordination. However,
integrating cloud computing with robotics remains a complex challenge due to
network latency, security concerns, and the need for efficient resource
management. In this work, we present a scalable and intuitive framework for
testing cloud and edge robotic systems. The framework consists of two main
components enabled by containerized technology: (a) a containerized cloud
cluster and (b) the containerized robot simulation environment. The system
incorporates two endpoints of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnel, enabling
bidirectional communication between the cloud cluster container and the robot
simulation environment, while simulating realistic network conditions. To
achieve this, we consider the use case of cloud-assisted remote control for
aerial robots, while utilizing Linux-based traffic control to introduce
artificial delay and jitter, replicating variable network conditions
encountered in practical cloud-robot deployments.

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic
Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic
mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,
potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

Result: ARFM能自适应平衡RL优势保留和流损失梯度方差控制，微调过程更稳定高效。

Conclusion: ARFM具有出色的泛化性、鲁棒性、少样本学习和连续学习性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

Motivation: 最大化数据向真实机器人的可转移性，收集丰富感官数据用于机器人灵巧操作任务。

Method: 实现perioperation范式于DEXOP外骨骼，机械连接人类和机器人手指，提供反馈和镜像手部姿势。

Result: DEXOP能大规模收集高质量演示数据，基于其数据学习的策略提升了单位时间任务性能。

Conclusion: DEXOP是提升机器人灵巧性的有力工具。

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision
+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural
environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot
dexterity. Our project page is at https://dex-op.github.io.

TL;DR: 本文探讨增强滤波技术在神经视频压缩中的应用，提出自适应编码决策策略，实验表明相比现有神经视频编解码器比特率降低7.71%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究增强滤波技术在神经视频压缩中的应用，解决现有技术在自适应滤波应用上的挑战。

Method: 将增强滤波技术分为环内上下文滤波和环外重建增强，引入自适应编码决策策略动态确定滤波应用。

Result: 与现有神经视频编解码器相比，比特率降低7.71%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效，是基于条件的神经视频压缩中增强滤波的首次系统研究。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of enhancement filtering techniques in
neural video compression. Specifically, we categorize these techniques into
in-loop contextual filtering and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement based
on whether the enhanced representation affects the subsequent coding loop.
In-loop contextual filtering refines the temporal context by mitigating error
propagation during frame-by-frame encoding. However, its influence on both the
current and subsequent frames poses challenges in adaptively applying filtering
throughout the sequence. To address this, we introduce an adaptive coding
decision strategy that dynamically determines filtering application during
encoding. Additionally, out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement is employed to
refine the quality of reconstructed frames, providing a simple yet effective
improvement in coding efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the first systematic study of enhancement filtering in the context of
conditional-based neural video compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate a
7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs,
validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### [245] [EHVC: Efficient Hierarchical Reference and Quality Structure for Neural Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04118)
*Junqi Liao,Yaojun Wu,Chaoyi Lin,Zhipin Deng,Li Li,Dong Liu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出高效分层神经视频编解码器EHVC，有三项创新，性能超现有NVCs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频编解码器（NVCs）对参考结构设计关注不足，分层质量结构有优化空间。

Method: 提出EHVC，包含分层多参考方案、前瞻策略、带随机质量训练策略的逐层质量尺度。

Result: EHVC性能显著优于现有NVCs。

Conclusion: 所提EHVC有效解决NVCs存在的问题，提升了编码性能。

Abstract: Neural video codecs (NVCs), leveraging the power of end-to-end learning, have
demonstrated remarkable coding efficiency improvements over traditional video
codecs. Recent research has begun to pay attention to the quality structures in
NVCs, optimizing them by introducing explicit hierarchical designs. However,
less attention has been paid to the reference structure design, which
fundamentally should be aligned with the hierarchical quality structure. In
addition, there is still significant room for further optimization of the
hierarchical quality structure. To address these challenges in NVCs, we propose
EHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec featuring three key
innovations: (1) a hierarchical multi-reference scheme that draws on
traditional video codec design to align reference and quality structures,
thereby addressing the reference-quality mismatch; (2) a lookahead strategy to
utilize an encoder-side context from future frames to enhance the quality
structure; (3) a layer-wise quality scale with random quality training strategy
to stabilize quality structures during inference. With these improvements, EHVC
achieves significantly superior performance to the state-of-the-art NVCs. Code
will be released in: https://github.com/bytedance/NEVC.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文扩展‘引力井’模型，引入动态确认偏差变量，构建集成确认偏差的引力井模型，在Reddit社区验证可提升回声室检测效果，助力遏制错误信息传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有回声室模型常忽略个体确认偏差对错误信息传播的影响。

Method: 扩展‘引力井’模型，引入动态确认偏差变量，通过对比用户发帖历史和对不同观点帖子的回应计算该变量。

Result: 构建的集成确认偏差的引力井模型能更准确识别回声室，揭示信息健康的社区层面指标，在19个Reddit社区验证可提升检测效果。

Conclusion: 该模型为系统捕捉确认偏差在网络群体动态中的作用提供框架，有助于识别回声室，遏制错误信息传播。

Abstract: Social media echo chambers play a central role in the spread of
misinformation, yet existing models often overlook the influence of individual
confirmation bias. An existing model of echo chambers is the "gravity well"
model, which creates an analog between echo chambers and spatial gravity wells.
We extend this established model by introducing a dynamic confirmation bias
variable that adjusts the strength of pull based on a user's susceptibility to
belief-reinforcing content. This variable is calculated for each user through
comparisons between their posting history and their responses to posts of a
wide range of viewpoints.
  Incorporating this factor produces a confirmation-bias-integrated gravity
well model that more accurately identifies echo chambers and reveals
community-level markers of information health. We validated the approach on
nineteen Reddit communities, demonstrating improved detection of echo chambers.
  Our contribution is a framework for systematically capturing the role of
confirmation bias in online group dynamics, enabling more effective
identification of echo chambers. By flagging these high-risk environments, the
model supports efforts to curb the spread of misinformation at its most common
points of amplification.

Motivation: 眼动追踪在课堂教育技术中未充分利用，存在数据解读和可及性挑战，需探索其支持教学的方法。

Method: 通过涉及教师和学生的五项研究，遵循以用户为中心设计和数据讲故事原则进行迭代设计与评估。

Result: 熟悉的可视化、分层解释和叙事支架使凝视分析易接受且有教学价值，大语言模型驱动的对话代理可降低解读障碍。

Abstract: Eye-tracking offers rich insights into student cognition and engagement, but
remains underutilized in classroom-facing educational technology due to
challenges in data interpretation and accessibility. In this paper, we present
the iterative design and evaluation of a gaze-based learning analytics
dashboard for English Language Arts (ELA), developed through five studies
involving teachers and students. Guided by user-centered design and data
storytelling principles, we explored how gaze data can support reflection,
formative assessment, and instructional decision-making. Our findings
demonstrate that gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable
when supported by familiar visualizations, layered explanations, and narrative
scaffolds. We further show how a conversational agent, powered by a large
language model (LLM), can lower cognitive barriers to interpreting gaze data by
enabling natural language interactions with multimodal learning analytics. We
conclude with design implications for future EdTech systems that aim to
integrate novel data modalities in classroom contexts.

TL;DR: 本文提出用于检测XR系统中用户行为变化的原位测量方法，基于深度度量相似性学习的生物特征用户模型效果良好，相比现有方法有诸多优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测XR系统中用户因不同化身产生的行为变化，如普洛透斯效应或身体可供性相关的变化。

Method: 提出基于深度度量相似性学习的生物特征用户模型，与基于运动模式中心趋势的（非学习）运动分析和主观后暴露具身问卷两种方法对比评估。

Result: 主观评估证实身体图式感知操纵有效，非学习的客观分析显示不同条件下头部和手部运动有显著差异，相似性学习模型能成功识别行为变化。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外用户输入，运动分析可泛化和扩展，能进行个体层面分析，训练后可实时添加和评估用户。

Abstract: This paper introduces an unobtrusive in-situ measurement method to detect
user behavior changes during arbitrary exposures in XR systems. Here, such
behavior changes are typically associated with the Proteus effect or bodily
affordances elicited by different avatars that the users embody in XR. We
present a biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning, which
uses high-dimensional embeddings as reference vectors to identify behavior
changes of individual users. We evaluate our model against two alternative
approaches: a (non-learned) motion analysis based on central tendencies of
movement patterns and subjective post-exposure embodiment questionnaires
frequently used in various XR exposures. In a within-subject study,
participants performed a fruit collection task while embodying avatars of
different body heights (short, actual-height, and tall). Subjective assessments
confirmed the effective manipulation of perceived body schema, while the
(non-learned) objective analyses of head and hand movements revealed
significant differences across conditions. Our similarity learning model
trained on the motion data successfully identified the elicited behavior change
for various query and reference data pairings of the avatar conditions. The
approach has several advantages in comparison to existing methods: 1) In-situ
measurement without additional user input, 2) generalizable and scalable motion
analysis for various use cases, 3) user-specific analysis on the individual
level, and 4) with a trained model, users can be added and evaluated in real
time to study how avatar changes affect behavior.

TL;DR: 提出HumAIne - chatbot聊天机器人，用新用户画像框架个性化回复，实验显示个性化功能有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话式AI系统交互缺乏个性化和自适应对话管理，需改进。

Method: 预训练GPT生成的虚拟角色，在线强化学习代理结合隐式信号和显式反馈优化用户模型，动态调整对话策略。

Result: 在多对话领域对50个合成角色实验，启用个性化功能后用户满意度、个性化准确性和任务完成度提升，统计分析有显著差异。

Conclusion: AI驱动的用户画像有效，为未来实际验证奠定基础。

Abstract: Current conversational AI systems often provide generic, one-size-fits-all
interactions that overlook individual user characteristics and lack adaptive
dialogue management. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{HumAIne-chatbot}, an AI-driven conversational agent that personalizes
responses through a novel user profiling framework. The system is pre-trained
on a diverse set of GPT-generated virtual personas to establish a broad prior
over user types. During live interactions, an online reinforcement learning
agent refines per-user models by combining implicit signals (e.g. typing speed,
sentiment, engagement duration) with explicit feedback (e.g., likes and
dislikes). This profile dynamically informs the chatbot dialogue policy,
enabling real-time adaptation of both content and style. To evaluate the
system, we performed controlled experiments with 50 synthetic personas in
multiple conversation domains. The results showed consistent improvements in
user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement when
personalization features were enabled. Statistical analysis confirmed
significant differences between personalized and nonpersonalized conditions,
with large effect sizes across key metrics. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AI-driven user profiling and provide a strong foundation for
future real-world validation.
