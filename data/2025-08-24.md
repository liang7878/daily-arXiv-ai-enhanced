### [1] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出全谱神经符号推理架构，用图信号处理集成符号逻辑和神经推理，实验有改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型将谱图方法作为外围组件，需更好集成符号逻辑和神经推理的方法。

Method: 将整个推理流程在图谱域中构建，把逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，通过可学习谱滤波器处理，映射到符号谓词进行规则推理，给出完整数学框架。

Result: 在多个基准推理数据集上，相比现有神经符号模型，在逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率上有改进。

Conclusion: 图信号处理为鲁棒且可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础和高效计算基础。

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

### [2] [Goals and the Structure of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013)
*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一个认知主体目标导向状态表征的计算框架，描述性和规定性方面从主体 - 环境交互中共同出现，介绍目的状态构建并探讨其潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨世界模型中描述性和规定性方面是否可从主体目标中相互依存地共同出现，而非传统观点中的独立组件。

Method: 借鉴佛教认识论，引入目的状态构建，基于行为策略和理想经验特征间的统计差异解释目标导向学习。

Result: 提出新的计算框架和目的状态构建，有文献支持新视角。

Conclusion: 该视角有潜力为不同基质中有目的行为的行为、现象学和神经维度提供统一解释。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

### [3] [Collab-REC: An LLM-based Agentic Framework for Balancing Recommendations in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15030)
*Ashmi Banerjee,Fitri Nur Aisyah,Adithi Satish,Wolfgang Wörndl,Yashar Deldjoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Collab - REC多智能体框架以解决旅游推荐中的流行度偏差并提高多样性，实验证明其有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅游推荐中的流行度偏差问题，提高推荐的多样性，应对过度旅游现象并更好满足用户约束条件。

Method: 设计三个基于大语言模型的智能体从不同角度生成城市建议，由非大语言模型的协调器通过多轮协商合并和优化建议。

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，Collab - REC相比单智能体基线提高了推荐的多样性和整体相关性，挖掘出了常被忽视的小众旅游地。

Conclusion: 多利益相关方协作的上下文感知方法在大语言模型驱动的推荐系统中有应用前景。

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

### [4] [Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15047)
*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出利用大语言模型控制人群模拟中智能体运动的新方法，经实验验证能产生更真实的人群模拟效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于智能体的人群动画和模拟工作大多未考虑语言和对话等复杂社交与环境交互维度，导致智能体交互受限。

Method: 提出包含对话系统和语言驱动导航的新方法，通过查询以角色个性等为条件的大语言模型生成智能体间对话，并结合多种状态控制智能体导航和转向。

Result: 在两个复杂场景中验证方法，观察到智能体自动分组和取消分组，该方法可作为人群内信息传递机制。

Conclusion: 所提框架能产生更真实的人群模拟，自然涌现群体行为。

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [5] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型问答工具置信度校准，发现推理预算增加会损害校准，搜索增强生成表现更佳，信息获取或是关键瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型作为问答工具需进行可靠校准以避免过度自信，评估推理能力和预算对置信度评估准确性的影响。

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展至人类和行星健康领域进行系统评估。

Result: 近期推理大语言模型评估专家置信度准确率48.7%，增加推理预算损害校准；搜索增强生成准确率达89.3%。

Conclusion: 对于知识密集型任务的置信度校准，信息获取而非推理深度或推理预算可能是关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘（如卫星上）进行数据分析可实现新的地球科学测量和响应。

Method: 使用深度学习和光谱分析算法在CS - 6卫星上进行数据分析和推理。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: In partnership with Ubotica Technologies, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is
demonstrating state-of-the-art data analysis onboard CogniSAT-6/HAMMER (CS-6).
CS-6 is a satellite with a visible and near infrared range hyperspectral
instrument and neural network acceleration hardware. Performing data analysis
at the edge (e.g. onboard) can enable new Earth science measurements and
responses. We will demonstrate data analysis and inference onboard CS-6 for
numerous applications using deep learning and spectral analysis algorithms.

### [7] [S3LoRA: Safe Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning in Adaptation of Agent Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15068)
*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有参数高效微调技术适配大语言模型会有安全风险，且现有安全适配方法可用性受限。本文提出轻量级、无数据且与模型无关的S3LoRA框架，实验表明它能提升安全指标、保持或提升效用指标并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调技术适配大语言模型时会意外损害安全对齐，导致不安全或不稳定行为，且现有安全感知适配方法因常无法获取基础和指令调优模型检查点而可用性受限。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架，先引入MAS - SVD分析LoRA更新的结构属性并保留全局幅度信息，再设计SSI指标检测可能不安全的层，事后对这些层进行剪枝。

Result: 在代理规划和语言生成任务的大量实验和消融研究显示，S3LoRA能持续提升安全指标，保持或提升效用指标，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA是在现实世界资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于大语言模型的代理的实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

*Jennifer Leigh,Dimitrios Letsios,Alessandro Mella,Lucio Machetti,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将劳动力管理理解为工业应用中的抽象论证可应对变化并获解释，工具和解释比传统手动方案更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决劳动力管理中执行时的变化适应及为利益相关者提供解释的挑战。

Method: 将劳动力管理理解为工业应用中的抽象论证。

Result: 通过用户研究表明，工具和解释比传统手动解决方案能更快、更准确地解决问题。

Conclusion: 将劳动力管理理解为抽象论证可有效应对变化并提供忠实解释，且优于传统方案。

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

### [9] [Open-Universe Assistance Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15119)
*Rachel Ma,Jingyi Qu,Andreea Bobu,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Open - Universe Assistance Games框架和GOOD方法，在文本购物和模拟家庭机器人环境评估，表现优于无显式目标跟踪基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让具身AI智能体以可解释方式对未预定义的人类目标和偏好进行推理和行动。

Method: 引入OU - AGs框架，提出GOOD方法，利用LLM模拟不同意图用户，对候选目标进行概率推理。

Result: 在文本购物和AI2Thor模拟环境评估，经LLM和人类评估，GOOD方法优于无显式目标跟踪基线。

Conclusion: GOOD方法能在不依赖大型离线数据集的情况下实现丰富目标表示和不确定性估计，且表现良好。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前碎片化、封闭的出版生态难以适应大量AI生成的研究内容，传统期刊和预印本服务器存在缺陷，阻碍科研进展。

Method: 引入aiXiv平台，采用多智能体架构，提供API和MCP接口，实现人类和AI科学家的协作。

Result: 经过在aiXiv上的迭代修订和评审，显著提高了AI生成研究提案和论文的质量。

Conclusion: 本文为AI科学家构建了下一代开放获取生态系统，加速高质量AI生成研究内容的发表和传播。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

TL;DR: 本文介绍GUI - Owl基础GUI代理模型和Mobile - Agent - v3框架，前者在多GUI基准测试表现佳，后者进一步提升性能，二者均开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升开源端到端GUI代理模型在桌面和移动环境多方面任务的性能。

Method: 提出GUI - Owl模型，有大规模环境基础设施、多样基础代理能力、可扩展环境强化学习三项创新；在此基础上提出Mobile - Agent - v3框架。

Result: GUI - Owl - 7B在AndroidWorld和OSWorld有一定得分，Mobile - Agent - v3进一步提升得分，Trajectory - aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO)在OSWorld得分为34.9。

Conclusion: GUI - Owl和Mobile - Agent - v3达到开源GUI代理模型和框架的先进水平。

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are
open-sourced at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.

### [12] [PuzzleClone: An SMT-Powered Framework for Synthesizing Verifiable Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15180)
*Kai Xiong,Yanwei Huang,Rongjunchen Zhang,Kun Chen,Haipang Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍PuzzleClone框架用SMT合成可验证数据，构建超83K谜题基准，训练后模型在相关测试集和基准上表现提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成数据集可靠性、多样性和可扩展性有限，需高质量数学和逻辑数据集提升LLM推理能力。

Method: 引入PuzzleClone框架，包括将种子谜题编码为逻辑规范、随机化变量和约束生成变体、通过再现机制确保有效性。

Result: 构建超83K谜题基准，训练后PuzzleClone平均得分从14.4提升到56.2，7个逻辑和数学基准提升达12.5个百分点。

Conclusion: PuzzleClone框架能有效合成可验证数据，提升LLM在逻辑和数学推理上的性能。

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

*Wenjie Lin,Jin Wei-Kocsis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LLM4Sweat框架用于多汗症支持，经实验优于基线，为罕见病提供通用方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在罕见病应用受数据限制，尚无针对多汗症的定制模型，需填补此空白。

Method: 采用三阶段流程，包括数据增强（用前沿大模型生成合成案例创建数据集）、微调（在数据集上微调开源基础模型）、推理和专家评估（专家评估并迭代丰富数据集）。

Result: LLM4Sweat优于基线，是首个多汗症开源大语言模型框架。

Conclusion: LLM4Sweat为多汗症提供支持，其方法可推广到有类似数据和可信度挑战的其他罕见病。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在高约束条件下推理的可靠性缺乏足够研究，需评估其在资源受限调度问题上的表现。

Method: 提出R - ConstraintBench框架，在有向无环图中增加非冗余优先级约束，引入停机时间、时间窗口和析取约束，在数据中心迁移场景实例化基准并进行可行性和误差分析。

Result: 强模型在仅含优先级的有向无环图上表现接近上限，但当多种约束交互时可行性性能崩溃，在合成数据上的表现不能保证在实际场景的迁移。

Conclusion: 约束交互而非图深度是主要瓶颈，大语言模型泛化能力有限。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Motivation: 扩散模型在流程图所需的空间精度、对齐和符号结构方面表现不佳，需研究草图到图表的生成。

Method: 将视觉语言模型（VLM）与大语言模型（LLMs）结合，运行迭代循环，由Critic VLM提出编辑建议，多个候选LLMs合成SVG更新，Judge VLM选择最佳候选。

Result: 在10个来自已发表论文流程图的草图上，比GPT - 5和Gemini - 2.5 - Pro更忠实地重建布局和结构，准确组合图元且不插入多余文本。

Conclusion: 该方法优先考虑定性推理，能保留全局约束，支持人工修正，输出的SVG可扩展到演示工具，通过改进提示和特定任务工具可进一步优化。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The

Conclusion: 研究结果为城市规划者和政策制定者提供了基于证据的计算工具，有助于在快速城市化地区制定更有效的城市发展政策。

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

Motivation: 当前处理交互历史数据方法存储记忆内容质量差，影响召回和响应质量，需构建高质量长期记忆内容。

Method: 受认知心理学理论启发设计MMS，处理短期记忆成多个长期记忆片段，构建检索和上下文记忆单元，检索时匹配相关单元获取上下文以增强知识。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集实验对比证明方法有效，消融研究证实记忆单元合理性，分析显示其在记忆段数量和存储开销方面具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MMS能有效利用历史数据，有实际应用价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的智能体研究采用单粒度记忆机制，受收集经验质量限制，影响知识多样性和规划灵活性。

Method: 提出Coarse - to - Fine Grounded Memory框架，将环境信息转化为粗粒度焦点指导经验收集，再从经验中提取混合粒度提示；推理时检索相关经验和提示；面对环境异常时，将当前情况转化为细粒度关键信息进行自我问答反思和计划修正。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

Method: 引入SPW方案，为偏好标记轨迹中的每个转移从专家演示中搜索最相似的状态 - 动作对，根据相似度得分得出逐步重要性权重，用于指导标准偏好学习。

Result: SPW能实现从偏好和演示中进行有效的联合学习，在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上优于利用两种反馈类型的先前方法。

Conclusion: SPW方案有效统一专家演示和偏好两种反馈源，解决信用分配问题，提升离线强化学习效果。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型旅行规划系统与现实场景不匹配，存在用户需求获取、环境因素考虑和规划细节等问题。

Method: 构建RETAIL数据集，提出主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA。

Result: 现有最强模型通过率仅1.0%，TGMA通过率达2.72%。

Conclusion: TGMA为现实世界旅行规划提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Motivation: 现有自动化方法在跨临床任务泛化和开放式推理支持上存在不足。

Method: 用独立于导联的编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；在自回归ECG预测任务上预训练模型；进行ECG问答和诊断报告生成的指令调优。

Result: DiagECG在各任务表现出色，能泛化到分布外设置。

Conclusion: 整合符号ECG表示到LLMs用于医学推理有潜力，各组件有效。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT
and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training
workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating
and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the
overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

Result: 无明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 该框架可实现从0到深度推理的自适应推理，在部署时灵活调整思维链长度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能有效解决强化学习应用于安全关键系统时策略验证的问题。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

Motivation: HDM作为ACT - R声明性记忆系统的向量符号替代方案，有可扩展性等优势，希望现有ACT - R模型能使用HDM。

Method: 将HDM适配到Lisp ACT - R，开发向量版ACT - R函数，建立文本处理管道，创建基于向量表示的记忆块检索机制。

Result: 能保持HDM的向量符号优势，且使先前ACT - R模型只需少量修改就能使用该系统。

Conclusion: 后续将探索更好的向量时间上下文表示，开发基于实例学习理论的决策模型以进一步测试HDM模块。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

### [31] [Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652)
*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究仅通过分析策略分布提取与潜在价值函数一致的智能体行为见解，引入ICVs方法量化智能体影响，分析不同环境下智能体策略，识别有益团队成功的行为，增强了多智能体强化学习系统的可解释性。

Motivation: 可靠部署多智能体强化学习系统时，理解团队中个体智能体行为很关键，但缺乏价值反馈时难以推断智能体贡献。

Result: 分析了合作和竞争的多智能体强化学习环境，揭示智能体采用相似或不同策略的程度，识别出对团队成功有益的智能体行为。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为合作动态提供了新见解，增强了多智能体强化学习系统的可解释性。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

Motivation: 探究AI系统中数据从摄取到部署的生命周期产生的递归价值链对负责任AI现有框架的挑战，解决政策制定中对AI技术运作和经济逻辑动态理解缺失的问题。

Method: 引入概念工具构建AI管道，采用跨学科方法分析监管盲点，借鉴Simondonian技术哲学提出AI生命周期模型，引入‘futurity’概念。

Result: 凸显AI数据递归生成、非竞争性本质，指出权力不对称问题，特别是技术寡头集中价值和决策的现象。

Conclusion: 有效监管需解决基础设施和时间动态问题，提出生命周期审计、时间可追溯性等措施。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of
cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human
participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our
second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a
novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the
Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we

Motivation: 随着AI用户增多，需理解并减轻AI服务的环境影响，而此前缺乏生产环境下的相关研究。

Method: 提出并执行综合方法，对谷歌AI基础设施详细测量，考虑AI服务基础设施全栈。

Result: Gemini Apps文本提示能耗0.24Wh，远低于公开估计；一年间能耗降33倍、碳足迹降44倍；能耗低于看9秒电视，耗水量相当于5滴水。

Conclusion: 虽AI服务环境影响低，但仍需关注，全面测量环境指标对比较模型和提升效率至关重要。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

Motivation: 拟社会关系对人类福祉有不良影响，且防止其产生具有挑战性，需有效方法进行预防。

Method: 利用最先进语言模型构建简单响应评估框架实时评估对话中的拟社会线索，构建含30个对话的小合成数据集进行测试。

Result: 通过五阶段迭代评估，在宽容一致规则下成功识别所有拟社会对话且无假阳性，通常在前几次交流中就能检测到。

Conclusion: 评估代理可为预防拟社会关系提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

Motivation: 传统配置优化方法存在不足，如独立处理各维度、缺乏可解释性，自动化方法在动态适应性和语义推理方面有困难。

Method: 引入LGT框架，使用多智能体大语言模型，应用文本梯度，协调三个专门智能体形成反馈循环。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上全面评估，LGT比传统优化方法有显著改进，取得性能提升并保持高可解释性。

Conclusion: LGT框架在机器学习配置优化上有效，能提升性能且具备可解释性。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Result: 三阶段框架可分析伤口特征，基于图像为患者提供后续指导。

Conclusion: 所提方法为个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者预后奠定基础。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Motivation: 空间范围连接计算成本高、结果集大，需高效计算随机样本解决问题。

Method: 先设计两个使用现有随机抽样技术的基线算法，后提出新数据结构，可在预期时间 $	ilde{O}(n + m + t)$ 和空间 $O(n+m)$ 内处理问题。

Result: 使用四个真实空间数据集进行大量实验，算法在大多数测试中比基线算法快很多。

Conclusion: 提出的新算法在时间和空间上更高效，能有效解决高效计算随机样本的问题。

Abstract: Spatial range joins have many applications, including geographic information
systems, location-based social networking services, neuroscience, and
visualization. However, joins incur not only expensive computational costs but
also too large result sets. A practical and reasonable approach to alleviating
these issues is to return random samples of the join results. Although this is
promising and sufficient for many applications involving spatial range joins,
efficiently computing random samples is not trivial. This is because we must
obtain random join samples without running spatial range joins. We address this
challenging problem for the first time and aim at designing a time- and
space-efficient algorithm. First, we design two baseline algorithms that employ
existing techniques for random sampling and show that they are not efficient.
Then, we propose a new data structure that can deal with our problem in
$\tilde{O}(n + m + t)$ expected time and $O(n+m)$ space, where $n$ and $m$ are
the sizes of two point sets and $t$ is the required number of samples. We
conduct extensive experiments using four real spatial datasets, and the results
demonstrate that our algorithm is significantly faster than the baselines in
most tests.

Conclusion: CoreT算法在时态k - 核分析中有效且具备高可扩展性。

Abstract: Querying cohesive subgraphs in temporal graphs is essential for understanding
the dynamic structure of real-world networks, such as evolving communities in
social platforms, shifting hyperlink structures on the Web, and transient
communication patterns in call networks. Recently, research has focused on the
temporal $k$-core query, which aims to identify all $k$-cores across all
possible time sub-intervals within a given query interval. The state-of-the-art
algorithm OTCD mitigates redundant computations over overlapping sub-intervals
by exploiting inclusion relationships among $k$-cores in different time
intervals. Nevertheless, OTCD remains limited in scalability due to the
combinatorial growth in interval enumeration and repeated processing. In this
paper, we revisit the temporal $k$-core query problem and introduce a novel
algorithm CoreT, which dynamically records the earliest timestamp at which each
vertex or edge enters a $k$-core. This strategy enables substantial pruning of
redundant computations. As a result, CoreT requires only a single pass over the
query interval and achieves improved time complexity, which is linear in both
the number of temporal edges within the query interval and the duration of the
interval, making it highly scalable for long-term temporal analysis.
Experimental results on large real-world datasets show that CoreT achieves up
to four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the existing state-of-the-art
OTCD, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for temporal $k$-core
analysis.

Result: 在歧义查询数据集上，AmbiSQL歧义检测精度达87.2%，与文本转SQL系统集成时SQL精确匹配准确率提高50%。

Conclusion: AmbiSQL有显著性能提升和实际可用性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

Conclusion: 所提出的云边端协作查询处理方法能有效提升查询性能，实现资源合理调度。

Abstract: In cloud-edge-device (CED) collaborative query (CQ) processing, by leveraging
CED collaboration, the advantages of both cloud computing and edge resources
can be fully integrated. However, it is difficult to implement collaborative
operators that can flexibly switch between the cloud and the edge during query
execution. Thus, in this paper, we aim to improve the query performance when
the edge resources reach a bottleneck. To achieve seamless switching of query
execution between the cloud and edge, we propose a CQ processing method by
establishing a CED collaborative framework based on the collaborative scan
operator, so that query execution can be transferred to the cloud at any time
when the edge resources are saturated. Extensive experiments show that, under
sufficient network download bandwidth, the CED collaborative scan operator can
effectively alleviate the performance degradation of scan operators caused by
high I/O load and CPU wait time at the edge. It also achieves balanced resource
scheduling between the cloud and edge.

Motivation: 现有基于SSD的向量搜索系统存在数据布局不佳、未能有效利用内存空间和数据局部性差等问题，且未区分图索引结构和向量的访问频率。

Method: 设计Gorgeous系统，采用优先处理图结构的原则，设置内存缓存保存图节点邻接表，设计磁盘块格式存储向量和邻居邻接表。

Result: Gorgeous系统性能始终优于两个现有基于磁盘的向量搜索系统，平均查询吞吐量提升超60%，查询延迟降低超35%。

Conclusion: Gorgeous系统通过优先处理图结构的设计，有效提升了向量搜索性能。

Abstract: Similarity-based vector search underpins many important applications, but a
key challenge is processing massive vector datasets (e.g., in TBs). To reduce
costs, some systems utilize SSDs as the primary data storage. They employ a
proximity graph, which connects similar vectors to form a graph and is the
state-of-the-art index for vector search. However, these systems are hindered
by sub-optimal data layouts that fail to effectively utilize valuable memory
space to reduce disk access and suffer from poor locality for accessing
disk-resident data. Through extensive profiling and analysis, we found that the
structure of the proximity graph index is accessed more frequently than the
vectors themselves, yet existing systems do not distinguish between the two. To
address this problem, we design the Gorgeous system with the principle of
prioritizing graph structure over vectors. Specifically, Gorgeous features a
memory cache that keeps the adjacency lists of graph nodes to improve cache
hits and a disk block format that explicitly stores neighbors' adjacency lists
along with a vector to enhance data locality. Experimental results show that
Gorgeous consistently outperforms two state-of-the-art disk-based systems for
vector search, boosting average query throughput by over 60% and reducing query

TL;DR: 提出I/O高效缓存策略GoVector用于磁盘图索引，结合静态和动态缓存，重排磁盘节点，实验显示性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图基高维向量索引I/O成主导瓶颈，现有静态缓存策略在第二阶段失效。

Method: 提出GoVector，结合静态和动态缓存，重排磁盘节点以提升局部性和减少I/O开销。

Result: 在多公共数据集实验，90%召回率下，平均减少46% I/O操作，查询吞吐量提高1.73倍，查询延迟降低42%。

Conclusion: GoVector能显著提升磁盘图索引系统性能。

Abstract: Graph-based high-dimensional vector indices have become a mainstream solution
for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). However, their
substantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where
frequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the
dominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\% of query latency. Existing static
caching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by
preloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second
phase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high
recall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for
disk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores
entry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that
adaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search
phase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,
GoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the
same or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves
substantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations
by 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query
latency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.

Motivation: 现代分布式数据处理系统在平衡性能、代码可维护性和开发者生产力方面面临挑战，大协作环境中问题更严重。

Method: 提出新颖的声明式数据管道架构，引入模块化框架，结合逻辑计算单元Pipes，在Apache Spark中集成机器学习能力。

Result: 企业案例中开发效率提升50%，协作/故障排除时间从数周压缩至数天，性能在可扩展性上提升500倍、吞吐量提升10倍；学术实验中吞吐量至少快5.7倍，CPU利用率达99%。

Conclusion: 该架构能有效平衡系统性能和开发速度，为构建可扩展、可维护的数据处理系统提供见解。

Abstract: Modern distributed data processing systems face significant challenges in
balancing system performance with code maintainability and developer
productivity, particularly when integrating machine learning capabilities at
scale. In large collaborative environments, these challenges are amplified by
high communication overhead between teams and the complexity of coordinating
development across multiple groups. This paper presents a novel "Declarative
Data Pipeline" architecture that addresses these challenges while processing
billions of records with high accuracy and efficiency. Our architecture
introduces a modular framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning
capabilities within Apache Spark by combining logical computation units that we
refer as Pipes, departing from traditional microservice-based approaches. By
establishing clear component boundaries and standardized interfaces, we achieve
both modularity and system optimization without sacrificing maintainability.
The enterprise case study demonstrate substantial improvements in multiple
dimensions: development efficiency improved by 50%,
collaboration/troubleshooting efforts compressed from weeks to days,
performance improved by 500x in scalability and by 10x in throughput. The
academic experiment also proves at least 5.7x faster in throughput with 99% CPU
utilization than non-framework implementations. This paper details the
architectural decisions, implementation strategies, and performance
optimizations that enable these improvements, providing insights for building
scalable, maintainable data processing systems that effectively balance system
performance with development velocity.

TL;DR: 提出适用于3D计算连续体动态环境的无服务器工作流状态管理框架Databelt，实验表明可降低工作流执行时间、提高吞吐量和减少存储操作延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无服务器函数依赖远程存储服务管理状态会增加延迟和网络通信开销，在3D计算连续体动态环境中面临更多挑战。

Method: 引入SLO感知状态传播机制使函数状态在轨道上连续移动，主动将函数状态卸载到最合适节点；引入函数状态融合机制为共享同一无服务器运行时的函数抽象状态管理。

Result: 与基线相比，Databelt最多可减少66%的工作流执行时间，提高50%的吞吐量；函数状态融合最多可减少20%的存储操作延迟。

Conclusion: Databelt能确保在如3D计算连续体等高度动态网络环境中无服务器工作流的高效执行。

Abstract: Typically, serverless functions rely on remote storage services for managing
state, which can result in increased latency and network communication
overhead. In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute
Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent
changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of
ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,
leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this
paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless
workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.
Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the
function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads
function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,
the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing
state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,
Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state
management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions
are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing
redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow
efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow
execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the
baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion
reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage
requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of
serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D
Continuum.

Motivation: 现有工作表明解决舞蹈问题需对编排和初始配置有诸多限制，本文旨在探索放宽这些限制的方法。

Method: 考虑LUMI模型和顺序调度器，形式化定义通用舞蹈问题，利用顺序机器人实现分布式计数器机制的能力设计算法。

Result: 证明可放宽必要约束，可行编排长度受机器人可用颜色数的组合限制，给出解决通用舞蹈问题的算法，且算法能保证空间均匀性。

Conclusion: 在LUMI模型和顺序调度器下，能放宽舞蹈问题的现有约束并解决通用舞蹈问题，算法具有一定的实用性。

Abstract: The Dancing problem requires a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots to form
a sequence of patterns, aka perform a choreography. Existing work has proven
that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations
(e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries,
contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved
under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can
be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a
light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite
unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing
problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial
configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns,
only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including
multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length
of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the
number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the
Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential
robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid
movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed
choreography.

Abstract: Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational
demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to
model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision
LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute
optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and
(ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse
precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel
mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General
Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through
offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that
enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value
precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i)
hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive
head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level
parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading
pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures.
Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency
(30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in
mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks,
establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested
configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a
high-performance inference engine of the LMDeploy project, which is

Method: 采用拓扑证明，基于可剥载体映射序列确定协议复形演化，用Sperner引理证明k - set协议不可行，还使用新载体映射保持高连通性。

Result: 得到新的k - set协议下界，能用指数级更小的输入复形替代原输入伪球复形。

Conclusion: 新下界推广了已有结果，证明方法有效，可简化k - set协议分析。

Abstract: We develop a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous
message-passing systems connected by an arbitrary directed communication
network, where up to t processes may crash. Our result thus generalizes the
t/k+1 lower bound for complete networks in the t-resilient model by Chaudhuri,
Herlihy, Lynch, and Tuttle [JACM'00]. Moreover, it generalizes two lower bounds
for oblivious algorithms in synchronous systems connected by an arbitrary
undirected communication network known to the processes, namely, the domination
number-based lower bound by Castaneda, Fraigniaud, Paz, Rajsbaum, Roy, and
Travers [TCS'21] for failure-free processes, and the radius-based lower bound
in the t-resilient model by Fraigniaud, Nguyen, and Paz [STACS'24].
  Our topological proof non-trivially generalizes and extends the
connectivity-based approach for the complete network, as presented in the book
by Herlihy, Kozlov, and Rajsbaum (2013). It is based on a sequence of shellable
carrier maps that, starting from a shellable input complex, determine the
evolution of the protocol complex: During the first t/k rounds, carrier maps
that crash exactly k processes per round are used, ensuring high connectivity
of their images. A Sperner's lemma style argument is used to prove that k-set
agreement is still impossible by that round. From round t/k+1 up to our lower
bound, we employ a novel carrier map that maintains high connectivity. Our
proof also provides a strikingly simple lower bound for k-set agreement in
synchronous systems with an arbitrary communication network with initial
crashes. We express the resulting additional agreement overhead via an
appropriately defined radius of the communication graphs. Finally, we prove
that the usual input pseudosphere complex for k-set agreement can be replaced
by an exponentially smaller input complex based on Kuhn triangulations, which
we prove to be also shellable.

Result: 实验表明CausalMesh比现有方案有更低延迟和更高吞吐量。

Conclusion: CausalMesh是适用于计算迁移环境的有效缓存方法，性能表现良好。

Abstract: Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that
access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer
between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency.
However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be
scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause
non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to
causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate
from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the
first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write
operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers.
CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the
presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.
  We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our
experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher
throughput than existing proposals

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前有向q分析技术因缺乏高效算法，应用受限，现有方法复杂度高，而实际输出规模远小于最坏情况，因此需要开发高效输出敏感算法。

Method: 通过仔细研究各种有向q分析方法及其相互关系，反转计算顺序，并采用有针对性的预计算和缓存策略。

Result: 得到的有向q分析算法在温和假设下时间复杂度与输出大小呈线性关系，且被证明是时间最优的。

Conclusion: 所开发的算法解决了有向q分析缺乏高效算法的问题，能有效提升该技术的应用效率。

Abstract: Directed q-analysis is a recent extension of q-analysis, an established
method for extracting structure from networks, to directed graphs. Until
recently, a lack of efficient algorithms heavily restricted the application of
this technique: Previous approaches scale with the square of the input size,
which is also the maximal size of the output, rendering such approaches
worst-case optimal. In practice, output sizes of relevant networks are usually
far from the worst case, a fact that could be exploited by an (efficient)
output-sensitive algorithm. We develop such an algorithm and formally describe
it in detail. The key insight, obtained by carefully studying various
approaches to directed q-analysis and how they relate to each other, is that
inverting the order of computation leads to significant complexity gains.
Targeted precomputation and caching tactics further reduce the introduced
overhead, enough to achieve (under mild assumptions) a time complexity that is
linear in output size. The resulting algorithm for performing directed
q-analysis is shown to be time-optimal.

Conclusion: 提出新的公平概念“局部无嫉妒性”，并分析了其在特定条件下与帕累托效率匹配的关系。

Abstract: Two-sided matching, such as matching between students and schools, has been
applied to various aspects of real life and has been the subject of much
research, however, it has been plagued by the fact that efficiency and fairness
are incompatible. In particular, Pareto efficiency and justified-envy-freeness
are known to be incompatible even in the simplest one-to-one matching, i.e.,
the stable marriage problem. In previous research, the primary approach to
improving efficiency in matchings has been to tolerate students' envy, thereby
relaxing fairness constraints. In this study, we take a different approach to
relaxing fairness. Specifically, it focuses on addressing only the envy that
students may experience or prioritize more highly and seeks matchings without
such envy. More specifically, this study assumes that envy towards students who
are not acquaintances has less impact compared to envy towards students who are
acquaintances. Accordingly, we assume that the students know each other or not,
represented by an undirected graph, and define a local envy as a justified envy
toward an acquaintance or a neighbor in the graph. We then propose the property
that there is no local envy as a new relaxed concept of fairness, called local
envy-freeness. We analyze whether Pareto-efficient matching can be achieved
while maintaining local envy-freeness by meaningfully restricting the graph
structure and the school's preferences. To analyze in detail the fairness that
can achieve Pareto-efficient matching, we introduce a local version of the
relaxed fairness recently proposed by Cho et al. (AAMAS 2024), which
parameterizes the level of local envy-freeness by nonnegative integers. We then
clarify the level of local envy-freeness that can be achieved by
Pareto-efficient mechanisms for graphs that are ``close'' to trees and
single-peaked preferences on the graphs.

Abstract: A strategy profile in a multi-player game is a Nash equilibrium if no player
can unilaterally deviate to achieve a strictly better payoff. A profile is an
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium if no player can gain more than $\epsilon$ by
unilaterally deviating from their strategy. In this work, we use
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibria to approximate the computation of Nash equilibria.
Specifically, we focus on turn-based, multiplayer stochastic games played on
graphs, where players are restricted to stationary strategies -- strategies
that use randomness but not memory.
  The problem of deciding the constrained existence of stationary Nash
equilibria -- where each player's payoff must lie within a given interval -- is
known to be $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete in such a setting (Hansen and
S{\o}lvsten, 2020). We extend this line of work to stationary $\epsilon$-Nash
equilibria and present an algorithm that solves the following promise problem:
given a game with a Nash equilibrium satisfying the constraints, compute an
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium that $\epsilon$-satisfies those same constraints --
satisfies the constraints up to an $\epsilon$ additive error. Our algorithm
runs in FNP^NP time.
  To achieve this, we first show that if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists,
then one exists where the non-zero probabilities are at least an inverse of a
double-exponential in the input. We further prove that such a strategy can be
encoded using floating-point representations, as in the work of Frederiksen and
Miltersen (2013), which finally gives us our FNP^NP algorithm.
  We further show that the decision version of the promise problem is NP-hard.
Finally, we show a partial tightness result by proving a lower bound for such
techniques: if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists, then there must be one
that where the probabilities in the strategies are double-exponentially small.

Conclusion: 在不同估值数量的情况下，为不可分物品公平分配实现近似无嫉妒性提供了新的理论结果。

Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of a set of indivisible goods among
$n$ agents with $k$ distinct additive valuations, with the goal of achieving
approximate envy-freeness up to any good ($\alpha-\mathrm{EFX}$).
  It is known that EFX allocations exist for $n$ agents when there are at most
three distinct valuations due to HV et al. Furthermore, Amanatidis et al.
showed that a $\frac{2}{3}-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation is guaranteed to exist when
number of agents is at most seven. In this paper, we show that a
$\frac{2}{3}-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation exists for any number of agents when
there are at most four distinct valuations.
  Secondly, we consider a relaxation called $\mathrm{EFX}$ with charity, where
some goods remain unallocated such that no agent envies the set of unallocated
goods. Akrami et al. showed that for $n$ agents and any $\varepsilon \in
\left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right]$, there exists a $(1-\varepsilon)-\mathrm{EFX}$
allocation with at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((n/\varepsilon)^{\frac{1}{2}})$
goods to charity. In this paper, we show that a $(1-\varepsilon)-\mathrm{EFX}$
allocation with a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(k/\varepsilon)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ charity
exists for any number of agents when there are at most $k$ distinct valuations.

Result: 在CiteULike基准测试取得冷启动最优结果，在AnimeULike热启动中Recall@100表现优于WMF和DropoutNet。

Conclusion: DeepNaniNet能在数据稀疏、冷启动严重环境中提供高质量、隐私保护推荐，有效整合异构内容源。

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural
recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive
graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations,
and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"
user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen
users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted
Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x
and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet
delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold
start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous
QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This
research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing
with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable
performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model
can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady
performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in
recommendation systems.

Motivation: 现有生成式推荐系统在实践中表现不如ID模型，存在缺乏协同信号和编码器 - 解码器架构效率低的问题。

Result: 在标准顺序推荐基准测试中，缩小甚至消除了生成式和现代ID模型的性能差距。

Conclusion: 所提方法缩小了性能差距，同时保留了生成式范式的优势。

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖显式评分或全排序，存在评分无法反映真实偏好、获取全排序困难等问题。

Method: 提出基于广义效用的框架，采用基于效用的主动采样策略，基于概率Plackett - Luce框架构建偏好模型，通过矩阵分解和神经网络进行实验。

Result: 实验表明该框架更准确、数据效率更高、以用户为中心。

Conclusion: 该框架为个性化排序提供了更好的范式。

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

Result: MSPA在动态直播场景中显著提高了准确性、召回率和文本质量，优于基线。

Conclusion: MSPA能有效解决直播平台个性化推荐问题，提高推荐效果。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of live streaming platforms, personalized
recommendation systems have become pivotal in improving user experience and
driving platform revenue. The dynamic and multimodal nature of live streaming
content (e.g., visual, audio, textual data) requires joint modeling of user
behavior and multimodal features to capture evolving author characteristics.
However, traditional methods relying on single-modal features or treating
multimodal ones as supplementary struggle to align users' dynamic preferences
with authors' multimodal attributes, limiting accuracy and interpretability. To
address this, we propose MSPA (Multimodal Self-Corrective Preference
Alignment), a personalized author recommendation framework with two components:
(1) a Multimodal Preference Composer that uses MLLMs to generate structured
preference text and embeddings from users' tipping history; and (2) a
Self-Corrective Preference Alignment Recommender that aligns these preferences
with authors' multimodal features to improve accuracy and interpretability.
Extensive experiments and visualizations show that MSPA significantly improves
accuracy, recall, and text quality, outperforming baselines in dynamic live
streaming scenarios.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster
further research.

Conclusion: M-$LLM^3$REC框架有效解决了传统推荐系统在冷启动和稀疏数据场景下的问题，具有较好的应用价值。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and
platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting
decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering,
collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in
recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are
still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate
pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals,
or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user
motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language
models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions.
M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented
Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and
Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven
semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and
generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start
situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GA方法用于基于会话推荐存在两个挑战：简单应用GA会导致推荐性能下降；处理多个遗忘请求时未考虑样本顺序，导致推荐性能和遗忘效果不佳。

Method: CAU通过在遗忘样本上使用GA项处理遗忘任务，将整体优化任务构建为多目标优化问题并求解帕累托最优解；采用基于课程的顺序对遗忘样本进行处理，引入两个指标衡量遗忘难度，并提出两种采样策略选择样本。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Approximate unlearning for session-based recommendation refers to eliminating
the influence of specific training samples from the recommender without
retraining of (sub-)models. Gradient ascent (GA) is a representative method to
conduct approximate unlearning. However, there still exist dual challenges to
apply GA for session-based recommendation. On the one hand, naive applying of
GA could lead to degradation of recommendation performance. On the other hand,
existing studies fail to consider the ordering of unlearning samples when
simultaneously processing multiple unlearning requests, leading to sub-optimal
recommendation performance and unlearning effect. To address the above
challenges, we introduce CAU, a curriculum approximate unlearning framework
tailored to session-based recommendation. CAU handles the unlearning task with
a GA term on unlearning samples. Specifically, to address the first challenge,
CAU formulates the overall optimization task as a multi-objective optimization
problem, where the GA term for unlearning samples is combined with retaining
terms for preserving performance. The multi-objective optimization problem is
solved through seeking the Pareto-Optimal solution, which achieves effective
unlearning with trivial sacrifice on recommendation performance. To tackle the
second challenge, CAU adopts a curriculum-based sequence to conduct unlearning
on batches of unlearning samples. The key motivation is to perform unlearning
from easy samples to harder ones. To this end, CAU first introduces two metrics
to measure the unlearning difficulty, including gradient unlearning difficulty
and embedding unlearning difficulty. Then, two strategies, hard-sampling and
soft-sampling, are proposed to select unlearning samples according to
difficulty scores.

Motivation: 传统推荐系统用ItemIDs表征物品在处理大型动态语料和长尾数据时存在局限，现有语义ID方法面临平衡跨模态协同与特定性、弥合语义 - 行为差距的挑战。

Method: 提出Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ) 两阶段框架，先训练共享 - 特定分词器，利用多专家架构和正交正则化；再进行行为感知微调，通过多模态重建损失调整语义ID。

Result: 经大量离线实验和在线A/B测试，MMQ有效统一了多模态协同、特异性和行为适应。

Conclusion: MMQ为生成式检索和判别式排序任务提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

Conclusion: FSAP对神经检索系统构成现实且可扩展的威胁。

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上实验，MLLMRec平均比最佳基线提升38.53%。

Conclusion: MLLMRec达到了多模态推荐的最优性能。

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation typically combines the user behavioral data with
the modal features of items to reveal user's preference, presenting superior
performance compared to the conventional recommendations. However, existing
methods still suffer from two key problems: (1) the initialization methods of
user multimodal representations are either behavior-unperceived or
noise-contaminated, and (2) the KNN-based item-item graph contains noisy edges
with low similarities and lacks audience co-occurrence relationships. To
address such issues, we propose MLLMRec, a novel MLLM-driven multimodal
recommendation framework with two item-item graph refinement strategies. On the
one hand, the item images are first converted into high-quality semantic
descriptions using an MLLM, which are then fused with the textual metadata of
items. Then, we construct a behavioral description list for each user and feed
it into the MLLM to reason about the purified user preference containing
interaction motivations. On the other hand, we design the threshold-controlled
denoising and topology-aware enhancement strategies to refine the suboptimal
item-item graph, thereby enhancing the item representation learning. Extensive
experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that MLLMRec
achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 38.53%
over the best baselines.

Result: 在真实数据集实验和在线评估中表现出色。

Conclusion: REG4Rec模型有优秀性能和实际价值。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next action in large-scale
recommender systems. While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient
information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially
address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture
user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into
generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance.
However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic
representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning
pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these
issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that
constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a
self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations.
Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook
(MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby
constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance
the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement
stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a
Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions
tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA
introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During
inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed
to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of
erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy
for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online
evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial
practical value.

Conclusion: DiffuMIN在CTR预测中表现良好，能有效建模长期用户行为和探索用户兴趣空间。

Abstract: CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction, crucial for recommender systems and
online advertising, etc., has been confirmed to benefit from modeling long-term
user behaviors. Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of
noise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness.
Recent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models.
However, current two-stage models often filter out significant information,
resulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the
complete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and
generative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest
Network) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user
interest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest
extraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain
interest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between
interest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user
interests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and
interest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented
interest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with
the latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted
interest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the
generated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive
offline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial
dataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN.
Moreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B
testing. Our source code is available at

Abstract: CTR models play a vital role in improving user experience and boosting
business revenue in many online personalized services. However, current CTR
models generally encounter bottlenecks in performance improvement. Inspired by
the scaling law phenomenon of LLMs, we propose a new paradigm for improving CTR
predictions: first, constructing a CTR model with accuracy scalable to the
model grade and data size, and then distilling the knowledge implied in this
model into its lightweight model that can serve online users. To put it into
practice, we construct a CTR model named SUAN (Stacked Unified Attention
Network). In SUAN, we propose the UAB as a behavior sequence encoder. A single
UAB unifies the modeling of the sequential and non-sequential features and also
measures the importance of each user behavior feature from multiple
perspectives. Stacked UABs elevate the configuration to a high grade, paving
the way for performance improvement. In order to benefit from the high
performance of the high-grade SUAN and avoid the disadvantage of its long
inference time, we modify the SUAN with sparse self-attention and parallel
inference strategies to form LightSUAN, and then adopt online distillation to
train the low-grade LightSUAN, taking a high-grade SUAN as a teacher. The
distilled LightSUAN has superior performance but the same inference time as the
LightSUAN, making it well-suited for online deployment. Experimental results
show that SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning
three orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled
LightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher. More
importantly, the distilled LightSUAN has been integrated into an online
service, increasing the CTR by 2.81% and CPM by 1.69% while keeping the average
inference time acceptable. Our source code is available at

Conclusion: TrackRec框架能有效增强大语言模型在推荐系统中的推理和推荐能力。

Abstract: The extensive world knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recommendation
systems (RS). Specifically, The chain of thought (CoT) has been shown to
improve the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks for RS. However, due
to the fact that LLMs often suffer from hallucination issues, there is no
guarantee that their reasoning CoT is effective. A key challenge is to further
enhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs through effective CoT
reasonings. Therefore, we propose \textbf{TrackRec}, a framework designed to
enhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs for RS. TrackRec specifically focuses on
accurately inferring recommendation CoT \textbf{(RecCoT)} for user preference
using the knowledge from LLMs. This RecCoT can serve both as an explanation for
the LLM's completion of recommendation tasks and as auxiliary features to
assist recommendation models in accomplishing recommendation tasks. TrackRec
consists of a RecCoT generator $(G)$ and a RecCoT validator $(V)$. Furthermore,
we design alternating feedback learning mechanism that $G$ undergoes direct
preference optimization via feedback from $V$ to produce increasingly accurate
RecCoT aligned with $V$'s standards. Meanwhile, $V$ is fine-tuned using the
inference feedback from $G$ to enhance its validation capabilities in alignment
with recommendation tasks. Through iterative alternating feedback learning
between $G$ and $V$, TrackRec continuously improves the user preference
analysis capability of $G$ and the validation capacity of $V$. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it
surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, TrackRec has been deployed on a
lagre advertising platform with hundreds of millions of users, achieving
substantial gains.

TL;DR: 本文对整合反馈的先进检索和排序机制进行结构化概述，旨在弥合信息检索和自然语言处理视角，强调检索是端到端RAG系统的动态可学习组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数RAG管道将检索和推理视为孤立组件，静态设计限制了复杂任务的性能，需要引入结合反馈的自适应检索和排序方法。

Method: 对整合反馈的先进检索和排序机制进行结构化概述，根据反馈信号的来源和作用对其进行分类。

Result: 对相关机制进行了梳理和分类。

Conclusion: 可以弥合IR和NLP视角，突出检索在端到端RAG系统中的动态可学习性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

TL;DR: 本文首次评估主流多模态实体链接（MEL）模型在视觉对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，发现其普遍不足，提出LLM - RetLink模型提升抗干扰能力，在多数据集验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未系统探究视觉对抗攻击对MEL模型的影响，需评估模型鲁棒性并提升其抗干扰能力。

Method: 先全面评估主流MEL模型在不同对抗攻击场景下的鲁棒性，后提出LLM - RetLink模型，通过大视觉模型提取初始实体描述，再基于网络检索动态生成候选描述句。

Result: 当前MEL模型对视觉扰动普遍缺乏鲁棒性，输入的上下文语义信息可部分缓解影响；LLM - RetLink使MEL准确率提升0.4% - 35.7%，在对抗条件下优势明显。

Conclusion: 研究揭示MEL鲁棒性未被探索的方面，构建并发布首个MEL对抗样本数据集，为强化多模态系统在对抗环境中的弹性奠定基础。

Abstract: The explosive growth of multimodal data has driven the rapid development of
multimodal entity linking (MEL) models. However, existing studies have not
systematically investigated the impact of visual adversarial attacks on MEL
models. We conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of
mainstream MEL models under different adversarial attack scenarios, covering
two core tasks: Image-to-Text (I2T) and Image+Text-to-Text (IT2T). Experimental
results show that current MEL models generally lack sufficient robustness
against visual perturbations. Interestingly, contextual semantic information in
input can partially mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations. Based on
this insight, we propose an LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking
(LLM-RetLink), which significantly improves the model's anti-interference
ability through a two-stage process: first, extracting initial entity
descriptions using large vision models (LVMs), and then dynamically generating
candidate descriptive sentences via web-based retrieval. Experiments on five
datasets demonstrate that LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by
0.4%-35.7%, especially showing significant advantages under adversarial
conditions. This research highlights a previously unexplored facet of MEL
robustness, constructs and releases the first MEL adversarial example dataset,
and sets the stage for future work aimed at strengthening the resilience of
multimodal systems in adversarial environments.

Result: 在大规模电商平台进行的线上A/B测试显示有显著改进。

Conclusion: LongRetriever框架有效，已全量部署影响数十亿用户。

Abstract: Precisely modeling user ultra-long sequences is critical for industrial
recommender systems. Current approaches predominantly focus on leveraging
ultra-long sequences in the ranking stage, whereas research for the candidate
retrieval stage remains under-explored. This paper presents LongRetriever, a
practical framework for incorporating ultra-long sequences into the retrieval
stage of recommenders. Specifically, we propose in-context training and
multi-context retrieval, which enable candidate-specific interaction between
user sequence and candidate item, and ensure training-serving consistency under
the search-based paradigm. Extensive online A/B testing conducted on a
large-scale e-commerce platform demonstrates statistically significant
improvements, confirming the framework's effectiveness. Currently,
LongRetriever has been fully deployed in the platform, impacting billions of
users.

Motivation: 推荐系统存在强化现有偏差问题，本文旨在研究图书推荐中的主题偏差。

Method: 采用多阶段偏差评估框架，使用Book - Crossing数据集评估推荐中的主题偏差及其对不同用户群体的影响。

Result: 主题偏差源于内容失衡且被用户参与模式放大；小众和长尾兴趣用户获得的个性化推荐少，兴趣多样用户获得的推荐更一致。

Conclusion: 应谨慎设计推荐系统以适应更广泛的用户兴趣，为负责任AI做贡献，也为拓展主题偏差分析到其他领域奠定基础。

Abstract: Recommender systems help users discover new content, but can also reinforce
existing biases, leading to unfair exposure and reduced diversity. This paper
introduces and investigates thematic bias in book recommendations, defined as a
disproportionate favouring or neglect of certain book themes. We adopt a
multi-stage bias evaluation framework using the Book-Crossing dataset to
evaluate thematic bias in recommendations and its impact on different user
groups.
  Our findings show that thematic bias originates from content imbalances and
is amplified by user engagement patterns. By segmenting users based on their
thematic preferences, we find that users with niche and long-tail interests
receive less personalised recommendations, whereas users with diverse interests
receive more consistent recommendations. These findings suggest that
recommender systems should be carefully designed to accommodate a broader range
of user interests. By contributing to the broader goal of responsible AI, this
work also lays the groundwork for extending thematic bias analysis to other
domains.

Motivation: 自动驾驶汽车广泛应用需在常规和紧急操作中嵌入强大的道德推理。

Method: 提出分层安全强化学习框架，决策层用复合伦理风险成本训练智能体并采用动态优先经验回放机制，执行层用多项式路径规划及控制器生成轨迹。

Result: 在真实交通数据集上训练和验证，该方法在降低伦理风险和保持驾驶性能方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合形式控制理论和数据驱动学习可推动复杂人车混合交通环境下的道德自主。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因患者群体和临床环境差异大，单一模型无法适用于所有队列，需准确的肺癌风险预测方法。

Method: 代理先通过FAISS进行队列检索，识别相关患者群体，再用大语言模型根据检索队列和性能指标从八个模型中推荐最优算法。

Result: 构建了两阶段代理管道，实现动态、考虑队列的个性化风险预测。

Conclusion: 该代理支持灵活的模型选择，为现实世界肺癌筛查中的个性化风险评估提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test

Conclusion: 该框架具有强泛化和结构可扩展性，为帕金森病等慢性进展性疾病的智能建模提供可靠支持。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

Motivation: 现有NAS模型用于文本分类时无混合层次结构，搜索空间大且冗余，现有RL模型无法有效导航，扁平架构搜索的空间难遍历。

Method: 提出HHNAS - AM方法，引入架构模板组织搜索空间，基于领域特定线索设计搜索空间，采用基于Q - learning根据性能反馈动态调整的突变策略，模型为全概率模型。

Result: 在db_id预测任务多次实验中持续发现高性能架构，在Spider数据集上测试准确率比现有基线提高8%。

Conclusion: HHNAS - AM方法能有效探索搜索空间，可用于文本分类的神经架构搜索。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出Twin - Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin - Boot)方法，将不确定性估计融入优化过程，在DNN和高维逆问题中改善校准和泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准梯度下降方法没有置信度度量，在过参数化和低数据场景易过拟合；传统自举法应用于深度学习不实际。

Method: 提出Twin - Boot，并行训练两个相同模型，用周期性均值重置使轨迹在同一盆地，利用模型差异估计局部不确定性，自适应采样权重进行正则化。

Result: 在深度神经网络和复杂高维逆问题中，该方法改善校准和泛化，得到可解释的不确定性图。

Conclusion: Twin - Boot能有效将不确定性估计融入优化，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Method: 提出LPO框架，包括用绝对差损失替换对数 - 西格莫德函数进行梯度解耦、用偏移约束和正正则项提高稳定性、通过梯度分离实现可控拒绝抑制。

Result: LPO在通用文本、数学和文本转语音等多种任务上持续提升性能。

Conclusion: LPO是一种强大且可调节的偏好对齐范式。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

Conclusion: LFM4Ads框架在广告推荐中有效，能提升业务指标带来显著收入增长。

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Result: 系统在不同硬件平台和模型架构上显著优于现有工业方法，发现更优解，且复杂大模型分区过程全自动化。

Conclusion: 所提系统能有效解决现有自动分区器的问题，实现高效模型分区。

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

Result: 实现高保真重建，得到精细像素级不确定性图。

Conclusion: 该深度学习工作流可增强对流诊断、支持实时数据同化和改善长期气候再分析。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Abstract: Aura-CAPTCHA was developed as a multi-modal CAPTCHA system to address
vulnerabilities in traditional methods that are increasingly bypassed by AI
technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and adversarial image
processing. The design integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
generating dynamic image challenges, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive

correct images, while audio challenges combined randomized numbers and words
into a single task. RL adjusted difficulty based on incorrect attempts,
response time, and suspicious user behavior. Evaluations on real-world traffic

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经算子在理论和实践之间存在差距，通用逼近定理的最坏情况参数界限与实验证据相悖，本文旨在缩小这一差距。

Method: 使用有限维深度均衡层，针对可分希尔伯特空间上的凸优化问题族，研究生成均衡算子。

Result: 当输入损失位于合适的无限维紧集时，GEO 能以任意精度均匀逼近解，其秩、深度和宽度仅随逼近误差倒数对数增长。

Conclusion: 通过在非线性 PDEs、随机最优控制问题和有流动性约束的金融对冲问题三个应用上的验证，证明了理论结果和 GEOs 的可训练性。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Conclusion: 所提算法能在匹配先进优化器性能的同时，提升对步长超参数选择的稳定性。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Result: 进行了玩具规模原型测量，展示了实现可行性和定性扩展行为。

Conclusion: Hydra为模块化、输入自适应长上下文语言模型提供了路径，目标规模下的端任务增益验证待未来研究。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

Method: 引入SEAL，将输入图分解为化学相关片段，估计其对输出的因果影响，通过减少片段间消息传递实现片段贡献与模型预测的强对齐。

Conclusion: SEAL弥合了预测性能和可解释性的差距，为更透明、可操作的分子建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

Conclusion: 联邦学习在线性参数化非线性系统中有效，可提高收敛性能。

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

Method: 探索两种采样方法差异，提出结合经典和QA贡献的混合采样方法，还尝试用QA生成模式缓解灾难性遗忘。

Result: RBM训练无改进，两种采样方法差异在分布中低概率区域，对样本质量重要性低；首次证明QA生成模式可缓解灾难性遗忘，效率与经典方法相当。

Conclusion: 两种采样方法差异不足以改善RBM训练，嵌入困难可能使任务更复杂；QA在生成低概率分布样本方面有潜力，在缓解灾难性遗忘等机器学习应用中前景良好。

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

Conclusion: 为DNNs泛化提供深入见解，指明无监督学习动力学未来研究方向。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Conclusion: SAEs在降低多义性和概念控制方面有优势，但稀疏性设置需权衡，APP方法是一种有效的目标概念去除方法。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Result: 离线指标GAUC提升0.51%，在线实验ROI增加2.6%。

Conclusion: MAL框架优于单归因学习基线，能更好地捕捉用户转化模式，适用于工业部署。

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Conclusion: CETs存在易被绕过和副作用等问题，开源资源助力未来鲁棒概念擦除工作。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

Conclusion: 通用强化学习（URL）将强化学习核心的求不动点问题推广到异步并行分布式确定最终余代数。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Conclusion: 讨论了DPML可重复性的独特挑战及应对方法，得出获取科学有效和可靠结果的见解与最佳实践。

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

TL;DR: 本文提出SafeLLM防御框架，通过三阶段流程从大语言模型中消除有害知识，实验表明其能降低越狱攻击成功率，且性能表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越狱攻击对大语言模型安全构成严重威胁，需有效防御方法。

Method: 提出SafeLLM框架，采用三阶段流程：动态不安全输出检测、标记级有害内容追踪、约束优化，识别并中和负责有害生成路径的FFN子结构。

Result: 在多个越狱基准测试中，SafeLLM大幅降低攻击成功率，保持高性能，相比标准防御方法有更强安全保障、更精确控制有害行为和更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 知识消除是实现大语言模型可扩展和有效安全的有前景方向。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

Result: FairPrep可实现高效实验，自动报告公平性和效用指标。

Conclusion: FairPrep填补公平性基准测试空白，为数据级公平研究提供实用基础。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Result: 所提出的频率自适应TNN算法显著提高了TNN解决复杂多尺度问题的能力。

Conclusion: 频率自适应TNN算法有效且鲁棒，能解决TNN在高维多尺度问题中的不足。

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Result: 在五个不同睡眠分期数据集上评估，与现有方法对比达SOTA，进行消融分析并解释差异注意力权重。

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

Conclusion: 所提出的基于局部最优保证的框架能更具可扩展性地合成机器学习模型解释。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think

reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full

Method: 在多关系链接预测中结合基于transformer的嵌入来检验CSG指标，还引入并测试一组结构和语义的知识图谱复杂度指标。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测场景不稳定且缺乏泛化预测能力，需要更稳定、可解释和任务对齐的数据集复杂度指标。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Conclusion: 部分逻辑在解决未知类相关挑战方面有效。

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Conclusion: 通过算法集体行动框架，用户端可在不改变企业训练过程情况下增强模型公平性。

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

Motivation: 现有动态图级嵌入方法存在结构访问偏差和突变演化盲目性问题，需改进。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，EvoFormer在图相似性排名、时间异常检测和时间分割任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EvoFormer能有效纠正结构和时间偏差。

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Conclusion: 提供了CITE数据集、标准化评估协议以及不同建模范式的基线和消融实验。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

Conclusion: 提出的方法虽因重叠条件计算导致计算密集，但在分散数据处理方面有显著优势。

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

Motivation: 传统方法构建LS系统求解大规模线性问题不可行，需寻找加速DeepONet训练的有效方法。

Method: 将输出对分支网络最后一层参数线性的部分用最小二乘法优化，其余隐藏层参数用梯度下降更新；分解大LS系统为分支和主干网络两个子问题分别求解；推广到含正则项的L²损失。

Result: 未提及明确结果。

Conclusion: 该方法可解决构建LS系统的难题，且能推广到更广泛的损失类型。

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

Conclusion: 嵌入式平台可实现快速、轻量级且有效的个性化，为实际中可扩展和用户感知的HAR系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

Method: 提出专门用于检测重叠而非相异的相异度量

Result: 方法比对比方法快数倍，能检测重叠簇并避免正交簇合并

Conclusion: 新度量在检测多元高斯聚类重叠方面具有优势

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效连续遗忘，抵御再学习攻击，在遗忘效果和自然性能保留上达最优。

Conclusion: MRP方法能有效解决现有大语言模型安全问题，实现有效连续遗忘和抵御攻击。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Conclusion: 为动态分子开关在神经形态计算架构中作计算单元提供理论支持，可启发更多精确可解模型。

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR - 10的全连接和卷积网络上评估，BaVerLy平均将逐个验证效率提升2.3倍，最高提升4.1倍，将总分析时间从24小时减至6小时。

Conclusion: BaVerLy能有效提升神经网络图像分类器局部鲁棒性验证效率。

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

Conclusion: 双曲几何在蛋白 - 配体建模的两个任务中都有益，可作为强大的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Conclusion: 优化伪任务中的公平性可有效增强结构公平性，FairGuide框架能显著提升图结构公平性，促进公平性在不同下游应用的泛化。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a

Motivation: 解决多用户本地差分隐私训练机制中计算效率和稳定性问题，实现更好的隐私 - 效用权衡。

Method: 提出SPOF机制，对模型训练损失函数的稳定泰勒展开多项式逼近进行扰动，向多项式系数添加校准噪声；对比多用户扩展的DP - SGD。

Result: 与DP - SGD相比，SPOF平均重建精度提高最多3.5%，平均训练时间最多减少57.2%。

Conclusion: SPOF在多用户环境中具有优越的隐私 - 效用权衡。

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

Method: 将校准和分布对齐集成到单端到端可训练模型，利用小批量OT和封闭形式耦合，训练条件归一化流近似OT诱导的后验。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，表现与或超过RoPE及其他标准SBI和非SBI估计器。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可提高可扩展性和在具有挑战性、模型错误指定环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Motivation: 现有动态主题模型需一次性处理全量数据，在线主题模型无长期记忆，要填补持续学习主题模型的空白。

Method: 提出CoNTM，用持续更新的全局先验分布实现持续学习。

Result: CoNTM在主题质量和预测困惑度上始终优于动态主题模型，能在线捕捉主题变化。

Conclusion: CoNTM比现有方法能学习更多样主题，更好捕捉时间变化。

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Result: 在多个真实图异常检测数据集上的实验表明，GRASPED优于当前最先进模型。

Conclusion: GRASPED模型在图节点异常检测任务中表现出色，能有效捕捉异常信息。

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Motivation: 常用机器学习算法难达个体公平，现有改进方法缺正式保证或不能主动增强公平性。

Result: 实验验证方法有效，模型公平且准确，比基于认证训练的方法更高效。

Conclusion: 新框架能在训练中正式保证个体公平性，有实际效果和效率优势。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的群体感知神经架构可为定制药代动力学建模管道提供新选择，有助于实现真正的群体感知个性化给药方案。

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Method: 提出一个让多个自利智能体追求复杂独立目标的环境。

Result: 未提及明确结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Result: 在多个问题上验证了PECANN - CAPU的有效性，与已有的方法和网络方法相比，在所有情况下都能达到有竞争力的精度。

Conclusion: 这些改进提高了PECANN在科学计算中对复杂问题的鲁棒性、效率和适用性。

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

Motivation: 现有通信高效分布式训练算法存在通信瓶颈，在大语言模型预训练中对稀疏化利用不足且量化有限，还会轻微降低性能。

Method: 引入SparseLoCo算法，有效利用Top - k稀疏化和量化，通过误差反馈局部近似外动量，利用稀疏聚合。

Result: 在一系列通信受限的大语言模型训练设置中，SparseLoCo达到1 - 3%的稀疏度和2位量化的极端压缩比，性能优于全精度DiLoCo。

Conclusion: SparseLoCo在性能和通信成本方面都有显著益处。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

Conclusion: 摘要未提及具体结论。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to

TL;DR: 本文提出改进的trie构建算法用于数字进化实验中的系统发育重建，大幅提升了重建速度和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI/ML硬件加速器在运行数字进化实验时存在内存和局部性限制，且从遗传标记重建系统发育的计算时间是大规模系统发育分析的限制因素。

Method: 提出改进的trie构建算法，用于从遗传标记重建系统发育。

Result: 对于10000个节点的树，该算法比现有技术快300倍；使用10亿基因组数据集进行大规模系统发育重建试验，端到端重建时间分别为2.6和2.9小时。

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模数字进化实验中的高通量系统发育分析技术奠定了关键基础。

Abstract: Agent-based simulation platforms play a key role in enabling fast-to-run
evolution experiments that can be precisely controlled and observed in detail.
Availability of high-resolution snapshots of lineage ancestries from digital
experiments, in particular, is key to investigations of evolvability and
open-ended evolution, as well as in providing a validation testbed for
bioinformatics method development. Ongoing advances in AI/ML hardware
accelerator devices, such as the 850,000-processor Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine
(WSE), are poised to broaden the scope of evolutionary questions that can be
investigated in silico. However, constraints in memory capacity and locality
characteristic of these systems introduce difficulties in exhaustively tracking
phylogenies at runtime. To overcome these challenges, recent work on hereditary
stratigraphy algorithms has developed space-efficient genetic markers to
facilitate fully decentralized estimation of relatedness among digital
organisms. However, in existing work, compute time to reconstruct phylogenies
from these genetic markers has proven a limiting factor in achieving
large-scale phyloanalyses. Here, we detail an improved trie-building algorithm
designed to produce reconstructions equivalent to existing approaches. For
modestly-sized 10,000-tip trees, the proposed approach achieves a 300-fold
speedup versus existing state-of-the-art. Finally, using 1 billion genome
datasets drawn from WSE simulations encompassing 954 trillion replication
events, we report a pair of large-scale phylogeny reconstruction trials,
achieving end-to-end reconstruction times of 2.6 and 2.9 hours. In
substantially improving reconstruction scaling and throughput, presented work
establishes a key foundation to enable powerful high-throughput phyloanalysis
techniques in large-scale digital evolution experiments.

Motivation: 探究人类大脑能进行符号推理而多数动物不能的原因。

Method: 进行17次模拟实验，对比有和无多位谓词及结构映射能力的认知架构执行各类任务的表现。

Result: 实验结果与假设一致，即动态绑定、多位谓词和结构映射是基本符号思维的最低要求。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解人类大脑产生符号思维的机制，揭示生物智能与现代机器学习的差异，对仿生人工智能有重要启示。

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.

TL;DR: 本文指出以往APR工具评估存在不足，开发综合评估框架评估Sorald，发现其修复问题时会引入新问题，强调需全面评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究评估APR工具仅关注清除违规，忽略引入新违规、功能改变和结构退化，需开发综合评估框架。

Method: 以Sorald为概念验证，评估其修复从Stack Overflow提取的2393个Java代码片段中30条规则下的3529个SonarQube违规的效果。

Result: Sorald修复特定规则违规时，引入2120个新故障，单元测试失败率达24%，代码结构退化。

Conclusion: 强调需要能全面评估APR工具效果（包括副作用）的评估方法，以确保安全有效采用。

Abstract: In supporting the development of high-quality software, especially necessary
in the era of LLMs, automated program repair (APR) tools aim to improve code
quality by automatically addressing violations detected by static analysis
profilers. Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability
to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes
severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code
structure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess
comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this
research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of
concept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube
violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack
Overflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it
introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code
functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and
degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. Findings
emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum
of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective
adoption.

Conclusion: 需进一步验证和实验，旨在启发未来研究并推动概念框架的实施和完善。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this
conceptual framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型（PLMs）在大规模应用中因计算强度和推理延迟面临挑战，KD技术在代码理解任务中的潜力未充分探索。

Method: 研究涵盖基于logit和基于特征的KD方法，在三个下游任务上对八个学生模型和两个来自不同领域的教师PLM进行实验。

Result: KD比标准微调有显著性能提升；代码特定PLM作教师模型更有效；最新特征基KD方法表现最优，学生模型用5%参数可保留98%教师性能；学生架构与教师架构相似不一定性能更好。

Conclusion: 总结了KD过程和推理中的效率与行为，明确研究发现的意义并指出未来方向。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

Motivation: 现有代码补全优化方法存在权衡问题，在某些数据集或指标上性能提升时其他方面会下降，甚至低于基线模型。

Method: 构建结合AST节点提取和模拟开发者行为启发式的多样数据集；用BM25算法和调用图丰富训练语料；以Seed - Coder - 8B - Base为基础模型进行两阶段训练，先使用Curriculum Learning技术微调，再用通过Rejection Sampling生成偏好对的Direct Preference Optimization进行对齐。

Result: 模型在主流代码补全基准测试中表现出色，精心策划的训练集有效缓解了重复代码问题。

Conclusion: SynthCoder模型集成行业领先实践，在代码补全任务中取得了先进性能。

Abstract: Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this
task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed,
supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However,
these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect
where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied
by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's
performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading
industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct
a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with
heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus
with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call
graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both
file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a
two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model.
First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following
this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results
demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code
completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and
CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the
model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in
various code completion models.

Motivation: 当前评估基于任务的聊天机器人的可靠性、安全性和鲁棒性缺乏大规模高质量数据集，现有自动化质量评估技术存在局限性。

Method: 创建并维护两个数据集，分别是TOFU - R（GitHub上Rasa聊天机器人快照）和BRASATO（根据对话复杂性、功能复杂性和实用性精选的聊天机器人集合）。

Result: 成功提出两个数据集及相关工具支持。

Conclusion: 这两个数据集有助于评估聊天机器人，方便研究聊天机器人的可靠性。

Abstract: Task-based chatbots are increasingly being used to deliver real services, yet
assessing their reliability, security, and robustness remains underexplored,
also due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. The emerging
automated quality assessment techniques targeting chatbots often rely on
limited pools of subjects, such as custom-made toy examples, or outdated, no
longer available, or scarcely popular agents, complicating the evaluation of
such techniques. In this paper, we present two datasets and the tool support
necessary to create and maintain these datasets. The first dataset is RASA
TASK-BASED CHATBOTS FROM GITHUB (TOFU-R), which is a snapshot of the Rasa
chatbots available on GitHub, representing the state of the practice in
open-source chatbot development with Rasa. The second dataset is BOT RASA
COLLECTION (BRASATO), a curated selection of the most relevant chatbots for
dialogue complexity, functional complexity, and utility, whose goal is to ease
reproducibility and facilitate research on chatbot reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
engineering (SE) research and practice, yet their non-determinism, opaque
training data, and evolving architectures complicate the reproduction and
replication of empirical studies. We present a community effort to scope this
space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight
guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The
guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should)
criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our
recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM
usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning;
(3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction
logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7)
to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly
articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility
and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain
the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to
use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).

Motivation: 解决软件可维护性受重视程度与重要性不匹配的问题，通过需求工程解决差距。

Method: 进行行业实践探索性研究，采用设计科学方法开发QUPER - MAn模型。

Result: 确认可维护性是次要质量问题，明确需求常提及编码规范，工具多用于隐式需求；提出QUPER - MAn模型。

Conclusion: QUPER - MAn模型可将可维护性从被忽视的结果转变为积极管理的目标。

Abstract: Maintainable source code is essential for sustainable development in any
software organization. Unfortunately, many studies show that maintainability
often receives less attention than its importance warrants. We argue that
requirements engineering can address this gap the problem by fostering
discussions and setting appropriate targets in a responsible manner. In this
preliminary work, we conducted an exploratory study of industry practices
related to requirements engineering for maintainability. Our findings confirm
previous studies: maintainability remains a second-class quality concern.
Explicit requirements often make sweeping references to coding conventions.
Tools providing maintainability proxies are common but typically only used in
implicit requirements related to engineering practices. To address this, we
propose QUPER-MAn, a maintainability adaption of the QUPER model, which was
originally developed to help organizations set targets for performance
requirements. Developed using a design science approach, QUPER-MAn, integrates
maintainability benchmarks and supports target setting. We posit that it can
shift maintainability from an overlooked development consequence to an actively
managed goal driven by informed and responsible engineering decisions.

TL;DR: 提出测试FPGA逻辑综合工具的新方法VERMEI，含三模块，实验表明其优于现有方法并发现多个新漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPGA逻辑综合工具存在缺陷会带来风险，现有测试方法的测试程序语义和逻辑复杂度不足，需新测试方法。

Method: VERMEI包含预处理、等价变异和漏洞识别三个模块，预处理模块识别僵尸逻辑，等价变异模块生成等价变体，漏洞识别模块基于差分测试找漏洞。

Result: 在Yosys、Vivado和Quartus上实验，VERMEI优于现有方法，五个月内向供应商报告15个漏洞，9个被确认为新漏洞。

Conclusion: VERMEI是一种有效测试FPGA逻辑综合工具的新方法。

Abstract: FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components
in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware
designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level
representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to
unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to
harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed
to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of
insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper,
we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI
consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug
identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code
with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and
coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants
of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It
uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog
designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and
structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing,
compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs.
Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to
vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.

Method: 对信号处理IT团队进行16个月五个行动周期的行动研究，通过分析问卷、观察会议、采用TD - SAGAT及评估积压数据来考察TD意识。

Result: 从业者倾向基于系统演化和成本计算的TD偿还与优先级设定，积压项提醒使TD意识持续提升。

Conclusion: 基于研讨会的方法可行且能带来持续流程改变，还产生适用于其他IT团队的TDM新想法。

Abstract: Context. Technical debt (TD) items are constructs in a software system
providing short-term benefits but hindering future changes. TD management (TDM)
is frequently researched but rarely adopted in practice. Goal. This study aimed
to establish a TDM process in an IT company based on a predefined workshop
concept. We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each
TD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used
action research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates
IT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed
questionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3)
adopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making
situations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data. Results.
Practitioners preferred TD repayment and prioritization based on the system's
evolution and cost calculations, i.e., repayment of so-called low-hanging
fruits. Reminders in the backlog items, such as checkboxes or text templates,
led to a sustainable rise in TD awareness. Conclusions. We showed that a
workshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes.
New ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a
re-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations
for TD prioritization.

Motivation: 对粗糙Heston模型下香草期权进行有效定价，解决前人校准中存在的问题。

Method: 结合Adams方法改进与SINH加速法进行傅里叶反演定价，提出共形自举原则控制误差。

Result: 中等或长期限且行权价接近现货时，数千个价格在几秒内算出，相对误差小；接近到期和深度虚值期权定价也较快；证明SINH加速法更快更准。

Conclusion: 前人校准是“幽灵校准”，共形自举原则和该方法可实现比行业常用方法快数百倍的准确校准。

Abstract: The paper is an extended and modified version of the preprint S.Boyarchenko
and S.Levendorski\u{i} ``Correct implied volatility shapes and reliable pricing
in the rough Heston model". We combine a modification of the Adams method with
the SINH-acceleration method S.Boyarchenko and S.Levendorskii (IJTAF 2019,
v.22) of Fourier inversion (iFT) to price vanilla options under the rough
Heston model. For moderate or long maturities and strikes near spot, thousands
of prices are computed in several milliseconds (ms) in Matlab on a Mac with
moderate specs, with relative errors $\lesssim 10^{-4}$. Even for options close
to expiry and far-OTM, the pricing takes a few tens or hundreds of ms. We show
that, for the calibrated parameters in El Euch and Rosenbaum (Math.Finance
2019, v.29), the model implied vol surface is much flatter and fits the market
data poorly; thus the calibration in op.cit. is a case of ``ghost calibration''
(M.Boyarchenko and S.Levendorski\u{i}, Quant. Finance 2015, v.15): numerical
error and model specification error offset each other, creating an apparently
good fit that vanishes when a more accurate pricer is used. We explain how such
errors arise in popular iFT implementations that use fixed numerical
parameters, yielding spurious smiles/skews, and provide numerical evidence that
SINH acceleration is faster and more accurate than competing methods. Robust
error control is ensured by a general Conformal Bootstrap principle that we
formulate; the principle is applicable to many Fourier-pricing methods. We
outline how this principle and our method enable accurate calibration
procedures that are hundreds of times faster than approaches commonly used in
the industry. Disclaimer: The views expressed herein are those of the authors

Abstract: We propose to use a recently introduced non-parametric tool named
Differentiable Information Imbalance (DII) to identify variables that are
causally related -- potentially through non-linear relationships -- to the
financial returns of the European Union Allowances (EUAs) within the EU
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). We examine data from January 2013 to April
2024 and compare the DII approach with multivariate Granger causality, a
well-known linear approach based on VAR models. We find significant overlap
among the causal variables identified by linear and non-linear methods, such as
the coal futures prices and the IBEX35 index. We also find important
differences between the two causal sets identified. On two synthetic datasets,
we show how these differences could originate from limitations of the linear
methodology.

### [160] [Variable selection for minimum-variance portfolios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14986)
*Guilherme V. Moura,André P. Santos,Hudson S. Torrent*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: 研究ML能否用于最优投资组合变量选择，发现用ML选变量收益大，特定情况下最小方差投资组合表现好，特设稀疏性可能不利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究机器学习是否有助于选择与最优投资组合选择相关的变量。

Method: 将最小方差投资组合权重参数化为大量公司层面特征及其二阶和交叉积变换的函数，共4610个预测因子。

Result: 使用ML选择相关预测因子收益显著，最小方差投资组合风险更低，部分所选预测因子可增加回报。

Conclusion: 特设稀疏性可能损害基于最小方差特征的投资组合的表现。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods have been successfully employed in identifying
variables that can predict the equity premium of individual stocks. In this
paper, we investigate if ML can also be helpful in selecting variables relevant
for optimal portfolio choice. To address this question, we parameterize
minimum-variance portfolio weights as a function of a large pool of firm-level
characteristics as well as their second-order and cross-product
transformations, yielding a total of 4,610 predictors. We find that the gains
from employing ML to select relevant predictors are substantial:
minimum-variance portfolios achieve lower risk relative to sparse
specifications commonly considered in the literature, especially when
non-linear terms are added to the predictor space. Moreover, some of the
selected predictors that help decreasing portfolio risk also increase returns,
leading to minimum-variance portfolios with good performance in terms of Shape
ratios in some situations. Our evidence suggests that ad-hoc sparsity can be
detrimental to the performance of minimum-variance characteristics-based
portfolios.

Motivation: 解决现代投资组合理论中合适的方差 - 协方差矩阵估计问题。

Method: 提出基于深度学习模型的方差 - 协方差矩阵估计框架，使用LSTM - RNN、DeepVAR和GPVAR进行一日前多变量预测，用预测结果优化股票和加密货币投资组合，并对比不同观测窗口和再平衡周期下经典与深度学习方法的表现。

Conclusion: LSTM - RNN模型效果最好，深度学习方法需较长观测窗口，再平衡频率低的策略表现更优。

Abstract: This paper investigates an important problem of an appropriate
variance-covariance matrix estimation in the Modern Portfolio Theory. We
propose a novel framework for variancecovariance matrix estimation for purposes
of the portfolio optimization, which is based on deep learning models. We
employ the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN) along
with two probabilistic deep learning models: DeepVAR and GPVAR to the task of
one-day ahead multivariate forecasting. We then use these forecasts to optimize
portfolios of stocks and cryptocurrencies. Our analysis presents results across
different combinations of observation windows and rebalancing periods to
compare performances of classical and deep learning variance-covariance
estimation methods. The conclusions of the study are that although the
strategies (portfolios) performance differed significantly between different
combinations of parameters, generally the best results in terms of the
information ratio and annualized returns are obtained using the LSTM-RNN
models. Moreover, longer observation windows translate into better performance
of the deep learning models indicating that these methods require longer
windows to be able to efficiently capture the long-term dependencies of the
variance-covariance matrix structure. Strategies with less frequent rebalancing
typically perform better than these with the shortest rebalancing windows
across all considered methods.

Main category: q-fin.RM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究带路径依赖效应的均值 - 方差准则下的最优投资和保险策略。

Method: 使用粗糙波动率模型和带幂核的Hawkes过程捕捉市场路径依赖，添加辅助状态变量将非马尔可夫问题转化为马尔可夫问题，推导路径依赖扩展HJB方程显式解，扩展分数布朗运动的泛函伊藤公式，用四川地震数据估计Hawkes过程参数。

Result: 股票波动率粗糙时个体交易更厌恶风险，考虑灾难性冲击时更追求风险，个体对巨灾保险的需求随路径依赖效应增加。

Conclusion: 忽略路径依赖效应会导致严重的保险不足现象，强调路径依赖效应在巨灾保险定价中的重要性。

Abstract: This paper investigates optimal investment and insurance strategies under a
mean-variance criterion with path-dependent effects. We use a rough volatility
model and a Hawkes process with a power kernel to capture the path dependence
of the market. By adding auxiliary state variables, we degenerate a
non-Markovian problem to a Markovian problem. Next, an explicit solution is
derived for a path-dependent extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation.
Then, we derive the explicit solutions of the problem by extending the
Functional Ito formula for fractional Brownian motion to the general
path-dependent processes, which includes the Hawkes process. In addition, we
use earthquake data from Sichuan Province, China, to estimate parameters for
the Hawkes process. Our numerical results show that the individual becomes more
risk-averse in trading when stock volatility is rough, while more risk-seeking
when considering catastrophic shocks. Moreover, an individual's demand for
catastrophe insurance increases with path-dependent effects. Our findings
indicate that ignoring the path-dependent effect would lead to a significant
underinsurance phenomenon and highlight the importance of the path-dependent
effect in the catastrophe insurance pricing.

*Barbara Dömötör,Ferenc Illés*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: 本文提出基于巴塞尔框架单风险因子模型同时校准所有子投资组合长期违约概率的方法，适用于预算有限机构，无需完整数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银行用内部评级法计算信用风险资本需长期违约概率，但校准模型和历史数据反映当前市场状况，且可用数据常不完整。

Method: 基于巴塞尔框架的单风险因子模型，同时校准所有子投资组合的长期违约概率，仅依赖银行自身违约数据。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于较小的、预算有限的机构，不需要完整数据集，实际中较易满足条件。

Abstract: Banks are required to use long-term default probabilities (PDs) of their
portfolios when calculating credit risk capital under internal ratings-based
(IRB) models. However, the calibration models and historical data typically
reflect prevailing market conditions. According to Basel recommendations,
averaging annual PDs over a full economic cycle should yield the long-term PD.
In practice, the available data are often temporally incomplete - even for
high-risk portfolios. In this paper, we present a method for the simultaneous
calibration of long-term PDs across all sub-portfolios, based on the single
risk factor model embedded in the Basel framework. The method is suitable even
for smaller, budget-constrained institutions, as it relies exclusively on the
bank's own default data. A complete dataset is not required - not even for any
individual sub-portfolio - as the only prerequisite is the presence of
overlapping data before and after the missing values, a mild condition that is
typically met in practical situations.

### [164] [Kernel-based Equalized Odds: A Quantification of Accuracy-Fairness Trade-off in Fair Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15084)
*Yijin Ni,Xiaoming Huo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds
(EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in
supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination
regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for
the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and
interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence
(prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as
equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on
target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned
on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)
and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both
independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive
accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,
thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among
these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,
$\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,
with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for
$\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,
which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus
is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for
principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.

TL;DR: 本文提出通用系统识别工具，融合先验知识和数据信息进行潜状态推理和未知模型部分学习，通过案例展示其广泛适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作在融合不同先验知识与数据信息方面存在挑战，尤其是在含潜系统状态的输入 - 输出设置中。

Result: 得到一个通用系统识别工具，可用于在线和离线贝叶斯推理与学习。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架无需用户定制坐标变换或模型反演，是通用的推理和学习工具，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning
dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works
exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion
of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and
smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in
the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings
with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested
inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task.
This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model
parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge.
The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for
the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline
Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and
implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining
known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system
parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for
efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate
transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework
a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of
the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including
an experimental data set.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文分析经典噪声高斯过程期望改进（GP - EI）算法，给出不同 incumbent 下 GP - EI 的累积遗憾上界，证明其无遗憾特性，并通过实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管期望改进（EI）在贝叶斯优化（BO）应用中经验成功，但 EI 的累积遗憾上界仍是未决问题，需进行理论分析。

Method: 考虑贝叶斯设置，分析三种常用 incumbent（BPMI、BSPMI、BOI）作为 GP - EI 中当前最佳值的情况。

Result: 首次给出 GP - EI 与 BPMI 和 BSPMI 的累积遗憾上界，证明对平方指数和 Matérn 核，GP - EI 是无遗憾算法；首次表明 GP - EI 与 BOI 对平方指数和 Matérn 核要么实现次线性累积遗憾上界，要么有快速收敛的噪声简单遗憾界。

Conclusion: 研究结果为从业者在噪声环境中应用 GP - EI 时选择 incumbent 提供理论指导。

Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition
functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success
in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open
question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected
improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the
objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the
best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent
(BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices
of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the
cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we
show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared
exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time
that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound
or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels.
Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when
practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are
conducted to validate our findings.

Result: 在法国汽车保险数据集上，PIN在预测准确性上优于传统和现代神经网络基准模型，还能洞察特征交互及对预测的贡献。

Conclusion: PIN是一种有效处理表格数据特征交互的方法，具有良好预测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains a key challenge in
predictive modeling, for example, as used for insurance pricing. This paper
proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions
through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the
structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design,
allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for
efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only
involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and
established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural
networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show
that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in
predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact
with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.

Conclusion: 所提出的利用多尺度动力学的采样框架有效，能高效从复杂、未归一化目标分布采样。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for efficient sampling from complex,
unnormalised target distributions by exploiting multiscale dynamics.
Traditional score-based sampling methods either rely on learned approximations
of the score function or involve computationally expensive nested Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) loops. In contrast, the proposed approach leverages
stochastic averaging within a slow-fast system of stochastic differential
equations (SDEs) to estimate intermediate scores along a diffusion path without
training or inner-loop MCMC. Two algorithms are developed under this framework:
MultALMC, which uses multiscale annealed Langevin dynamics, and MultCDiff,
based on multiscale controlled diffusions for the reverse-time
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Both overdamped and underdamped variants are
considered, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the desired diffusion
path. The framework is extended to handle heavy-tailed target distributions
using Student's t-based noise models and tailored fast-process dynamics.
Empirical results across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including
multimodal and high-dimensional distributions, demonstrate that the proposed
methods are competitive with existing samplers in terms of accuracy and
efficiency, without the need for learned models.

Conclusion: CSTEapp使高级统计方法更易获取，能助力各领域研究人员和从业者推动精准医学，改善患者结局。

Abstract: In precision medicine, deriving the individualized treatment rule (ITR) is
crucial for recommending the optimal treatment based on patients' baseline
covariates. The covariate-specific treatment effect (CSTE) curve presents a
graphical method to visualize an ITR within a causal inference framework.
Recent advancements have enhanced the causal interpretation of the CSTE curves
and provided methods for deriving simultaneous confidence bands for various
study types. To facilitate the implementation of these methods and make ITR
estimation more accessible, we developed CSTEapp, a web-based application built
on the R Shiny framework. CSTEapp allows users to upload data and create CSTE
curves through simple point and click operations, making it the first
application for estimating the ITRs. CSTEapp simplifies the analytical process
by providing interactive graphical user interfaces with dynamic results,
enabling users to easily report optimal treatments for individual patients
based on their covariates information. Currently, CSTEapp is applicable to
studies with binary and time-to-event outcomes, and we continually expand its
capabilities to accommodate other outcome types as new methods emerge. We
demonstrate the utility of CSTEapp using real-world examples and simulation
datasets. By making advanced statistical methods more accessible, CSTEapp
empowers researchers and practitioners across various fields to advance
precision medicine and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Sampling from multivariate normal distributions, subjected to a variety of
restrictions, is a problem that is recurrent in statistics and computing. In
the present work, we demonstrate a general framework to efficiently sample a
multivariate normal distribution subject to any set of linear inequality
constraints and/or linear equality constraints simultaneously. In the approach
we detail, sampling a multivariate random variable from the domain formed by
the intersection of linear constraints proceeds via a combination of elliptical
slice sampling to address the inequality constraints, and linear mapping to
address the equality constraints. We also detail a linear programming method
for finding an initial sample on the linearly constrained domain; such a method
is critical for sampling problems where the domain has small probability.
  We demonstrate the validity of our methods on an arbitrarily chosen
four-dimensional multivariate normal distribution subject to five inequality
constraints and/or two equality constraints. Our approach compares favourably
to direct sampling and/or accept-reject sampling methods; the latter methods
vary widely in their efficiency, whereas the methods in the present work are
rejection-free. Where practical we compare predictions of probability density
functions between our sampling methods and analytical computation. For all
simulations we demonstrate that our methods yield accurate computation of the
mean and covariance of the multivariate normal distributions restricted by the
imposed linear constraints. MATLAB codes to implement our methods are readily
available at https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29956304 .

Abstract: Simulating fermionic systems on qubit-based quantum computers often demands
significant computational resources due to the requirement to map fermions to
qubits. Thus, designing a fault-tolerant quantum computer that operates
directly with fermions offers an effective solution to this challenge. Here, we
introduce a protocol for fault-tolerant fermionic quantum computation utilizing
fermion-to-fermion low-density parity-check codes. Our method employs a
fermionic low-density parity-check code memory, which transfers its state to
fermionic color code processors assisted by lattice surgery, where logical
operations are subsequently performed. To construct the fermionic low-density
parity-check memory, we develop a systematic approach for creating fermionic
stabilizer codes based on self-dual Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes. We present
examples demonstrating these codes' significantly improved coding rate compared
to the fermionic color code. Finally, we simulate the dynamics of a fermionic
system using our protocol, illustrating effective error suppression.

Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM)
kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's
functions, which has remained largely unexplored.
  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's
functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always
satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may
also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing
customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite
kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive
accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed
quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing
quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms
face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these
challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir
computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a
reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling
capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical
phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to
the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel
advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and
experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal
simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size
and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first
experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image
classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the
correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and
quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for
quantum reservoir computing and broader quantum machine learning algorithms in

Conclusion: 新方法有效，还研究了保真度选择的影响以进行全面基准测试。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important scheme in active learning
techniques, including applications in predicting quantum chemical properties.
In quantum chemical calculations, there exists the notion of a fidelity, a less
accurate computation is accessible at a cheaper computational cost. This work
proposes a novel low-fidelity informed uncertainty quantification for active
learning with applications in predicting diverse quantum chemical properties
such as excitation energies and \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces.
Computational experiments are carried out in order to assess the proposed
method with results demonstrating that models trained with the novel method
outperform alternatives in terms of empirical error and number of iterations
required. The effect of the choice of fidelity is also studied to perform a
thorough benchmark.

Result: 证实中文在心力衰竭检测中有效，统计测试和分类结果显示个体差异是不准确的主要原因。

Conclusion: 中文可用于心力衰竭检测，个性化“配对层面”分类可作为未来研究的理想基线，个体差异影响检测准确性。

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at
https://github.com/panyue1998/Voice_HF.

TL;DR: 提出用于基于语言模型的文本到语音（TTS）的GOAT框架，可在不依赖大量资源和推理成本的情况下减轻幻觉问题，实验证明其有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于语言模型的TTS系统常生成偏离输入文本的幻觉语音，现有缓解策略存在需大量训练资源或引入显著推理延迟的问题。

Method: 先进行不确定性分析，将TTS生成重新表述为轨迹流优化问题，引入增强的子轨迹平衡目标和强化的内部奖励作为目标分布，还集成奖励温度衰减和学习率优化。

Result: GOAT在具有挑战性的测试用例上减少了超过50%的字符错误率，最多降低了58%的不确定性。

Conclusion: GOAT具有很强的泛化能力和有效性。

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate
hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation
strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant
inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution
AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates
hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost.
Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong
positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on
this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem
and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a
sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward
temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance
balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error
rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%,
demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 枪声检测系统在移动军事车辆上受噪声影响，检测性能下降，需降低声学环境影响。

Method: 选择轻量级神经网络架构，结合两层隐藏层感知器和信号处理技术。

Result: 在噪声均方根值与枪口爆炸峰值幅度相当的情况下，经去噪处理检测率翻倍以上。

Conclusion: 轻量级神经网络结合信号处理技术能有效提高枪声检测系统在复杂声学环境下的检测率。

Abstract: Acoem develops gunshot detection systems, consisting of a microphone array
and software that detects and locates shooters on the battlefield. The
performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment
in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military
vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the
software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network
has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a
lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational
resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as
possible. Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and
appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive
muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the
position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise
of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more
than doubled with this denoising processing.

Abstract: This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion
recognition. Unlike traditional methods, we assume that each audio track is
associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The
study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose
a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion
recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further
model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel
approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution.
The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a
dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding
window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of
Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human
feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified
annotation procedure.

Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven
methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for
respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant
spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by
these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups,
particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable
in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of
significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed
approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the
potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and
improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more
interpretable results.

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims at identifying anomalous sounds from
machines and has gained extensive research interests from both academia and
industry. However, the uncertainty of anomaly location and much redundant
information such as noise in machine sounds hinder the improvement of ASD
system performance. This paper proposes a novel audio feature of filter banks
with evenly distributed intervals, ensuring equal attention to all frequency
ranges in the audio, which enhances the detection of anomalies in machine
sounds. Moreover, based on pre-trained models, this paper presents a
parameter-free feature enhancement approach to remove redundant information in
machine audio. It is believed that this parameter-free strategy facilitates the
effective transfer of universal knowledge from pre-trained tasks to the ASD
task during model fine-tuning. Evaluation results on the Detection and
Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge dataset
demonstrate significant improvements in ASD performance with our proposed
methods.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has recently received a tremendous amount of
interest, leading to a wide range of new theoretical and methodological results
for predictive inference with formal theoretical guarantees. However, the vast
majority of CP methods assume that all units in the training data have fully
observed data on both the outcome and covariates of primary interest, an
assumption that rarely holds in practice. In reality, training data are often
missing the outcome, a subset of covariates, or both on some units. In
addition, time-to-event outcomes in the training set may be censored due to
dropout or administrative end-of-follow-up. Accurately accounting for such
coarsened data in the training sample while fulfilling the primary objective of
well-calibrated conformal predictive inference, requires robustness and
efficiency considerations. In this paper, we consider the general problem of
obtaining distribution-free valid prediction regions for an outcome given
coarsened training data. Leveraging modern semiparametric theory, we achieve
our goal by deriving the efficient influence function of the quantile of the
outcome we aim to predict, under a given semiparametric model for the coarsened
data, carefully combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure. Our
principled use of semiparametric theory has the key advantage of facilitating
flexible machine learning methods such as random forests to learn the
underlying nuisance functions of the semiparametric model. A straightforward
application of the proposed general framework produces prediction intervals
with stronger coverage properties under covariate shift, as well as the
construction of multiply robust prediction sets in monotone missingness
scenarios. We further illustrate the performance of our methods through various
simulation studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集群编排器依赖准确的节点容量和作业需求估计，不准确会导致放置决策不佳和集群性能下降，密集工作负载下CPU上下文切换开销严重影响性能且现有缓解方法浪费资源。

Method: 提出并评估对标准Linux内核调度器的修改，优先考虑任务完成而非低级别的任务公平性。

Result: 实现相同有效性能时，集群规模可减小28%。

Conclusion: 通过修改Linux内核调度器，优先完成任务可减少上下文切换时间，缓解上下文切换开销问题。

Abstract: Cluster orchestrators such as Kubernetes depend on accurate estimates of node
capacity and job requirements. Inaccuracies in either lead to poor placement
decisions and degraded cluster performance. In this paper, we show that in
densely packed workloads, such as serverless applications, CPU context
switching overheads can become so significant that a node's performance is
severely degraded, even when the orchestrator placement is theoretically sound.
In practice this issue is typically mitigated by over-provisioning the cluster,
leading to wasted resources.
  We show that these context switching overhead arise from both an increase in
the average cost of an individual context switch and a higher rate of context
switching, which together amplify overhead multiplicatively when managing large
numbers of concurrent cgroups, Linux's group scheduling mechanism for managing
multi-threaded colocated workloads. We propose and evaluate modifications to
the standard Linux kernel scheduler that mitigate these effects, achieving the
same effective performance with a 28% smaller cluster size. The key insight
behind our approach is to prioritise task completion over low-level per-task
fairness, enabling the scheduler to drain contended CPU run queues more rapidly
and thereby reduce time spent on context switching.

Abstract: Our research investigates the relationship between eco-innovation and
earnings management among 567 firms listed on the FTSE All-Share Index from
2014 to 2022. By examining how sustainability-driven innovation influences
financial reporting practices, we explore the strategic motivations behind
income smoothing in firms engaged in environmental initiatives. The findings
reveal a positive association between eco-innovation and earnings management,
suggesting that firms may leverage ecoinnovation not only for environmental
signalling but also to project financial stability and meet stakeholder
expectations. The analysis further uncovers that the propensity for earnings
management is amplified in firms facing financial constraints, proxied by low
Whited-Wu (WW) scores and weak sales performance, and in those characterised by
high financial opacity. We employ a robust multi-method approach to address
potential endogeneity and selection bias, including entropy balancing,
propensity score matching (PSM), and the Heckman Test correction. Our research
contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the dual
strategic role of ecoinnovation -balancing sustainability signalling with
earnings management, under varying financial conditions. The findings offer
actionable insights for regulators, investors, and policymakers navigating the
intersection of corporate transparency, financial health, and environmental
responsibility.

Abstract: There is a projected increase in offshore wind energy generation in the
United States over the next three decades, driven by legislative commitments
and government funding. Like other renewable technologies, the construction of
offshore wind farms has environmental impacts and spillover effects that must
be assessed. Developing offshore wind as a reliable domestic energy source
requires a multiregional analysis of economic and environmental effects of
constructing projects along lakefronts and coastal regions. Although no
commercial offshore wind farms currently operate in the United States, seven
states have announced capacity commitments exceeding 28 gigawatts by 2035. This
study evaluates the spatial economic and environmental impacts of planned
projects by linking the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Offshore
Renewables Balance-of-system Installation Tool (ORBIT) with a multiregional
input-output model of the U.S. economy developed in the Virtual Industrial
Ecology Lab. ORBIT provides capital investment requirements for installation,
which are combined with the model to estimate economic spillover effects.
Environmental impacts are assessed using a newly developed multiregional
greenhouse gas emissions dataset for the U.S. to capture supply chain emissions
of offshore wind construction. The five projects analyzed require 16.3 billion
dollars in capital investment and generate 27.6 billion dollars in direct and
indirect economic impacts across the country. Emissions results show that
states active in energy generation are most affected, but impacts can be
reduced by decarbonizing the grid. A carbon payback analysis indicates the
projects offset construction-phase emissions in less than a year. The framework
highlights which states experience the greatest spillover effects in terms of
emissions and economic activity required to support offshore wind expansion.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds
substantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However,
many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands,
and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for
synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this
background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can
reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the
use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method
for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we
replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and
compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood
pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and
diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO
Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family
Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and
variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables
relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all
replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications
consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively
low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely
matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential
analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced
both quality and stability of the results.

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach
combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual
field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF
tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,
with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline
<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were
AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined
five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity
per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers.
Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome
measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined
structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299
patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly
and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional
features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo
iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and
inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal
VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only
structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,
respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional
parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.
Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,
highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease
progression.

Result: 在下游属性预测任务中准确率提升约10%；序列生成中，mRNA构建体在Frechet BioDistance指标下逼真度高约4倍，功能属性保留提升约28%；可解释性分析揭示密码子旋转分布与已知GC含量偏差和tRNA丰度模式相符。

Conclusion: Equi - mRNA为mRNA建模建立了新的生物学原则范式，对下一代疗法设计有重要意义。

Abstract: The growing importance of mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology highlights
the need for models that capture the latent structure of synonymous codon
(different triplets encoding the same amino acid) usage, which subtly modulates
translation efficiency and gene expression. While recent efforts incorporate
codon-level inductive biases through auxiliary objectives, they often fall
short of explicitly modeling the structured relationships that arise from the
genetic code's inherent symmetries. We introduce Equi-mRNA, the first
codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous
codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)).
By combining group-theoretic priors with an auxiliary equivariance loss and
symmetry-aware pooling, Equi-mRNA learns biologically grounded representations
that outperform vanilla baselines across multiple axes. On downstream
property-prediction tasks including expression, stability, and riboswitch
switching Equi-mRNA delivers up to approximately 10% improvements in accuracy.
In sequence generation, it produces mRNA constructs that are up to
approximately 4x more realistic under Frechet BioDistance metrics and
approximately 28% better preserve functional properties compared to vanilla
baseline. Interpretability analyses further reveal that learned codon-rotation
distributions recapitulate known GC-content biases and tRNA abundance patterns,
offering novel insights into codon usage. Equi-mRNA establishes a new
biologically principled paradigm for mRNA modeling, with significant
implications for the design of next-generation therapeutics.

Motivation: 规定性价格优化中确定有利价格边界并保证建议价格可靠性是关键挑战，影响优化有效性。

Result: 使用合成价格 - 需求数据集实验，方法能缩小价格范围并保持高收入，物品数量少或需求噪声低时效果好，数据增多优势更显著。

Conclusion: 所提两种估计价格边界的方法有效，能在规定性价格优化中发挥作用。

Abstract: Pricing of products and services, which has a significant impact on consumer
demand, is one of the most important factors in maximizing business profits.
Prescriptive price optimization is a prominent data-driven pricing methodology
consisting of two phases: demand forecasting and price optimization. In the
practice of prescriptive price optimization, the price of each item is
typically set within a predetermined range defined by lower and upper bounds.
Narrow price ranges can lead to missed opportunities, while wide price ranges
run the risk of proposing unrealistic prices; therefore, determining profitable
price bounds while maintaining the reliability of the suggested prices is a
critical challenge that directly affects the effectiveness of prescriptive
price optimization. We propose two methods for estimating price bounds in
prescriptive price optimization so that future total revenue derived from the
optimized prices will be maximized. Our first method for price bounds
estimation uses the bootstrap procedure to estimate confidence intervals for
optimal prices. Our second method uses the Nelder--Mead simplex method for
black-box price bounds optimization that maximizes total revenue estimated
through $K$-fold cross-validation. Experimental results with synthetic
price--demand datasets demonstrate that our methods successfully narrowed down
the price range while maintaining high revenues, particularly when the number
of items was small or the demand noise level was low. Moreover, as more data
accumulated, the comparative advantage of our methods further increased.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN在FPGA硬件触发系统中因计算复杂度和不规则内存访问模式面临严格延迟和资源限制挑战。

Method: 提出JEDI - linear架构消除显式成对交互，采用细粒度量化感知训练和无乘法器乘加运算。

Result: FPGA版JEDI - linear比现有设计延迟低3.7 - 11.5倍，启动间隔低达150倍，LUT使用低达6.2倍，准确率更高，无需DSP块。

Conclusion: 推动下一代触发系统发展，开源模板支持科学应用的可重复性和广泛采用。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have
shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular
memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in
hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply.
In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear
computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by
leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance
hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with
per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free
multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results
show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency,
up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage
compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model
accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast,
state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first
interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets
the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work
advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable,
and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our
open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader
adoption across scientific applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图3D重建在边缘环境下因环境动态性和操作困难产生可靠性问题，影响重建质量。

Method: 提出受投资组合理论启发的边缘资源管理策略，用遗传算法求解优化问题。

Result: 使用公开和定制3D数据集，证明该相机选择策略在时空干扰下比传统基线策略更能保障可靠3D重建。

Conclusion: 所提策略能在相机易受时空相关干扰时保证重建质量。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，在多分辨率下评估YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN，用精度、召回率等指标评估。

Result: YOLOv11在高分辨率下检测精度优于YOLOv12和MTCNN，YOLOv12召回率略好，MTCNN实时推理速度慢。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据不同操作约束选择分辨率感知的人脸检测模型提供了可行的见解。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Conclusion: Soft - argmax不是实现面部地标检测高性能的唯一方式，提出的替代训练目标有效。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

Conclusion: 结合GCN与Voronoi图对推进图像分类有效，拓展了图学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

Motivation: 现有生成模型对抗攻击生成图像质量低、计算资源需求大，扩散模型需大量采样步骤进行对抗生成。

Method: 提出TAIGen方法，仅用3 - 20步从无条件扩散模型生成对抗样本；采用选择性RGB通道策略，在混合步间隔注入扰动。

Result: TAIGen在各测试数据集上PSNR超30 dB；在ImageNet上对不同模型攻击成功率高；生成速度比现有扩散攻击快10倍；实现最低鲁棒准确率。

Conclusion: TAIGen是一种高效的对抗图像生成方法，攻击效果显著，防御机制对其生成图像净化效果差。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

Method: 将CVP任务转化为数学优化问题，展开为多阶段深度网络，每阶段含CORE、CARE、FINE模块，FINE模块引入伯努利扩散模型。

Result: RUN++能有效聚焦模糊区域，显著减少误判。

Conclusion: 提出构建鲁棒CVP系统的新范式并扩展到双级优化框架。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Conclusion: 多模态方法在推进专利分析方面具有前景。

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

Result: 在基准数据集上表现与或超越现有方法，可在个人笔记本进行实验。

Conclusion: RAG - SEG无需传统训练，有竞争力且计算高效，附录对局限性等进行分析。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Conclusion: VideoEraser在文本到视频生成中抑制不良内容方面达到了先进水平。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

Conclusion: ICGS - Quantizer能有效提升3DGS压缩效率，适应存档后场景变化。代码、模型和数据将公开。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project
code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于关键特征引导的黑盒攻击方法CFG，在两个数据集上实验表明其优于现有攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D对抗攻击方法需目标模型信息，现实中难以获取，故聚焦无需目标模型信息的基于迁移的攻击。

Method: 提出CFG方法，通过计算提取特征的重要性来规范对抗点云搜索，优先破坏可能被不同架构采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束生成对抗点云的最大偏差范围。

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG大幅优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的CFG方法能有效提高对抗点云的可迁移性，且具有较好的攻击效果。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型处理长视频能力有限，现有视觉压缩方法在长视频理解和多轮对话场景不实用，存在内存和计算开销大问题。

Method: 提出StreamMem，以流式方式编码新视频帧，利用视觉令牌和通用查询令牌间的注意力分数压缩键值缓存，维持固定大小的键值内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关的键值缓存压缩上达到了最先进水平，与查询感知的压缩方法有竞争力。

Conclusion: StreamMem能有效解决长视频理解中键值缓存的内存和计算开销问题，在相关任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时间自适应（TTA）方法存在依赖反向传播或迭代优化、缺乏类条件特征分布显式建模的问题，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 将TTA重构为高斯概率推理任务，用逐步更新的类均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类条件似然；引入基于CLIP先验和历史知识库的轻量级正则化。

Result: 在不同基准上的大量实验表明，该方法在各种分布偏移下实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法具有良好的可扩展性和鲁棒性，无需源数据、梯度更新和完全访问目标数据，支持在线和直推设置。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Result: 相比独立采样基线和近期推理算法，显著提高了组多样性和质量。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于多种任务，使生成模型能将多个输出视为连贯组而非独立样本。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

Conclusion: NeRD是一种有效的学习机器人动力学模型的方法，能解决现有神经模拟器泛化性不足的问题，缩小模拟与现实的差距。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Conclusion: PIP 方法简单有效，无需额外监督和训练，能提升策略性能并实现更好的迭代策略改进。

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that
unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and
tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents
models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible
results.

Motivation: 解决跨异构控制系统协调工作流的挑战，弥补现有语言模型驱动智能体方法在可扩展性、可靠性和人工监督方面的不足。

Method: 引入Alpha Berkeley框架，包括动态能力分类、先规划后编排模型、上下文感知任务提取和生产就绪执行环境等特性。

Result: 通过风电场监测示例和粒子加速器部署两个案例研究，展示了框架的多功能性。

Conclusion: Alpha Berkeley是高风险领域智能体系统可靠且透明的框架。

Abstract: Coordinating workflows across heterogeneous control systems remains a central
challenge in safety-critical environments such as scientific facilities,
industrial plants, and energy infrastructures. Language-model-driven agents
offer a natural interface for these tasks, but existing approaches often lack
scalability, reliability, and human oversight. We introduce the Alpha Berkeley
Framework, a production-ready architecture for scalable agentic systems that
integrate conversational context with robust tool orchestration. The framework
features dynamic capability classification to select only relevant tools per
task, a plan-first orchestration model that generates execution plans with
explicit dependencies and optional human approval, context-aware task
extraction that combines dialogue history with external memory and domain
resources, and production-ready execution environments with checkpointing,
artifact management, and modular deployment. We demonstrate its versatility
through two case studies: a tutorial-style wind farm monitoring example and a
deployment at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator. These results
establish Alpha Berkeley as a reliable and transparent framework for agentic
systems in high-stakes domains.

### [219] [Software Model Checking via Summary-Guided Search (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15137)
*Ruijie Fang,Zachary Kincaid,Thomas Reps*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文介绍新软件模型检查算法GPS，结合静态分析，有两层搜索策略，引入仪器技术实现完备性，基准测试显示其性能优于现有模型检查器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发更高效的软件模型检查算法，能查找程序安全证明和反例，尤其针对长输入依赖错误路径的程序。

Method: 将程序模型检查任务视为程序状态的有向搜索，由基于组合、摘要的静态分析引导；采用两层搜索策略；引入仪器技术实现完备性。

Result: 在包括SV - COMP和先前文献的基准测试中，GPS在解决的基准数量和运行时间上都优于现有软件模型检查器。

Conclusion: GPS算法是一种高效的软件模型检查算法，在性能上超越了当前的先进水平。

Abstract: In this work, we describe a new software model-checking algorithm called GPS.
GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the
program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The
summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible
paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS
can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs
that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that
renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,
input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense
that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we
introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve
refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked
GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software
Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that
our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers
(including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in
terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.

Motivation: 检测基因 - 基因和基因 - 环境相互作用是复杂性状研究的挑战，高维情况下搜索相互作用受限，需新方法。

Method: 提出U - Statistic-based随机森林方法Forest U - Test。

Result: 模拟研究中Forest U - Test优于现有方法；应用于大麻依赖研究，检测到显著联合关联，p值小于0.001，且在两个独立数据集可重复。

Conclusion: Forest U - Test是用于数量性状遗传关联研究的有效方法。

Abstract: Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants,
environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress
has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex
traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a
great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk
factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise
interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational
intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random
forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association
studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest
approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with
quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest
U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to
study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study
of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was
detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also
replicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17,
respectively.

Motivation: 现有数据集多仅含遗传或表型信息，未整合，限制机器学习模型能力，需解决基因组到表型映射难题。

Method: 构建AGP数据集，将拟南芥基因表达谱与表型性状测量关联，对传统回归和解释性基线进行基准测试。

Result: 得到首个为相同拟南芥样本提供多模态基因信息和异质性状或表型数据的数据集。

Conclusion: AGP数据集有助于研究界利用多源数据准确理解基因型和表型的联系。

Abstract: Understanding which genes control which traits in an organism remains one of
the central challenges in biology. Despite significant advances in data
collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited.
This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including
plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional,
heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many
datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype
information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many
datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are
not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same
biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be
informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of
correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate
predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics
(AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles
with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in
plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and
interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression
and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph
baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and
heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana
specimens. With AGP, we aim to foster the research community towards accurately
understanding the connection between genotypes and phenotypes using gene
information, higher-order gene pairings, and trait data from several sources.

Motivation: 传统地球系统模型准确量化气候极端事件增加风险时计算挑战大，需要高效准确方法。

Method: 提出GEN2生成式预测 - 校正框架，预测步骤为条件高斯模拟器，后接非高斯机器学习校正步骤，机器学习模型在参考数据和向参考数据靠拢的模拟场对上训练。

Result: 在历史ERA5数据验证模型准确性，在不同未来气候变化情景展示外推能力，单情景训练后能准确预测不同情景极端事件统计数据。

Conclusion: 模型能成功外推训练数据分布，有效用于极端事件统计预测。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires
generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of
emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional
Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction
framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event
statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian
emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The
ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields
nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We
first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then
demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change
scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our
model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different
scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私是‘隐私优先’视角，而从业者常是‘效用优先’，之前相关研究局限于基于拉普拉斯或高斯噪声的简单机制，本文旨在推广已有成果。

Method: 将Wu等人和Liu与Talwar的工作拓展以支持任意私有估计器序列，对估计器进行超参数调优，拓展到事后Renyi DP。

Result: 能支持任意私有估计器序列，调参无额外隐私成本，拓展到事后Renyi DP。

Conclusion: 显著推广了‘效用优先’差分隐私机制的成果，拓宽了其适用性。

Abstract: The conventional approach in differential privacy (DP) literature formulates
the privacy-utility trade-off with a "privacy-first" perspective: for a
predetermined level of privacy, a certain utility is achievable. However,
practitioners often operate under a "utility-first" paradigm, prioritizing a
desired level of utility and then determining the corresponding privacy cost.
  Wu et al. [2019] initiated a formal study of this "utility-first" perspective
by introducing ex-post DP. They demonstrated that by adding correlated Laplace
noise and progressively reducing it on demand, a sequence of increasingly
accurate estimates of a private parameter can be generated, with the privacy
cost attributed only to the least noisy iterate released. This led to a Laplace
mechanism variant that achieves a specified utility with minimal privacy loss.
However, their work, and similar findings by Whitehouse et al. [2022], are
primarily limited to simple mechanisms based on Laplace or Gaussian noise.
  In this paper, we significantly generalize these results. In particular, we
extend the work of Wu et al. [2019] and Liu and Talwar [2019] to support any
sequence of private estimators, incurring at most a doubling of the original
privacy budget. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hyperparameter tuning for
these estimators, including the selection of an optimal privacy budget, can be
performed without additional privacy cost. Finally, we extend our results to
ex-post Renyi DP, further broadening the applicability of utility-first privacy
mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文建立LLVM前向边CFI变体与内存损坏漏洞类别的分类映射，评估CFI对部分CVE的效果，为CFI部署提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内存损坏漏洞威胁大，CFI可缓解但开发者缺少在现实软件中应用的指导。

Method: 建立分类映射，基于Top 10 KEV列表确定四个高影响漏洞类别并各选一个代表CVE，评估LLVM的CFI对这些CVE的效果。

Result: CFI在两个CVE案例中阻止了利用，在另外两个案例中失败。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持开发者做出明智的部署决策，为提高CFI在生产系统中的实际应用提供基础。

Abstract: Memory corruption vulnerabilities remain one of the most severe threats to
software security. They often allow attackers to achieve arbitrary code
execution by redirecting a vulnerable program's control flow. While Control
Flow Integrity (CFI) has gained traction to mitigate this exploitation path,
developers are not provided with any direction on how to apply CFI to
real-world software. In this work, we establish a taxonomy mapping LLVM's
forward-edge CFI variants to memory corruption vulnerability classes, offering
actionable guidance for developers seeking to deploy CFI incrementally in
existing codebases. Based on the Top 10 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)
list, we identify four high-impact vulnerability categories and select one
representative CVE for each. We evaluate LLVM's CFI against each CVE and
explain why CFI blocks exploitation in two cases while failing in the other
two, illustrating its potential and current limitations. Our findings support
informed deployment decisions and provide a foundation for improving the
practical use of CFI in production systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统易受数据投毒攻击，攻击者资源受限，现有利用伪造文本评论的方法质量不佳，需解决生成高质量伪造用户资料的难题。

Method: 利用多模态基础模型的上下文学习能力，引入演示检索算法和文本风格转换策略增强朴素上下文学习，提出RAGAN框架，通过越狱器生成资料，并在指令代理和监护人上协同优化。

Result: 在各种真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，RAGAN达到了最先进的投毒攻击性能。

Conclusion: RAGAN框架能够生成高质量的伪造用户资料，可用于评估推荐系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and
utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial
computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted
their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have
addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable
access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this
accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also
introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs).
Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate
a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces,
posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this
paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense
strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to
attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis
covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights
challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off
between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs
within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical,
legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future
research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for
researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and
privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated
with related literature at https://github.com/kzhao5/ModelExtractionPapers.

Motivation: 现代AI模型规模扩大，MoE架构在平衡性能与成本时存在隐私风险，需进行安全分析。

Method: 提出MoEcho，在不同计算平台引入四种架构侧信道，并基于此提出四种攻击方法。

Result: 成功提出四种攻击方法，可有效在基于MoE架构的大语言模型和视觉语言模型中侵犯用户隐私。

Conclusion: MoE结构存在严重安全和隐私威胁，开发大规模AI服务时需有效及时的防护措施。

Abstract: The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling
remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing,
computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale
explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical
challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating
specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model
accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE
architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized
experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack
surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave
distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which
adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we
propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that
compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we
introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing
platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and
Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user
privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based
on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack,
Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first
runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure
common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy
threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE
based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.

TL;DR: 本文引入MCPTox基准评估LLM代理对工具中毒攻击的鲁棒性，发现代理普遍易受攻击，现有安全对齐无效，发布MCPTox数据集。


<details>

Motivation: MCP因外部工具产生新攻击面，此前聚焦工具输出攻击，本文研究工具元数据中嵌入恶意指令的工具中毒威胁且缺乏系统大规模评估。

Method: 构建基于45个真实MCP服务器和353个真实工具的MCPTox基准，设计三种攻击模板通过少样本学习生成1312个恶意测试用例。

Result: 对20个知名LLM代理评估发现普遍易受工具中毒攻击，能力更强的模型更易受攻击，代理很少拒绝攻击，现有安全对齐无效。

Conclusion: 研究为理解和缓解威胁提供实证基线，发布MCPTox推动更安全AI代理开发。

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with
external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a
cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel
attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused
on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more
fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are
embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has
been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,
large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent
robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is
constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To
achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a
comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering
10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents
setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,
achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models
are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior
instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals
that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment
is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for
unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for
understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for
the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an
anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型代理应对间接提示注入攻击防御不足，提出IPIGuard范式，实验显示其在有效性和鲁棒性上取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖模型固有安全假设，缺乏对代理行为的结构约束，易受更强攻击，需在源头上防止恶意工具调用。

Method: 提出IPIGuard防御任务执行范式，将代理任务执行过程建模为在工具依赖图上的遍历，解耦动作规划与外部数据交互。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，IPIGuard在有效性和鲁棒性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: IPIGuard为动态环境中更安全的代理系统发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布偏移对深度学习异常检测系统构成挑战，现有系统难以适应，有监督学习需手动标注，无监督学习需干净数据，实际中难以满足要求。

Method: 引入NetSight框架，通过新颖的伪标签技术消除人工干预，采用基于知识蒸馏的适应策略防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在三个长期网络数据集上评估，NetSight相比依赖手动标注的先进方法，F1分数提升最高达11.72%。

Conclusion: NetSight在经历分布偏移的动态网络中具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time,
poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems.
Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts.
Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual
labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which
is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are
challenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a
framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually
detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight
eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and
uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight
demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to
11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that
experience distribution shifts over time.

TL;DR: 本文提出联邦无学习场景下的首个后门攻击BadFU，验证其有效性并指出当前联邦无学习实践的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据隐私和合规需求增长，联邦学习中集成无学习有新挑战和安全风险，对手可能利用无学习过程破坏全局模型完整性。

Method: 提出BadFU攻击策略，恶意客户端在联邦训练时用后门和伪装样本正常训练全局模型，请求移除伪装样本时使模型进入后门状态。

Result: 在各种联邦学习框架和无学习策略下的大量实验验证了BadFU的有效性。

Conclusion: 当前联邦无学习实践存在关键漏洞，亟需更安全稳健的机制。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training
paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model
without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory
compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the
federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,
integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely
unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the
unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this
paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated
unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the
global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we
propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor
and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated
training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage
samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive
experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the
effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated
unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and
robust federated unlearning mechanisms.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to serve as a foundational
capability across the entire lifecycle of 6G networks, spanning design,
deployment, and operation. This article proposes a native AI-driven air
interface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and
adaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and
extract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task
relevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation
allows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across
diverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and
robustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface
architecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by
a case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally,
it presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G,
outlining key challenges and research opportunities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究集成感知、通信和计算的空中联合边缘学习系统的收敛行为，优化系统性能。

Method: 分析收敛行为，考虑无线传感噪声和空中计算失真；设计ISCC参数，通过交替优化批量大小控制和网络资源分配推导低复杂度算法。

Result: 理论表明感知、通信和计算竞争网络资源共同决定收敛速度；实验验证理论分析，算法协调各环节提升学习性能。

Conclusion: 提出的低复杂度ISCC算法能有效协调感知、通信和计算的批量大小控制与资源分配，增强学习性能。

Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system
with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one
edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects
and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for
recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is
employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this
setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in
terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the
wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp
distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically
shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network
resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we
design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function
degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The
challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and
computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a
low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control
and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less
sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained
and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed
of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.
Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the
theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well
coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,
communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.

Conclusion: 该模块化FPGA框架为光谱学和显微镜学中对延迟敏感的成像工作流提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with
Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional
real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based
preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level
Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture
performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data,
minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel
operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing
dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale
acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.
Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement
in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to
existing baselines.

Abstract: Transformer models and end-to-end learning frameworks are rapidly
revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence. In this work, we apply
object detection transformers to analyze charge stability diagrams in
semiconductor quantum dot arrays, a key task for achieving scalability with
spin-based quantum computing. Specifically, our model identifies triple points

Motivation: 探究人类社会从众心理机制是否适用于大语言模型，明确其从众行为的驱动因素。

Method: 采用行为经济学的信息级联范式，在三种决策场景中操纵信息不确定性，评估九个领先的大语言模型。

Result: 信息影响是模型在各场景下行为的基础机制，准确性和信心随证据增强而上升；不确定性对该机制有显著调节作用，低到中等不确定性下模型采用保守策略，高不确定性下模型出现类似规范放大现象。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的社会从众行为受信息影响驱动，且该机制受不确定性调节，与人类机制可能存在差异。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) integrate into collaborative teams, their
social conformity -- the tendency to align with majority opinions -- has
emerged as a key concern. In humans, conformity arises from informational
influence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence
(social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by
shifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear
whether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts
the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively
disentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated
nine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal,
investment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70,
respectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the
models' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently
rising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is
dramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios,
this informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs
systematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty
triggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models
additionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight
public signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81).

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly impacts professional practice,
there is a growing need to AI-related competencies into higher education
curricula. However, research on the implementation of AI education within study
programs remains limited and requires new forms of collaboration across
disciplines. This study addresses this gap and explores perspectives on
interdisciplinary curriculum development through the lens of different
stakeholders. In particular, we examine the case of curriculum development for
a novel undergraduate program in AI in engineering. The research uses a mixed
methods approach, combining quantitative curriculum mapping with qualitative
focus group interviews. In addition to assessing the alignment of the
curriculum with the targeted competencies, the study also examines the
perceived quality, consistency, practicality and effectiveness from both
academic and industry perspectives, as well as differences in perceptions
between educators who were involved in the development and those who were not.
The findings provide a practical understanding of the outcomes of
interdisciplinary AI curriculum development and contribute to a broader
understanding of how educator participation in curriculum development
influences perceptions of quality aspects. It also advances the field of AI
education by providing a reference point and insights for further
interdisciplinary curriculum developments in response to evolving industry
needs.

Conclusion: GenSIM具备外推能力，凸显生成式模型在未知气候下的泛化能力和编码隐藏物理机制的潜力。

Abstract: Sea ice is governed by highly complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic
processes that are challenging to represent in Earth system models. While
advanced numerical models have improved our understanding of the sea-ice
dynamics, their computational costs often limit their application in ensemble
forecasting and climate simulations. Here, we introduce GenSIM, the first
generative AI-based pan-Arctic model that predicts the evolution of all
relevant key properties, including concentration, thickness, and drift, in a
12-hour window with improved accuracy over deterministic predictions and high
computational efficiency, while remaining physically consistent. Trained on a
long simulation from a state-of-the-art sea-ice--ocean system, GenSIM robustly
reproduces statistics as observed in numerical models and observations,
exhibiting brittle-like short-term dynamics while also depicting the long-term
sea-ice decline. Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's
emergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term
impact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This
ability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term
predictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise
for unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.

Motivation: 当前基于AI的模型在预测极端天气事件的能力不明，需探究其在破纪录极端天气预测上的表现。

Method: 对比欧洲中期天气预报中心的数值模型HRES与多个先进AI模型在破纪录极端天气预测上的表现。

Result: HRES在破纪录极端天气预测上始终优于AI模型，AI模型预测误差更大，且倾向于低估破纪录事件的频率和强度，对冷热纪录预测有偏差。

Conclusion: AI天气模型在超出训练范围预测及破纪录极端天气预测上有局限性，在高风险应用中需进一步验证和开发。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models are revolutionizing weather
forecasting and have surpassed leading numerical weather prediction systems on
various benchmark tasks. However, their ability to extrapolate and reliably
forecast unprecedented extreme events remains unclear. Here, we show that for
record-breaking weather extremes, the numerical model High RESolution forecast
(HRES) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts still
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AI models GraphCast, GraphCast
operational, Pangu-Weather, Pangu-Weather operational, and Fuxi. We demonstrate
that forecast errors in AI models are consistently larger for record-breaking
heat, cold, and wind than in HRES across nearly all lead times. We further find
that the examined AI models tend to underestimate both the frequency and
intensity of record-breaking events, and they underpredict hot records and
overestimate cold records with growing errors for larger record exceedance. Our
findings underscore the current limitations of AI weather models in
extrapolating beyond their training domain and in forecasting the potentially
most impactful record-breaking weather events that are particularly frequent in
a rapidly warming climate. Further rigorous verification and model development
is needed before these models can be solely relied upon for high-stakes
applications such as early warning systems and disaster management.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for
predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification
framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation.
Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient
Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC
and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and
0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower
but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with
scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor
performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data
patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible
number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding
accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the
power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out
the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset
characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on
the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to
further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.

Conclusion: 标签置信度是有价值的信号，合理利用可增强医学影像AI的可靠性和临床实用性。

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation
significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and
subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing
research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a
lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a
tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation
method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while
reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by
96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an
impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged
and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool
(available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers
to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on
TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental
results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher
classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue
images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available
tongue image segmentation tool.

Abstract: This study comprehensively explores knowledge distillation frameworks for

compact, hardware-aware student model derived from the OFA-595 supernet. Our
approach leverages hybrid supervision, combining ground-truth labels with
teacher models' soft targets to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.
We validate our models on two benchmark datasets: COVID-QU-Ex and LCS25000,
covering multiple classes, including COVID-19, healthy, non-COVID pneumonia,
lung, and colon cancer. To interpret the spatial focus of the models, we employ
Score-CAM-based visualizations, which provide insight into the reasoning
process of both teacher and student networks. The results demonstrate that the
distilled student model maintains high classification performance with
significantly reduced parameters and inference time, making it an optimal

Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive
quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical
application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly
affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based
super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but
challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated
strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical
super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains
unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training
instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based
super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using
patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic
images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was
implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla,
Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN
improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical
for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved
unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%),
a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the
generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings
highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI,
particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need
for careful selection of adversarial strategies.

TL;DR: 提出动态、不确定性感知的MRI采集框架，按需调整扫描时间，减少扫描时间并提供精度保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习加速MRI忽略重建不确定性，固定加速因子导致扫描时间不合理或图像质量不足。

Method: 利用概率重建模型估计图像不确定性，通过共形预测转化为置信区间，迭代采样、更新重建并评估，满足精度目标时自动终止扫描。

Result: 在膝部和心脏MRI数据集上验证，自适应方法减少扫描时间，提供统计精度保证。

Conclusion: 该框架超越固定加速因子，实现患者特定采集，平衡扫描效率和诊断信心，是迈向个性化高效MRI的关键一步。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but
is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based
accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from
undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with
infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical
tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as
acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are
either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical
endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition
framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a
probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then
propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of
interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use
conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated
confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively
samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence
interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a
user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and
cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach
reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal
statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework
moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions
that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step
towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.

Abstract: Clinical cystoscopy, the current standard for bladder cancer diagnosis,
suffers from significant reliance on physician expertise, leading to
variability and subjectivity in diagnostic outcomes. There is an urgent need
for objective, accurate, and efficient computational approaches to improve
bladder cancer diagnostics.
  Leveraging recent advancements in deep learning, this study proposes an
integrated multi-task deep learning framework specifically designed for bladder
cancer diagnosis from cystoscopic images. Our framework includes a robust
classification model using EfficientNet-B0 enhanced with Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM), an advanced segmentation model based on
ResNet34-UNet++ architecture with self-attention mechanisms and attention
gating, and molecular subtyping using ConvNeXt-Tiny to classify molecular
markers such as HER-2 and Ki-67. Additionally, we introduce a Gradio-based
online diagnostic platform integrating all developed models, providing
intuitive features including multi-format image uploads, bilingual interfaces,
and dynamic threshold adjustments.
  Extensive experimentation demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods,
achieving outstanding accuracy (93.28%), F1-score (82.05%), and AUC (96.41%)
for classification tasks, and exceptional segmentation performance indicated by
a Dice coefficient of 0.9091. The online platform significantly improved the
accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of clinical bladder cancer diagnostics,
enabling practical and user-friendly deployment. The code is publicly
available.
  Our multi-task framework and integrated online tool collectively advance the
field of intelligent bladder cancer diagnosis by improving clinical
reliability, supporting early tumor detection, and enabling real-time
diagnostic feedback. These contributions mark a significant step toward
AI-assisted decision-making in urology.

Conclusion: 虚拟双能减影图像生成潜力大，未来进步可能缩小与真实图像的性能差距，使其临床应用可行。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

Abstract: Realisation of significant advances in capabilities of sensors, computing,
timing, and communication enabled by quantum technologies is dependent on
engineering highly complex systems that integrate quantum devices into existing
classical infrastructure. A systems engineering approach is considered to
address the growing need for quantum-secure telecommunications that overcome
the threat to encryption caused by maturing quantum computation. This work
explores a range of existing and future quantum communication networks,
specifically quantum key distribution network proposals, to model and
demonstrate the evolution of quantum key distribution network architectures.
Leveraging Orthogonal Variability Modelling and Systems Modelling Language as
candidate modelling languages, the study creates traceable artefacts to promote
modular architectures that are reusable for future studies. We propose a
variability-driven framework for managing fast-evolving network architectures
with respect to increasing stakeholder expectations. The result contributes to
the systematic development of viable quantum key distribution networks and
supports the investigation of similar integration challenges relevant to the
broader context of quantum systems engineering.

Motivation: 解决关于4×4满秩矩阵能否表示为两个秩2矩阵的Hadamard积的开放性问题。

Method: 在𝔽₂上进行穷举搜索，通过符号枚举验证在ℤ上的反例有效性，提供在ℝ上的数值证据，使用现代机器学习技术。

Result: 在20160个满秩二进制矩阵中找到5304个反例（26.3%）；矩阵密度对可表示性的分类准确率达95.7%；可表示矩阵位于16维环境空间中约10维的簇上。

Conclusion: 存在支配Hadamard因子分解性的深层代数约束。

Abstract: We computationally resolve an open problem concerning the expressibility of
$4 \times 4$ full-rank matrices as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices.
Through exhaustive search over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we identify 5,304
counterexamples among the 20,160 full-rank binary matrices (26.3\%). We verify
that these counterexamples remain valid over $\mathbb{Z}$ through sign
enumeration and provide strong numerical evidence for their validity over
$\mathbb{R}$.
  Remarkably, our analysis reveals that matrix density (number of ones) is
highly predictive of expressibility, achieving 95.7\% classification accuracy.
Using modern machine learning techniques, we discover that expressible matrices
lie on an approximately 10-dimensional variety within the 16-dimensional
ambient space, despite the naive parameter count of 24 (12 parameters each for
two $4 \times 4$ rank-2 matrices). This emergent low-dimensional structure
suggests deep algebraic constraints governing Hadamard factorizability.

Conclusion: 所提方法在诱导正交性和改善函数分量估计方面性能优越。

Abstract: We propose a novel class of prior distributions for sequences of orthogonal
functions, which are frequently required in various statistical models such as
functional principal component analysis (FPCA). Our approach constructs priors
sequentially by imposing adaptive orthogonality constraints through a
hierarchical formulation of conditionally normal distributions. The
orthogonality is controlled via hyperparameters, allowing for flexible
trade-offs between exactness and smoothness, which can be learned from the
observed data. We illustrate the properties of the proposed prior and show that
it leads to nearly orthogonal posterior estimates. The proposed prior is
employed in Bayesian FPCA, providing more interpretable principal functions and
efficient low-rank representations. Through simulation studies and analysis of
human mobility data in Tokyo, we demonstrate the superior performance of our
approach in inducing orthogonality and improving functional component
estimation.

Abstract: Pre-trained machine learning (ML) predictions have been increasingly used to
complement incomplete data to enable downstream scientific inquiries, but their
naive integration risks biased inferences. Recently, multiple methods have been
developed to provide valid inference with ML imputations regardless of
prediction quality and to enhance efficiency relative to complete-case
analyses. However, existing approaches are often limited to missing outcomes
under a missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) assumption, failing to handle
general missingness patterns under the more realistic missing-at-random (MAR)
assumption. This paper develops a novel method which delivers valid statistical
inference framework for general Z-estimation problems using ML imputations
under the MAR assumption and for general missingness patterns. The core
technical idea is to stratify observations by distinct missingness patterns and
construct an estimator by appropriately weighting and aggregating
pattern-specific information through a masking-and-imputation procedure on the
complete cases. We provide theoretical guarantees of asymptotic normality of
the proposed estimator and efficiency dominance over weighted complete-case
analyses. Practically, the method affords simple implementations by leveraging
existing weighted complete-case analysis software. Extensive simulations are
carried out to validate theoretical results. The paper concludes with a brief
discussion on practical implications, limitations, and potential future
directions.

Abstract: Continual learning is motivated by the need to adapt to real-world dynamics
in tasks and data distribution while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Despite significant advances in continual learning techniques, the theoretical
understanding of their generalization performance lags behind. This paper
examines the theoretical properties of continual ridge regression in
high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension is proportional to the
sample size in each task. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact
expressions of the asymptotic prediction risk, thereby enabling the
characterization of three evaluation metrics of generalization performance in
continual learning: average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer.
Furthermore, we present the theoretical risk curves to illustrate the trends in
these evaluation metrics throughout the continual learning process. Our
analysis reveals several intriguing phenomena in the risk curves, demonstrating
how model specifications influence the generalization performance. Simulation
studies are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: The RDD (regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for
identification and estimation of causal effects at a cutoff of a single running
variable. Practical settings, in particular those encountered in production
systems, often involve decision-making defined by multiple thresholds and
criteria. Common MRD (multi-score RDD) approaches transform these to a
one-dimensional design, to employ identification and estimation results.
However, this practice can introduce non-compliant behavior. We develop
theoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this "fuzziness" when
estimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules. We provide a sound
definition and categorization of unit behavior types for multi-dimensional
cutoff-rules, extending existing categorizations. We identify conditions for
the existence and identification of the cutoff-effect on complier in multiple
dimensions, and specify when identification remains stable after excluding
nevertaker and alwaystaker. Further, we investigate how decomposing
cutoff-rules into simpler parts alters the unit behavior. This allows
identification and removal of non-compliant units potentially improving
estimates. We validate our framework on simulated and real-world data from
opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Our empirical results demonstrate
the usability for refining production policies. Particularly we show that our
approach decreases the estimation variance, highlighting the practical value of
the MRD framework in manufacturing.

Conclusion: GenTune能有效增强人机协作，提升图像细化效果，优于当前实践。

Abstract: Environment designers in the entertainment industry create imaginative 2D and
3D scenes for games, films, and television, requiring both fine-grained control
of specific details and consistent global coherence. Designers have
increasingly integrated generative AI into their workflows, often relying on
large language models (LLMs) to expand user prompts for text-to-image
generation, then iteratively refining those prompts and applying inpainting.
However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1)
the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate
the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while
inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency
and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that
enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to
image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a
generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise
those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a
summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image
comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction
(all $p < .01$) compared to current practice. A follow-up field study with two
studios further demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world settings.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis stands at the forefront of neuroscience
and artificial intelligence research, where foundation models are reshaping the
traditional EEG analysis paradigm by leveraging their powerful representational
capacity and cross-modal generalization. However, the rapid proliferation of
these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by
diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic
categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive
modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis,
systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the
native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal
frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical
foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges
such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world
applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work
not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but
accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable,
interpretable, and online actionable solutions.

Motivation: 解决基于文本到图像的扩散模型中的偏见问题，且让去偏方法更易被广泛从业者使用。

Method: 改变扩散过程以避开有偏见概念的潜在维度区域，仅改变推理过程。

Result: 通过对护士、消防员和CEO概念进行性别、种族和年龄去偏，人工评估1200张生成图像，结果表明方法有效缓解偏见，GPT4o自动评估与人工评估无显著差异。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力显著提高基于扩散的文本到图像生成模型所生成图像的多样性。

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

TL;DR: 介绍首个评估小语言模型（SLMs）的基准SLM - Bench，评估多个维度，得出SLMs存在多样权衡，为评估设新标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对小语言模型性能和环境影响的系统评估。

Method: 引入SLM - Bench，在4种硬件配置上用23个数据集对15个SLM在9个NLP任务上评估，量化11个指标，开发开源基准测试管道。

Result: 发现SLMs存在多样权衡，部分模型精度高，部分模型能源效率高。

Conclusion: SLM - Bench为SLM评估设定新标准，弥合资源效率与实际应用的差距。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LongRecall框架评估长文本召回率，在基准测试中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有召回指标依赖词汇重叠有误差，LLM - as - a - Judge方法有对齐和幻觉问题，需更优召回评估方法。

Method: 引入三阶段召回评估框架LongRecall，分解答案为独立事实，通过词汇和语义过滤缩小候选匹配，用结构化蕴含检查验证对齐。

Result: 在三个长文本问答基准测试中，相比强词汇和LLM - as - a - Judge基线，召回准确率有显著提升。

Conclusion: LongRecall减少了误报和漏报，能适应多样表述和语境变化，可作为系统召回评估的基础模块。

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言中事件时间背景常不明确，现有大语言模型在处理时间常识推理任务上存在困难，自动挖掘事件时间常识可创建更强大语言模型。

Method: 研究大语言模型从文本中提取时间常识的能力，评估多种实验设置；提出时间常识提取流程，利用大语言模型自动挖掘时间常识，基于SAMSum和RealNews语料构建TComQA数据集并进行众包验证。

Result: TComQA数据集在提取时间常识上达到超80%的精度；用TComQA训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于在现有数据集微调的大语言模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的利用大语言模型自动挖掘时间常识的方法可行，构建的TComQA数据集有效，能提升模型在时间常识推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

Conclusion: 综述生成任务复杂，有必要持续研究，且开源了代码、数据和模型。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

Motivation: 孟加拉语是全球第七大语言，但数字资源不足，词干提取对其语言分析很重要，而现有研究存在诸多问题。

Method: 对孟加拉语词干提取方法进行全面调查，分析现有研究的情况。

Result: 发现现有文献存在显著差距，评估方法有问题，缺乏可复现的实现。

Conclusion: 倡导开发强大的孟加拉语词干提取器，持续开展该领域研究以提升语言分析和处理能力。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出统一协同训练框架解决大语言模型内容安全方法局限，实验显示效果好且降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型内容安全方法依赖多阶段训练管道，缺乏细粒度和部署后可控性。

Method: 提出统一协同训练框架，在单个监督微调阶段集成多种安全行为，通过系统级指令或魔法令牌动态激活行为。

Result: 方法安全对齐质量与SFT + DPO相当，8B模型安全性能超DeepSeek - R1(671B)，降低训练复杂度和部署成本。

Conclusion: 该工作为大语言模型内容安全提供可扩展、高效且高度可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型因自回归特性在处理幻觉和复杂推理问题时存在困难，本文旨在解决结构化预测方面的这些问题。

Method: 将大语言模型与组合推理相结合，通过大量实验探究能有效估计大语言模型置信值的提示策略。

Result: 无论提示策略如何，在提示基础上添加符号推理能得到更一致和准确的预测；使用结构化预测目标进行校准和微调可提升具有挑战性任务的性能。

Conclusion: 在大语言模型时代，结构化学习仍有价值。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学数据集因提取方法不佳质量下降，需构建高质量数学语料提升大语言模型推理能力。

Method: 用领域无关的新管道，利用布局感知渲染和基于大语言模型的清理阶段，从Common Crawl提取科学文本。

Result: 收集了大语料Nemotron - CC - Math - 3+和Nemotron - CC - Math - 4+，后者优于其他公开数据集；预训练模型在数学、代码和通用推理上有提升。

Conclusion: 首个可靠从网络数据提取科学内容的管道，设公开数学预训练语料新标杆，开源代码和数据支持开源工作。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出语义感知分词框架SemToken，可减少分词冗余、提高计算效率，实验显示有良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法仅基于频率统计，忽略语义结构，导致长文本场景中分词冗余和上下文连贯性利用不足。

Method: 先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入并进行局部语义聚类，再根据语义密度分配不同粒度分词，且可与现代语言模型和注意力加速方法集成。

Result: 在长文本语言建模基准测试中，SemToken可使分词数量最多减少2.4倍，速度提升1.9倍，困惑度和下游准确率无明显下降。

Conclusion: 语义结构为大语言模型的分词和计算优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

Method: 提出SPARK方法，在通道级对KV进行剪枝应用非结构化稀疏性，并在注意力分数计算时动态恢复剪枝条目，且可与现有方法集成。

Result: 能在相同内存预算下处理更长序列，对相同长度序列减少KV缓存存储超30%，80%剪枝率时性能下降小于5%。

Conclusion: SPARK方法具有鲁棒性和有效性，可进一步加速大语言模型长上下文推理。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在边缘设备部署时内存限制是关键瓶颈，现有静态词汇剪枝有信息损失和缺乏灵活性的问题。

Method: 基于词汇局部性原则和组件计算特征不对称，引入VocabTailor框架，通过卸载嵌入和采用混合静态 - 动态词汇选择策略。

Result: 在不同下游任务实验中，VocabTailor能将词汇相关组件内存使用最多减少99%，任务性能无明显下降。

Conclusion: VocabTailor显著优于现有静态词汇剪枝方法。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

TL;DR: 提出CARE方法解决RAG中上下文-内存冲突问题，实验显示有效提升性能。


<details>

Motivation: RAG在上下文与大语言模型参数知识冲突时，难以解决上下文-内存冲突问题。

Method: 引入CARE，包含上下文评估器和基础大语言模型，上下文评估器编码记忆令牌嵌入，通过接地/对抗软提示训练以识别不可靠上下文。

Result: CARE有效缓解上下文-内存冲突，在问答和事实核查基准上平均性能提升5.0%。

Conclusion: CARE为可靠和自适应的RAG系统建立了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

TL;DR: 文章介绍首个全开放的端到端大规模语音语言建模框架LLaSO，提供关键资源，构建参考模型验证框架，指出训练覆盖与泛化问题，推动领域研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语音语言模型（LSLMs）架构碎片化、缺乏透明度，模型权重发布时缺少对应训练数据和配置，阻碍研究的系统比较和可重复性。

Method: 引入LLaSO框架，提供LLaSO - Align语料库、LLaSO - Instruct数据集和LLaSO - Eval基准，构建并发布LLaSO - Base参考模型。

Result: LLaSO - Base模型取得0.72的归一化分数，超越可比模型，但在未见任务尤其是纯音频场景存在泛化差距。

Conclusion: LLaSO建立基础开放标准，统一研究力量，加速社区驱动的LSLMs进展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

*Yingshu Li,Yunyi Liu,Lingqiao Liu,Lei Wang,Luping Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出名为RadReason的放射学报告评估框架，在ReXVal基准测试中表现出色，代码将发布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告评估方法缺乏临床依据、可解释性和细粒度，无法满足实际临床工作需求。

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization，采用子分数动态加权和多数引导优势缩放两项创新技术。

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中超越之前的离线指标，与基于GPT - 4的评估相当。

Conclusion: RadReason可解释、成本效益高，适合临床部署。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑大语言模型在处理有主观行为和偏好用户时的效果，提出三个关于语言模型的问题。

Method: 引入适用于主观行为的集群式语言模型训练方法HeTLM。

Result: 使用页面级分词器训练的小语言模型优于大的预训练或微调语言模型；HeTLM优于同家族单语言模型；生成结果均值更高、方差更低。

Conclusion: HeTLM能更好地处理用户的主观行为和偏好，提升语言模型与用户的对齐效果。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出轻量级模型CUPE，能在120毫秒内捕捉关键音素特征，通过学习通用声学模式实现有竞争力的跨语言性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多语音处理任务需要不受上下文影响的纯音素表示，因此开发CUPE模型。

Method: CUPE独立处理短的固定宽度窗口，通过在多种语言上进行有监督和自监督训练学习通用声学模式。

Result: 在多种语言上的评估，包括UCLA语音语料库的零样本测试，显示出强跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过对音素长度窗口内的基本声学模式建模，有效的通用语音处理是可行的。

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

TL;DR: 研究扩大语言模型词汇表大小的影响，发现扩大词汇表可降低文本复杂度、主要降低高频词损失，为分词器 - 模型协同设计提供依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩大词汇表做法益处来源不明，需研究其作用机制。

Method: 在固定数据、计算和优化条件下，将语言模型词汇表从24K扩展到196K，量化文本复杂度，进行词级损失分解等。

Result: 扩大词汇表降低文本复杂度，主要降低2500个高频词的交叉熵损失，虽稀有词损失上升，但优势能转移到下游基准；固定词汇表增加模型参数也有高频词优势。

Conclusion: 将“更大词汇表有帮助”重新表述为“降低分词文本复杂度有帮助”，为分词器 - 模型协同设计提供简单原则，明确预训练中语言模型扩展的损失动态。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Method: 引入EcomMMMU数据集，基于其分析结果提出数据驱动的SUMEI方法，通过预测视觉效用策略性利用多图。

Result: 分析显示产品图片不总能提升性能，综合实验证明SUMEI方法有效且稳健。

Conclusion: MLLMs在电商任务中难以有效利用丰富视觉内容，SUMEI方法可策略性利用多图。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习在预训练语言模型中成效有限，探究用更贴合模型训练中示例难度的指标替代传统指标能否使课程学习更具竞争力。

Method: 用训练数据影响分数对训练示例排序，该分数估计单个训练示例对模型输出的影响。

Result: 在基准测试中，使用新课程训练的模型比随机顺序训练的模型性能高出超10个百分点。

Conclusion: 只要采用以模型为中心的难度概念，课程学习对语言模型预训练是有益的。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Motivation: 解决医学大语言模型在诊断中存在知识缺口和幻觉问题，以及现有检索和工具增强方法对外部知识利用弱和反馈推理可追溯性差的问题。

Method: 构建大规模医疗检索语料库，将大语言模型作为核心代理、检索语料库作为环境，用定制奖励通过强化学习从大规模数据中演化代理式RAG策略。

Conclusion: Deep - DxSearch方法独特有效，能为临床医生提供更可靠精确的初步诊断。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Motivation: 现有LLM在精确计算任务表现不佳，TIR虽出现但泛化性及对模型推理行为的影响待研究。

Method: 引入ReasonZoo基准评估TIR在多领域的有效性，提出PAC和AUC - PCC指标评估推理效率。

Result: TIR模型在数学和非数学任务上均优于非TIR模型，PAC和AUC - PCC改善，推理效率提升。

Conclusion: TIR有领域通用优势，能提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 方法的扩展局限。

Method: 提出基于Flow Matching的机器学习框架，利用CNN架构，学习连续的、温度条件映射。

Result: 在2D XY模型中，小网络训练后能为大系统生成可靠样本，生成配置与关键热力学观测值吻合，捕捉到BKT转变特征。

Conclusion: 该“小训练大生成”能力为研究临界现象建立新范式，有计算优势，可用于其他晶格上连续场描述的系统。

Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome
the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We
demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained
only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse
temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger
system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without
retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key
thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is
enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous,
temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the
underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are
scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a
new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a
significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The
method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems
described by continuous fields on a lattice.

Conclusion: 物理系统能以多种不同方式进行鲁棒信息存储，多体记忆的物理性质比以往认知更丰富。

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local
non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary
perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.
Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.
