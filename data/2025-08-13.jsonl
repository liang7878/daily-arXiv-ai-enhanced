This work aims to increase the representativeness of the\nvolume element by attenuating the mesh and size sensitivities in representative\nvolume element (RVE) modelling. A technique to alleviate mesh sensitivity in\nRVE modelling is proposed, which equalises the fracture energy observed from\ncomputational analysis with the real phenomenon, thereby keeping the response\nindependent of the bandwidth of strain localisation. Based on the hypothesis\nthat ensuring periodicity of strain, in addition to displacement periodicity\nacross the domain boundary and supplementing the capability of periodic\nboundary conditions (PBCs) to attenuate the size dependency in RVE modelling, a\nset of modified PBCs (MPBCs) are formulated. One thousand two hundred RVE\nsamples falling into combinations of five fibre volume fractions and four RVE\nsizes are analysed under transverse loading, and the ability of MPBCs to\nattenuate the effect of RVE size on the precision of material response,\nparticularly in the inelastic regime, is verified. This work also focuses on\nvarious factors affecting damage initiation in 2D composite RVEs. The\narrangement of a pair of fibres with their members placed close to each other,\nsuch that the angle between the direction of loading and an imaginary line\ndrawn between their centres is less, is observed to make the region between\nthem more favourable to damage."}

However, despite the widespread use of RDBs\nacross various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders\ntheir ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous\nresearch has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among\nmultiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key\nrelationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or\nconstructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations\namong different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for\npredictive modeling unexplored.

By introducing a new retrieval mechanism\ninto RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite\ndependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive\nfield of tabular data prediction.

Moreover, when decoding multiple codewords in parallel, our\nderandomization load-balances the queries per-node, thereby preventing\ncongestion and maintaining a low round complexity.\n  Deterministic decoding of LDCs presents a new challenge: the adversary can\ntarget precisely the (few) nodes that are queried for decoding a certain\ncodeword. We overcome this issue via an adaptive doubling strategy: if a\ndecoding attempt for a codeword fails, the node doubles the number of its\ndecoding attempts. Similarly, when the adversary crashes the decoding node\nitself, we replace it dynamically with two other non-crashed nodes. By\ncarefully combining these two doubling processes, we overcome the challenges\nposed by the combination of a deterministic LDC with a worst case pattern of\ncrashes."}

However, too many tokens\ngenerated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,\nessentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due\nto limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the\nlatency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt\nlength. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long\noccupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to\nseparate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud\nhelps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.\nSpecifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with\nits own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.\nThen, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for\nsmoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the\nprogress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the\nresource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the\nprompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to\nfurther speed up on-device inference.

Statement units can model\nmeasurements, observations, or universal relationships, including causal ones,\nand link to methods and evidence. Compound units group related statement units\ninto reusable, semantically coherent knowledge objects.

Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use\nLow-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With\nthis, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly\nadapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison\nto zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,\nsmall LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger\nGPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune\nsmaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.\nDespite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show\nthat solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can\nenable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future."}

Such\n2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a\nneural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change\nover time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory\nstorage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or\nprogrammed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained\n(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical\nfoundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections\nto transformers and state space models.

Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data\nfiltering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque\nblack box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses\ntechniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively\nmitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves\ntwo primary stages. First, we train linear \"probes\" on the internal activations\nof a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,\ngender, race, age). Our experiments on \\texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that\nthese probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing\nthat bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.\nSecond, we leverage these findings to compute \"steering vectors\" by contrasting\nthe model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding\nthese vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative\nprocess away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in\nreal-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,\nshowing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral\nalternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that\noffers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more\naccountable LLMs."}

However, despite the widespread use of RDBs\nacross various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders\ntheir ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous\nresearch has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among\nmultiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key\nrelationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or\nconstructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations\namong different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for\npredictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified\npredictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary\ndependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,\nand propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns\nfor prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism\ninto RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite\ndependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive\nfield of tabular data prediction.

However, the domain of game-playing poses\na particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large\nstate space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of\nthe policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal\npatterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more\ntrainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.\nAny increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as\nincreasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with\nconvergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a\nmeaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state\ninto a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this\nmatrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the\nhighest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE\nwith CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input\nstate, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple\nreinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result\nthrough reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a\nbilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by\nthe CMA-ES algorithm."}

We\nquantify the prevalence of hallucinations in recent language models and explore\na range of metric-based approaches to automatically detect them. Our findings\nreveal that approximately 50\\% of generated code reviews and 20\\% of generated\ncommit messages contain hallucinations. Whilst commonly used metrics are weak\ndetectors on their own, combining multiple metrics substantially improves\nperformance. Notably, model confidence and feature attribution metrics\neffectively contribute to hallucination detection, showing promise for\ninference-time detection.\\footnote{All code and data will be released upon\nacceptance."}

However, too many tokens\ngenerated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,\nessentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due\nto limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the\nlatency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt\nlength. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long\noccupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to\nseparate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud\nhelps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.\nSpecifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with\nits own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.\nThen, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for\nsmoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the\nprogress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the\nresource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the\nprompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to\nfurther speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,\nand confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an\nalgorithm to decide the best settings.

We further curate a collection of\ncomplex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark\ncomprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the\ninstructions in LogicIFEval.

Benchmarking LLM Performance on Privacy and AI Governance Exams", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) has raised urgent\nquestions across the modern workforce about this new technology's strengths,\nweaknesses, and capabilities. For privacy professionals, the question is\nwhether these AI systems can provide reliable support on regulatory compliance,\nprivacy program management, and AI governance. In this study, we evaluate ten\nleading open and closed LLMs, including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google\nDeepMind, Meta, and DeepSeek, by benchmarking their performance on\nindustry-standard certification exams: CIPP/US, CIPM, CIPT, and AIGP from the\nInternational Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). Each model was\ntested using official sample exams in a closed-book setting and compared to\nIAPP's passing thresholds. Our findings show that several frontier models such\nas Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5 consistently achieve scores exceeding the\nstandards for professional human certification - demonstrating substantial\nexpertise in privacy law, technical controls, and AI governance. The results\nhighlight both the strengths and domain-specific gaps of current LLMs and offer\npractical insights for privacy officers, compliance leads, and technologists\nassessing the readiness of AI tools for high-stakes data governance roles. This\npaper provides an overview for professionals navigating the intersection of AI\nadvancement and regulatory risk and establishes a machine benchmark based on\nhuman-centric evaluations."}

Conventional outdoor monitoring\nrelies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive\ndata training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.\nMultimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,\nutilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models\nfor enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based\noutdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data\ncontains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation\nnoise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor\nenvironments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer\nbased MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design\nfor fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder\naccurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat\nthese challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,\nnamed DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy\nenvironments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify\nmodality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and\ntemporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with\nlow-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based\non quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from\nfluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common\nsemantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness."}

Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption\npreferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy,\nmainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and\ndiscovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive\nRetrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the\nframework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to\nconstruct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the\nRQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining\nbehavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve\ndynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the\nprobability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.\nThis facilitates an efficient \"soft-search\" strategy during online inference,\nrevolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from \"passive matching\" to \"proactive\nexploration\" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B\ntests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have\nachieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view\nduration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in\nPV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are\nconducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and\nNormalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent\nimprovement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and\npractical value of the proposed method."}

We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant\nReasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and\nprediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a\npermutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module\nthat incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and\nin-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This\narchitecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and\nsupport examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions\nfor any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference\ntasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results\nacross diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature\nacquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under\ntest-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These\ncapabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware\ninference over structured data."}

In this work, we present\nColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention\nmechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By\ndisentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention\nmaps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color\nediting, along with word-level control of attribute intensity.

Our work here reveals a critical\nphenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the\nmiddle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative\nTSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the\nCountdown dataset over an existing dLLM.
