To address this, we introduce a conceptual\nframework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to\nflexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a\nsimple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse\nsynthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this\ncapability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment\nshow that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more\nsample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by\nhuman-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities.

In this paper, we prove\nthat for synchronous robots moving on finite graphs, the unlimited\ncomputational power (other than finite time) has a significant impact. In fact,\nby exploiting it, we provide a definitive resolution algorithm that applies to\na wide class of problems while guaranteeing the minimum number of moves and\nrounds."}

We\nconducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify the\ninteractions, comparing interactions among code smells and interactions between\ncode smells and non-code smells. Our results suggest that while interactions\nbetween code smell pairs are associated with increases in certain dependencies\nand decreases in others, overall, they are associated with an increase in total\ndependencies. For example, the median number of dependencies between Feature\nEnvy methods and Data Classes is seven times as many as when the methods are\nnon-Feature Envy methods, increasing from 1 to 7.

An\nLLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,\nachieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul\nas the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further\ncarry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that\nvulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and\nexhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that\nmulti-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to\nvulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark\nreveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools\nand the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python\npackages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs\nobserved in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of\ncurrent detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in\nthe field."}

Treatment and control groups, each comprising\n345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling\nTechnique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation\nstrategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an\noutput layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and\nspecificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the\nROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation\ncoefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,\nrespectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD.

We derive a\nUnified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide\nspectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective\nunder different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance\ntradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable\nparts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,\nand likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose\nHybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different\ntraining signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of\ndemonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning\npatterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the\neffectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT\nconsistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and\nfamilies."}

The key\nchallenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent\nsegments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.\nTo address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures\nsmoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the\nanchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's\nwholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with\nboth local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,\nmaking it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation."}

Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed,\ntheir effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the\ndomain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human\nspeech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately\naddressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges\nwith diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To\nfill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale,\nhighly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust\ndevelopment of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of\nover 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10\nvocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio\nclips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive\nexperiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods\ntrained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio\nsamples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice,\nunderscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods\ntrained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and\nsignificantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error\nrate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild\ndataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.\nAUDETER is available on GitHub."}

To address these issues, we propose\nPhoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation\n(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity\ndisambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.\nThese components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity\nretrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty.

To address\nkey limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting\nmulti-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a\nnovel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means\nclustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and\nintegrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes\n(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted\nparking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates\nmasking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal\nrepresentation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention\nmechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via\npatching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions\nthrough inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from\nChengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep\nlearning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and\niTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean\nsquared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive\nablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different\ndata sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance\ngains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)\ncontribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that\nexcluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to\nsubstantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling\nspatial dependencies."}

While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto\n3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and\ntransfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.\nAdditionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and\nseparation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or\nobjects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\n3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from\npretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,\nwe leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.\nThen, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This\nprocess incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style\nalignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of\nthe UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures\nthat the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style\nfidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style\ntransfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across\nstylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in\na more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D\nstyle transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree\nenvironments.

We\npropose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves\ninformation in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA\nwith algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient\nprojector pretraining with negligible inference overhead.

Simulated AI\nbias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in\nreal-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,\nHispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups\non quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their\nunconscious associations between race and status using implicit association\ntests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been\ninvestigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or\nwith AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates\nat equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,\npeople also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a\nsignificant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose\nidentities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%\nif people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if\npeople think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their\ndecisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances.
