Tangma was evaluated on MNIST and\nCIFAR-10 using custom networks composed of convolutional and linear layers, and\ncompared against ReLU, Swish, and GELU. On MNIST, Tangma achieved the highest\nvalidation accuracy of 99.09% and the lowest validation loss, demonstrating\nfaster and more stable convergence than the baselines. On CIFAR-10, Tangma\nreached a top validation accuracy of 78.15%, outperforming all other activation\nfunctions while maintaining a competitive training loss. Tangma also showed\nimproved training efficiency, with lower average epoch runtimes compared to\nSwish and GELU. These results suggest that Tangma performs well on standard\nvision tasks and enables reliable, efficient training. Its learnable design\ngives more control over activation behavior, which may benefit larger models in\ntasks such as image recognition or language modeling."}

While large language models (LLMs) show significant\npotential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and\npowerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the\ngranularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to\noverly fine or coarse interest grouping.

However,\nthis approach presents a fundamental trade-off in threshold parameter\nselection. While large $\\theta$ values introduce substantial noise in the\nreleased degree sequence, small $\\theta$ values result in more edges removed\nthan necessary. Furthermore, $\\theta$ selection leads to an excessive\ncommunication cost. To remedy existing solutions' deficiencies, we present\nCADR-LDP, an efficient framework incorporating encryption techniques and\ndifferentially private mechanisms to release the degree sequence. In CADR-LDP,\nwe first use the crypto-assisted Optimal-$\\theta$-Selection method to select\nthe optimal parameter with a low communication cost. Then, we use the LPEA-LOW\nmethod to add some edges for each node with the edge addition process in local\nprojection. LPEA-LOW prioritizes the projection with low-degree nodes, which\ncan retain more edges for such nodes and reduce the projection error.\nTheoretical analysis shows that CADR-LDP satisfies $\\epsilon$-node local\ndifferential privacy.

We develop a retirement funding policy in two\nsteps. In the first step, we consider a simplified planning problem in which\nvarious future quantities, such as the retiree's remaining lifetime, future\ninvestment returns, and future inflation, are known. Using a simplified model\nof taxes, we pose this planning problem as a convex optimization problem, where\nwe maximize the bequest subject to providing a constant inflation adjusted\nconsumption target. Since this problem is convex, it can be solved quickly and\nreliably. We leverage this planning method to form a retirement funding policy\nthat determines the actions to take each year, based on information known at\nthat time. Each year the retiree forms a new plan for the future years, using\nthe current account values and life expectancy, and optionally, updated\ninformation such as changes in tax rates or rules. The retiree then carries out\nthe actions from the first year of the current plan. This update-plan-act cycle\nis repeated each year, a general policy called model predictive control (MPC).\nThe MPC retirement policy reacts to the effects of uncertain investment returns\nand inflation, changes in the retiree's expected lifetime or external income\nand liabilities, and changes in tax rules and rates.

The corpus comprises MIDI files and data sheets of\nDastgah Shour from Radif Mirza Abdollah, the foundational repertoire of Iranian\nclassical music. Furthermore, we apply our previously-introduced algorithm for\nparsing melodic structure (Kanani et al., 2023b)to the dataset. Unlike much\nWestern music, this type of non-metric music does not follow bar-centric\norganisation. The non-metric organisation can be captured well by our parsing\nalgorithm. We parse each tune (Gusheh) into a grammar to identify motifs and\nphrases. These grammar representations can be useful for educational and\nethnomusicological purposes. We also further develop a previously-introduced\nmethod of creating melodic variations (Kanani et al., 2023b). After parsing an\nexisting tune to produce a grammar, by applying mutations to this grammar, we\ngenerate a new grammar. Expanding this new version yields a variation of the\noriginal tune. Variations are assessed by a domain-expert listener.\nAdditionally, we conduct a statistical analysis of mutation with different\nrepresentation setups for our parsing and generation algorithms. The\noverarching conclusion is that the system successfully produces acceptable\nvariations post-mutation. While our case study focuses on Iranian classical\nmusic, the methodology can be adapted for Arabic or Turkish classical music."}

A Perspective from Data Dimensionality Reduction", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "comment": "Accepted by ICML2025 as a poster", "summary": "In recent years, contrastive learning has achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance in the territory of self-supervised representation learning. Many\nprevious works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding\nunderlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a\ndefault assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold\nin practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the\nstrength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random\nresized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling\nerror on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We\nfirst reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on\ndownstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality\nreduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on\noriginal data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical\nand empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a\ndouble-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream\nclassification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation\ngraph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion\nthat we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in\nour experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large\ngraph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance."}

However, existing detection methods for data poisoning attacks on\nDL-based code search models remain insufficiently effective. To address this\ncritical security issue, we propose MT4DP, a Data Poisoning Attack Detection\nFramework for DL-based Code Search Models via Metamorphic Testing. MT4DP\nintroduces a novel Semantically Equivalent Metamorphic Relation (SE-MR)\ndesigned to detect data poisoning attacks on DL-based code search models.\nSpecifically, MT4DP first identifies the high-frequency words from search\nqueries as potential poisoning targets and takes their corresponding queries as\nthe source queries. For each source query, MT4DP generates two semantically\nequivalent follow-up queries and retrieves its source ranking list. Then, each\nsource ranking list is re-ranked based on the semantic similarities between its\ncode snippets and the follow-up queries. Finally, variances between the source\nand re-ranked lists are calculated to reveal violations of the SE-MR and warn\nthe data poisoning attack.

To address this, our ExRec presents\nan end-to-end pipeline, from annotating the KCs of questions and learning their\nsemantic representations to training KT models and optimizing several\nreinforcement learning (RL) methods. Moreover, we improve standard\nQ-learning-based continuous RL methods via a tailored model-based value\nestimation (MVE) approach that directly leverages the components of KT model in\nestimating cumulative knowledge improvement. We validate the effectiveness of\nour ExRec using various RL methods across four real-world tasks with different\neducational goals in online math learning. We further show that ExRec\ngeneralizes robustly to new, unseen questions and that it produces\ninterpretable student learning trajectories. Together, our findings highlight\nthe promise of KT-guided RL for effective personalization in education."}

To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning.

We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with\nperformance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to\noverrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.\n  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple\nsampling strategies.

Traditionally, data from IoT devices is\ncentralized for analysis, but this approach introduces delays and increased\ncommunication costs. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective\nalternative, allowing for model training across distributed devices without the\nneed to centralize data. In many applications, such as smart home energy and\nenvironmental monitoring, the data collected by IoT devices across different\nlocations can exhibit significant variation in trends and seasonal patterns.\nAccurately forecasting such non-stationary, non-linear time-series data is\ncrucial for applications like energy consumption estimation and weather\nforecasting. However, these data variations can severely impact prediction\naccuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how\nnon-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized\nextreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance.\n(2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series\ndata influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated\nseveral synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and\ntrained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL\napproaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world\ndatasets with non-linear time-series data distributions. Our experimental\nresults show that: (1) FL performs worse than centralized approaches when\ndealing with non-linear data distributions.

While many\nexisting methods utilize density ratio-based measures, such as the\n$f$-divergence, for regularization, we propose an approach that utilizes the\nWasserstein distance, which is robust to out-of-distribution data and captures\nthe similarity between actions. Our method employs input-convex neural networks\n(ICNNs) to model optimal transport maps, enabling the computation of the\nWasserstein distance in a discriminator-free manner, thereby avoiding\nadversarial training and ensuring stable learning. Our approach demonstrates\ncomparable or superior performance to widely used existing methods on the D4RL\nbenchmark dataset. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/motokiomura/Q-DOT ."}

In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best\nmethod, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and\n4.11% in recall.\n  We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy,\nimbalanced, and large-scale datasets.

However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a\nsimplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural\nrepresentations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin\nto those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information\nredundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive\nperformance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight\narchitectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information\nprocessing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled\nby kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order\nspatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further\nmodulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise\nredundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently\ngather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental\nresults in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable\nparameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,\non the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M\nparameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver\nstrong performance through an efficient design.

Many\nprevious works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding\nunderlying the success of contrastive learning.

Focusing on these\nlatent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support\nfor psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese\nparent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on\nideal parent bias and suppressed emotion.

In this paper, we propose\nleveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs,\ne.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we\nextract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review\nreports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper,\nwhich are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a\ntext-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human\nand LLM knowledge.

However, current\nsystolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing\nFlashAttention. Systolic arrays can only achieve high utilization for\nconsecutive and large matrix multiplications. In contrast, FlashAttention\nrequires frequently interleaved matrix multiplications and softmax operations.\n  The frequent data swaps between the systolic array and external vector units\nresult in low systolic array utilization. This is further exacerbated by the\nfact that softmax involves numerous non-matrix operations, which are not\nwell-suited for systolic arrays. Moreover, the concurrent execution of matrix\nmultiplication on systolic arrays and softmax on vector units leads to register\nfile and SRAM port contention, further degrading performance.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array\narchitecture that enables the entire FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely\nwithin a single systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units.\nAt the core of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps\nFlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise\noverlap. This significantly improves array utilization while preserving the\noriginal floating-point operation order to maintain numerical stability.\n  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against\nstate-of-the-art commercial accelerators.
