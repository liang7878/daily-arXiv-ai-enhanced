Unfortunately, traditional approaches such as fair sharing do not provide performance isolation for storage systems, because their resources (e.g., write buffers and read caches) exhibit high preemption delays. These delays lead to unacceptable spikes in client tail latencies, as clients may be forced to wait arbitrarily long to receive their fair share of resources.\n  We introduce Delta Fair Sharing, a family of algorithms for sharing resources with high preemption delays. These algorithms satisfy two key properties: $\u03b4$-fairness, which bounds a client's delay in receiving its fair share of resources to $\u03b4$ time units, and $\u03b4$-Pareto-efficiency, which allocates unused resources to clients with unmet demand. Together, these properties capture resource-acquisition delays end-to-end, bound well-behaved clients' tail-latency spikes to $\u03b4$ time units, and ensure high utilization. We implement such algorithms in FAIRDB, an extension of RocksDB.

Column names and descriptions are valuable for this task. LLMs can leverage such natural-language schema metadata. However, in many datasets, correct matching requires additional evidence beyond the column itself. Because it is impractical to provide an LLM with the entire schema metadata needed to capture this evidence, the core challenge becomes to select and organize the most useful contextual information.\n  We present ConStruM, a structure-guided framework for budgeted evidence packing in schema matching. ConStruM constructs a lightweight, reusable structure in which, at query time, it assembles a small context pack emphasizing the most discriminative evidence. ConStruM is designed as an add-on: given a shortlist of candidate targets produced by an upstream matcher, it augments the matcher's final LLM prompt with structured, query-specific evidence so that the final selection is better grounded. For this purpose, we develop a context tree for budgeted multi-level context retrieval and a global similarity hypergraph that surfaces groups of highly similar columns (on both the source and target sides), summarized via group-aware differentiation cues computed online or precomputed offline.

Specifically, they achieve high accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs by re-training complex models from scratch or solving NP-hard selection problems in every iteration. In this paper, we propose ALER, a novel, semi-supervised pipeline designed to bridge the gap between semantic accuracy and computational scalability. ALER eliminates the training bottleneck by using a frozen bi-encoder architecture to generate static embeddings once and then iteratively training a lightweight classifier on top. To address the memory bottleneck associated with large-scale candidate pools, we first select a representative sample of the data and then use K-Means to partition this sample into semantically coherent chunks, enabling an efficient AL loop. We further propose a hybrid query strategy that combines \"confused\" and \"confident\" pairs to efficiently refine the decision boundary while correcting high-confidence errors.Extensive evaluation demonstrates ALER's superior efficiency, particularly on the large-scale DBLP dataset: it accelerates the training loop by 1.3x while drastically reducing resolution latency by a factor of 3.8 compared to the fastest baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7ba1\u9053ALER\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u4e2d\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u751f\u6210\u9759\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u9009\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u7528K - Means\u5206\u533a\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21DBLP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u52a0\u901f1.3\u500d\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e3.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ALER\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002"}}

We show that by retraining the neural network using a physics-informed hardware-aware model one can fully recover the inference accuracy of the ideal network model even in the presence of significant non-idealities. This is way more promising for scalability and integration density than the default option of improving the fidelity of the analog neural network at the cost of significant energy, area, and design overhead, through extensive calibration and conservative analog design.\n  We first present a physics-informed hardware-aware model for a time-domain vector-matrix multiplier implemented with single-transistor floating-gate memory cells that explicitly accounts for two dominant non-idealities of the physical implementation - capacitive crosstalk and bit-line voltage drop - and integrates seamlessly with modern deep-learning workflows. The model discretizes each operation into adaptive time slots, processes activation patterns in parallel, and accumulates their contributions to predict effective multiplier outputs. Using measurements from a 16x16 silicon array, we calibrate the model, show that crosstalk is layout-dependent and often dominant, and introduce an improved weight-extraction procedure that doubles signal-to-error ratio versus an ideal vector-matrix multiplier model. Finally, we show that by training silicon-based analog neural networks using an hardware-aware model in the forward pass we can recover the accuracy of the ideal software networks across three architectures -- custom MLP on low-resolution MNIST, LeNet-5 on MNIST, and a VGG-style CNN on CIFAR-10 - establishing a complete design-to-deployment workflow for time-domain analog neuromorphic chips.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7845\u57fa\u6a21\u62df\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6709\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u4ece\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5230\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7845\u57fa\u6a21\u62df\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4fdd\u5b88\u6a21\u62df\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u5177\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u64cd\u4f5c\u79bb\u6563\u5230\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u9699\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u752816x16\u7845\u9635\u5217\u6d4b\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u6743\u91cd\u63d0\u53d6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u8868\u660e\u4e32\u6270\u4e0e\u5e03\u5c40\u6709\u5173\u4e14\u5e38\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u63d0\u53d6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f7f\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u7406\u60f3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65f6\u57df\u6a21\u62df\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u82af\u7247\u4ece\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5230\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

A \\emph{rebalancing} transfers assets directly from one CFMM's pool to another's, bypassing the CFMMs' standard trading protocols. In any \\emph{arbitrage-prone} configuration, we prove there exists a rebalancing to an \\textit{arbitrage-free} configuration that strictly increases some CFMMs' liquidities without reducing the liquidities of the others. Moreover, we prove that a configuration is arbitrage-free if and only if it is \\emph{Pareto efficient} under rebalancing, meaning that any further direct asset transfers must decrease some CFMM's liquidity. We prove that for any log-concave trading function, including the ubiquitous constant product market maker, the search for an optimal, arbitrage-free rebalancing that maximizes global liquidity while ensuring no participant is worse off can be cast as a convex optimization problem with a unique, computationally tractable solution. We extend this framework to \\emph{mixed rebalancing}, where a subset of participating CFMMs use a combination of direct transfers and standard trades to transition to an arbitrage-free configuration while harvesting arbitrage profits from non-participating CFMMs, and from price oracle market makers such as centralized exchanges.

While the classical Sieve of Eratosthenes is simple and efficient in theory, its practical performance on modern central processing units is often limited by memory access inefficiencies. This paper introduces a cache-aware hybrid sieve that integrates segmentation, bit-packing, and cache-line-aligned block processing to optimize memory bandwidth and level one and level two cache locality.\n  The proposed approach reduces memory usage by storing only odd numbers and using one bit per value. The sieve range is divided into cache-sized blocks to minimize cache misses, while primes up to the square root of the limit are reused across blocks. Experimental results demonstrate up to an eight times reduction in memory usage and runtime improvements of up to two point four times compared to the classical sieve and one point seven times compared to the segmented sieve.

Code available at https://github.com/studiofarzulla/tensor-defi", "summary": "Cryptocurrency projects articulate value propositions through whitepapers, making claims about functionality and technical capabilities. This study investigates whether these narratives align with observed market behavior. We construct a pipeline combining zero-shot NLP classification (BART-MNLI) with CP tensor decomposition to compare three spaces: (1) a claims matrix from 24 whitepapers across 10 semantic categories, (2) market statistics for 49 assets over two years of hourly data, and (3) latent factors from tensor decomposition (rank 2, 92.45% variance explained). Using Procrustes rotation and Tucker's congruence coefficient, we test alignment across 23 common entities.\n  Results show weak alignment: claims-statistics (phi=0.341, p=0.332), claims-factors (phi=0.077, p=0.747), and statistics-factors (phi=0.197, p<0.001). The statistics-factors significance validates our methodology, confirming the pipeline detects relationships when present. Inter-model validation with DeBERTa-v3 yields 32% exact agreement but 67% top-3 agreement. Cross-sectional analysis reveals heterogeneous contributions: NEAR, MKR, ATOM show positive alignment while ENS, UNI, Bitcoin diverge most.

Error-bounded lossy compression has emerged as a critical solution for mitigating these challenges, providing a means to reduce data size while ensuring that reconstructed data remains valid for scientific analysis. In this paper, we present a data-driven scientific data compressor, called Discontinuous Data-informed Local Subspaces (Discontinuous DLS), to improve compression-to-error ratios over data-agnostic compressors. This error-bounded compressor leverages localized spatial and temporal subspaces, informed by the underlying data structure, to enhance compression efficiency and preserve key features. The presented technique is flexible and applicable to a wide range of scientific data, including fluid dynamics, environmental simulations, and other high-dimensional, time-dependent datasets. We describe the core principles of the method and demonstrate its ability to significantly reduce storage requirements without compromising critical data fidelity. The technique is implemented in a distributed computing environment using MPI, and its performance is evaluated against state-of-the-art error-bounded compression methods in terms of compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

However, it consistently struggles with estimation errors in expected returns and the covariance matrix, its core parameters. To address this concern, this research evaluates the performance of mean variance (MV) and global minimum-variance (GMV) models across various shrinkage estimators designed to improve these parameters. Specifically, we examine five shrinkage estimators for expected returns and eleven for the covariance matrix. To compare multiple portfolios, we employ a super efficient data envelopment analysis model to rank the portfolios according to investors risk-return preferences. Our comprehensive empirical investigation utilizes six real world datasets with different dimensional characteristics, applying a rolling window methodology across three out of sample testing periods. Following the ranking process, we examine the chosen shrinkage based MV or GMV portfolios against five traditional portfolio optimization techniques classical MV and GMV for sample estimates, MiniMax, conditional value at risk, and semi mean absolute deviation risk measures. Our empirical findings reveal that, in most scenarios, the GMV model combined with the Ledoit Wolf two parameter shrinkage covariance estimator (COV2) represents the optimal selection for a broad spectrum of investors.

This shift does not stem from the creation of more persuasive or ideologically extreme original content using ChatGPT. Instead, it originates from the tendency of ChatGPT-generated comments to echo and reinforce the viewpoint of original posts, a pattern consistent with algorithmic sycophancy.

Existing state-of-the-art methods typically rely on token likelihoods, yet they often overlook the divergence from the model's top-1 prediction and local correlation between adjacent tokens. In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations. Extensive experiments on the WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks demonstrate that Gap-K% achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming prior baselines across various model sizes and input lengths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGap - K%\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u7248\u6743\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u51faGap - K%\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528top - 1\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u76ee\u6807token\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728WikiMIA\u548cMIMIR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGap - K%\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "Gap - K%\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Architecturally, DNNs rely on the recursive application of parametrized functions, a mechanism that can be unstable and difficult to train, making stability a primary concern. Even when training succeeds, there are few rigorous results on how well such models generalize beyond the observed data, especially in the generative setting. In this work, we leverage the theory of stochastic Iterated Function Systems (IFS) and show that two important deep architectures can be viewed as, or canonically associated with, place-dependent IFS. This connection allows us to import results from random dynamical systems to (i) establish the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures under suitable contractivity assumptions, and (ii) derive a Wasserstein generalization bound for generative modeling. The bound naturally leads to a new training objective that directly controls the collage-type approximation error between the data distribution and its image under the learned transfer operator.

Unlike most existing methods that implicitly assume a stationary data-generating process, in practise, mortgage portfolios are exposed to various forms of data drift caused by changing borrower behaviour, macroeconomic conditions, policy regimes and so on. This study investigates the impact of data drift on survival-based credit risk models and proposes a dynamic joint modelling framework to improve robustness under non-stationary environments.

Understanding how queries and documents semantically interact is critical for diagnosing retrieval behavior and improving model design. However, existing dense retrievers rely on static embeddings for both queries and documents, which obscures this bidirectional relationship. Post-hoc approaches such as re-rankers are computationally expensive, add inference latency, and still fail to reveal the underlying semantic alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Interpretable Modular Retrieval Neural Networks (IMRNNs), a lightweight framework that augments any dense retriever with dynamic, bidirectional modulation at inference time. IMRNNs employ two independent adapters: one conditions document embeddings on the current query, while the other refines the query embedding using corpus-level feedback from initially retrieved documents. This iterative modulation process enables the model to adapt representations dynamically and expose interpretable semantic dependencies between queries and documents. Empirically, IMRNNs not only enhance interpretability but also improve retrieval effectiveness. Across seven benchmark datasets, applying our method to standard dense retrievers yields average gains of +6.35% nDCG, +7.14% recall, and +7.04% MRR over state-of-the-art baselines.

Our empirical analysis reveals a counterintuitive flaw in this paradigm: while promotion rescues low-to-medium quality content, it can harm high-quality content by forcing exposure to suboptimal audiences, polluting engagement signals and downgrading future recommendation. We recast content promotion as a dual-objective optimization that balances short-term value acquisition with long-term model improvement. To make this tractable at bid time in content promotion, we introduce a decomposable surrogate objective, gradient coverage, and establish its formal connection to Fisher Information and optimal experimental design. We design a two-stage auto-bidding algorithm based on Lagrange duality that dynamically paces budget through a shadow price and optimizes impression-level bids using per-impression marginal utilities. To address missing labels at bid time, we propose a confidence-gated gradient heuristic, paired with a zeroth-order variant for black-box models that reliably estimates learning signals in real time. We provide theoretical guarantees, proving monotone submodularity of the composite objective, sublinear regret in online auction, and budget feasibility. Extensive offline experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the framework: it outperforms baselines, achieves superior final AUC/LogLoss, adheres closely to budget targets, and remains effective when gradients are approximated zeroth-order.

As demand for higher-resolution images and longer videos increases, single-GPU inference becomes inefficient due to increased latency and large activation sizes. Current frameworks employ sequence parallelism (SP) techniques such as Ulysses Attention and Ring Attention to scale inference. However, these implementations have three primary limitations: (1) suboptimal communication patterns for network topologies on modern GPU machines, (2) latency bottlenecks from all-to-all operations in inter-machine communication, and (3) GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads from using two-sided communication libraries. To address these issues, we present StreamFusion, a topology-aware efficient DiT serving engine. StreamFusion incorporates three key innovations: (1) a topology-aware sequence parallelism technique that accounts for inter- and intra-machine bandwidth differences, (2) Torus Attention, a novel SP technique enabling overlapping of inter-machine all-to-all operations with computation, and (3) a one-sided communication implementation that minimizes GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads.

Currently, GAI shows limited capability in the specialized domains due to data scarcity. In this paper, we develop a continuum mechanics-based theoretical framework to generalize the optimal transport theory from pure mathematics, which can be used to describe the dynamics of data, realizing the generative tasks with a small amount of data. The developed theory is used to solve three typical problem involved in many mechanical designs and engineering applications: at material level, how to generate the stress-strain response outside the range of experimental conditions based on experimentally measured stress-strain data; at structure level, how to generate the temperature-dependent stress fields under the thermal loading; at system level, how to generate the plastic strain fields under transient dynamic loading.

Applying natural language processing to historical newspapers, we identify 4,049 runs on individual banks. Runs are considerably more likely in weak banks but also occur in strong banks, especially in response to negative news about the real economy or the broader banking system. However, runs typically only result in failure for banks with weak fundamentals. Strong banks survive runs through various mechanisms, including interbank cooperation, equity injections, public signals of strength, and suspension of convertibility. At the local level, bank failures (with and without runs) translate into substantially larger declines in deposits and lending than runs without failures. Our findings suggest that poor bank fundamentals are necessary for bank runs to translate into failure and for bank distress to generate severe economic consequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u75281863 - 1934\u5e74\u7f8e\u56fd\u94f6\u884c\u6324\u5151\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7814\u7a76\u6324\u5151\u539f\u56e0\u4e0e\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f31\u94f6\u884c\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u6324\u5151\uff0c\u5f3a\u94f6\u884c\u9047\u8d1f\u9762\u6d88\u606f\u4e5f\u4f1a\u6709\u6324\u5151\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f31\u94f6\u884c\u6324\u5151\u6613\u81f4\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u94f6\u884c\u5012\u95ed\u6bd4\u672a\u5012\u95ed\u6324\u5151\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u94f6\u884c\u6324\u5151\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u540e\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u62a5\u7eb8\u5e94\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b4049\u8d77\u94f6\u884c\u6324\u5151\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5f31\u94f6\u884c\u66f4\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u6324\u5151\uff0c\u5f3a\u94f6\u884c\u9047\u8d1f\u9762\u6d88\u606f\u4e5f\u4f1a\u6709\u6324\u5151\uff1b\u4ec5\u5f31\u94f6\u884c\u6324\u5151\u901a\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5f3a\u94f6\u884c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u5ea6\u8fc7\uff1b\u94f6\u884c\u5012\u95ed\u6bd4\u672a\u5012\u95ed\u6324\u5151\u5bf9\u5b58\u6b3e\u548c\u8d37\u6b3e\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u94f6\u884c\u57fa\u672c\u9762\u5dee\u662f\u6324\u5151\u5bfc\u81f4\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u94f6\u884c\u56f0\u5883\u4ea7\u751f\u4e25\u91cd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u540e\u679c\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

As LLMs increasingly serve as evaluators in code-based RL, their ability to detect reward hacking remains understudied. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of reward exploits spanning across 54 categories and introduce TRACE (Testing Reward Anomalies in Code Environments), a synthetically curated and human-verified benchmark containing 517 testing trajectories. Unlike prior work that evaluates reward hack detection in isolated classification scenarios, we contrast these evaluations with a more realistic, contrastive anomaly detection setup on TRACE. Our experiments reveal that models capture reward hacks more effectively in contrastive settings than in isolated classification settings, with GPT-5.2 with highest reasoning mode achieving the best detection rate at 63%, up from 45% in isolated settings on TRACE. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art models struggle significantly more with semantically contextualized reward hacks compared to syntactically contextualized ones. We further conduct qualitative analyses of model behaviors, as well as ablation studies showing that the ratio of benign to hacked trajectories and analysis cluster sizes substantially impact detection performance.

However, variations in individual experiences and different levels of device interactions lead to data and model initialization heterogeneities across devices. Such heterogeneities leave variations in local model parameters across devices that leads to slower convergence. This paper tackles the data and model heterogeneity by explicitly addressing the parameter level varying evidential credence across local models. A novel aggregation approach is introduced that captures these parameter variations in local models and performs robust aggregation of neighbourhood local updates. Specifically, consensus weights are generated via approximation of second-order information of local models on their local datasets. These weights are utilized to scale neighbourhood updates before aggregating them into global neighbourhood representation.

This necessitates Lipschitz constants scaling as $\\exp(\u03a9(R))$ to realize even simple hierarchical targets, yielding exponential sample complexity under capacity control. We then show this obstruction vanishes in hyperbolic space: constant-distortion hyperbolic embeddings admit $O(1)$-Lipschitz realizability, enabling learning with $n = O(mR \\log m)$ samples.

Our edgelighter error model, a variant of the classical lamplighter random walk, iteratively corrupts the graph $G_0$ with edge-dependent noise, creating a sequence of noisy graph copies $(G_t)$. Much of the graph matching literature is focused on anonymization thresholds in edge-independent noise settings, and we establish novel anonymization thresholds in this edge-dependent noise setting when matching $G_0$ and $G_t$. Moreover, we also compare this anonymization threshold with the mixing properties of the Markov chain noise model. We show that when $G_0$ is drawn from an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model, the graph matching anonymization threshold and the mixing time of the edgelighter walk are both of order $\u0398(n^2\\log n)$. We further demonstrate that for more structured model for $G_0$ (e.g., the Stochastic Block Model), graph matching anonymization can occur in $O(n^\u03b1\\log n)$ time for some $\u03b1<2$, indicating that anonymization can occur before the Markov chain noise model globally mixes. Through extensive simulations, we verify our theoretical bounds in the settings of Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs and stochastic block model random graphs, and explore our findings on real-world datasets derived from a Facebook friendship network and a European research institution email communication network.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Next, we analyze the Granularity Layer and evaluate how segmentation strategies like Atomic and Hierarchical chunking mitigate information bottlenecks in long-context documents. Moving to the Orchestration Layer, we discuss methods that transcend the single-vector paradigm, including hierarchical retrieval, agentic decomposition, and multi-stage reranking pipelines to resolve capacity limitations. Finally, we address the Robustness Layer by identifying architectural mitigations for domain generalization failures, lexical blind spots, and the silent degradation of retrieval quality due to temporal drift.

In this paper, we show that disparities arise not only from the structure of the network itself but also from differences in how commuters adapt to it. We model commuters as reinforcement learning agents who adapt their travel choices at different learning rates, reflecting unequal access to resources and information. To capture potential efficiency-fairness tradeoffs, we introduce the Price of Learning (PoL), a measure of inefficiency during learning. We analyze both a stylized network -- inspired in the well-known Braess's paradox, yet with two-source nodes -- and an abstraction of a real-world metro system (Amsterdam). Our simulations show that network expansions can simultaneously increase efficiency and amplify inequality, especially when faster learners disproportionately benefit from new routes before others adapt.

Our error reduction idea is sampling a uniformly random hyperedge of $H$, and repeating the algorithm $k$ times using the hyperedge vertices as seeds. This is a general paradigm, which captures every pseudorandom method generating $k$ seeds without repetition. We show two results which imply a gap between the typical and the worst-case behavior of using $H$ for error-reduction.\n  First, in the context of one-sided error reduction, if using a random hyperedge of $H$ decreases the error probability from $p$ to $p^k + \u03b5$, then $H$ cannot have too few edges, i.e., $|E| = \u03a9(n k^{-1} \u03b5^{-1})$. Thus, the number of random bits needed for reducing the error from $p$ to $p^k + \u03b5$ cannot be reduced below $\\lg n+\\lg(\u03b5^{-1})-\\lg k+O(1)$. This is also true for hypergraphs of average uniformity $k$. Our result implies new lower bounds for dispersers and vertex-expanders.\n  Second, if the vertex degrees are reasonably distributed, we show that in a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of the cases, choosing $k$ pseudorandom seeds using $H$ will reduce the error probability to at most $o(1)$ above the error probability of using $k$ IID seeds, for both algorithms with one- or two-sided error.

We present SuperInfer, a high-performance LLM inference system designed for emerging Superchips (e.g., NVIDIA GH200) with tightly coupled GPU-CPU architecture via NVLink-C2C. SuperInfer introduces RotaSched, the first proactive, SLO-aware rotary scheduler that rotates requests to maintain responsiveness on Superchips, and DuplexKV, an optimized rotation engine that enables full-duplex transfer over NVLink-C2C. Evaluations on GH200 using various models and datasets show that SuperInfer improves TTFT SLO attainment rates by up to 74.7% while maintaining comparable TBT and throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating that SLO-aware scheduling and memory co-design unlocks the full potential of Superchips for responsive LLM serving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edfSuperInfer\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347TTFT SLO\u8fbe\u6807\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u6325\u8d85\u7ea7\u82af\u7247\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u8bf7\u6c42\u7387\u4e0b\u56e0KV\u7f13\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u8017\u5c3d\u6709HOL\u963b\u585e\u95ee\u9898\uff0cPCIe\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683cSLO\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1SuperInfer\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165RotaSched\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u548cDuplexKV\u65cb\u8f6c\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "\u5728GH200\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSuperInfer\u4f7fTTFT SLO\u8fbe\u6807\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe74.7%\uff0cTBT\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "SLO\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u8d85\u7ea7\u82af\u7247\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0fLLM\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing systems largely rely on runtime-centric execution paradigms, repeatedly reading, summarizing, and reasoning over large volumes of scientific literature online. This on-the-spot computation strategy incurs high computational cost, suffers from context window limitations, and often leads to brittle reasoning and hallucination. We propose Idea2Story, a pre-computation-driven framework for autonomous scientific discovery that shifts literature understanding from online reasoning to offline knowledge construction. Idea2Story continuously collects peer-reviewed papers together with their review feedback, extracts core methodological units, composes reusable research patterns, and organizes them into a structured methodological knowledge graph. At runtime, underspecified user research intents are aligned to established research paradigms, enabling efficient retrieval and reuse of high-quality research patterns instead of open-ended generation and trial-and-error. By grounding research planning and execution in a pre-built knowledge graph, Idea2Story alleviates the context window bottleneck of LLMs and substantially reduces repeated runtime reasoning over literature. We conduct qualitative analyses and preliminary empirical studies demonstrating that Idea2Story can generate coherent, methodologically grounded, and novel research patterns, and can produce several high-quality research demonstrations in an end-to-end setting.

Their growing popularity and demonstrated predictive accuracy in political elections have raised speculation and concern regarding their susceptibility to manipulation and the potential consequences for democratic processes. Using agent-based simulations combined with an analytic characterization of price dynamics, we study how high-budget agents can introduce price distortions in prediction markets. We explore the persistence and stability of these distortions in the presence of herding or stubborn agents, and analyze how agent expertise affects market-price variance. Firstly we propose an agent-based model of a prediction market in which bettors with heterogeneous expertise, noisy private information, variable learning rates and budgets observe the evolution of public opinion on a binary election outcome to inform their betting strategies in the market. The model exhibits stability across a broad parameter space, with complex agent behaviors and price interactions producing self-regulatory price discovery. Second, using this simulation framework, we investigate the conditions under which a highly resourced minority, or ''whale'' agent, with a biased valuation can distort the market price, and for how long. We find that biased whales can temporarily shift prices, with the magnitude and duration of distortion increasing when non-whale bettors exhibit herding behavior and slow learning. Our theoretical analysis corroborates these results, showing that whales can shift prices proportionally to their share of market capital, with distortion duration depending on non-whale learning rates and herding intensity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u5408\u4ef7\u683c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u9884\u7b97\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u5236\u9020\u4ef7\u683c\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53ca\u4ee3\u7406\u4e13\u4e1a\u6027\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u9009\u4e3e\u4e2d\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u62c5\u5fc3\u5176\u6613\u53d7\u64cd\u7eb5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6c11\u4e3b\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u683c\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u201c\u9cb8\u9c7c\u201d\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u4e34\u65f6\u6539\u53d8\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u975e\u201c\u9cb8\u9c7c\u201d\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7f8a\u7fa4\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6162\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ef7\u683c\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6b64\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u201c\u9cb8\u9c7c\u201d\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u5176\u5e02\u573a\u8d44\u672c\u4efd\u989d\u6539\u53d8\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u4ef7\u683c\u626d\u66f2\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u975e\u201c\u9cb8\u9c7c\u201d\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u7f8a\u7fa4\u884c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Prior research shows that the adoption and use of AI-powered tools differ between core and peripheral developers. However, it remains unclear how this dynamic unfolds in the emerging era of autonomous coding agents. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of 9,427 agentic PRs, examining how core and peripheral developers use, review, modify, and verify agent-generated contributions prior to acceptance. Through a mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis, we make four key contributions. First, a subset of peripheral developers use agents more often, delegating tasks evenly across bug fixing, feature addition, documentation, and testing. In contrast, core developers focus more on documentation and testing, yet their agentic PRs are frequently merged into the main/master branch. Second, core developers engage slightly more in review discussions than peripheral developers, and both groups focus on evolvability issues. Third, agentic PRs are less likely to be modified, but when they are, both groups commonly perform refactoring. Finally, peripheral developers are more likely to merge without running CI checks, whereas core developers more consistently require passing verification before acceptance.

Image-level mixed sample data augmentations, such as CutMix and MixUp, are frequently used for training transformers, yet these techniques perturb patient-specific attributes, such as medical comorbidity and clinical factors, since they only account for images and labels. To address this limitation, we propose a hierarchical sampling strategy, Oculomix, for mixed sample augmentations. Our method is based on two clinical priors. First (exam level), images acquired from the same patient at the same time point share the same attributes. Second (patient level), images acquired from the same patient at different time points have a soft temporal trend, as morbidity generally increases over time. Guided by these priors, our method constrains the mixing space to the patient and exam levels to better preserve patient-specific characteristics and leverages their hierarchical relationships. The proposed method is validated using ViT models on a five-year prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a large ethnically diverse population (Alzeye).

This paper shows that maximum likelihood estimation of finite mixtures of parametric densities can suffer from substantial finite-sample bias in all parameters under mild regularity conditions. The bias arises from the influence of outliers in component densities with unbounded or large support and increases with the degree of overlap among mixture components. I show that maximizing the classification-mixture likelihood function, equipped with a consistent classifier, yields parameter estimates that are less biased than those obtained by standard maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). I then derive the asymptotic distribution of the resulting estimator and provide conditions under which oracle efficiency is achieved. Monte Carlo simulations show that conventional mixture MLE exhibits pronounced finite-sample bias, which diminishes as the sample size or the statistical distance between component densities tends to infinity. The simulations further show that the proposed estimation strategy generally outperforms standard MLE in finite samples in terms of both bias and mean squared errors under relatively weak assumptions. An empirical application to latent group panel structures using health administrative data shows that the proposed approach reduces out-of-sample prediction error by approximately 17.6% relative to the best results obtained from standard MLE procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u6df7\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u6781\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5206\u7c7b - \u6df7\u5408\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6 MLE\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6709\u9650\u6df7\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u6781\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5206\u7c7b - \u6df7\u5408\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u4e00\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u6240\u5f97\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fbe\u5230 oracle \u6548\u7387\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u6df7\u5408 MLE \u6709\u660e\u663e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u901a\u5e38\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6 MLE \u7a0b\u5e8f\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6 17.6% \u7684\u6837\u672c\u5916\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6 MLE \u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5916\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002"}}

The independence of clones axiom then states that removing one of the two clones should not change the election outcome. This axiom has been extensively studied in social choice theory, and several voting rules are known to satisfy it (such as IRV, Ranked Pairs and Schulze). However, perfect clones are unlikely to occur in practice, especially for political elections with many voters.\n  In this work, we study different notions of approximate clones in ordinal elections. Informally, two candidates are approximate clones in a preference profile if they are close to being perfect clones. We discuss two measures to quantify this proximity, and we show under which conditions the voting rules that are known to be independent of clones are also independent of approximate clones. In particular, we show that for elections with at least four candidates, none of these rules are independent of approximate clones in the general case. However, we find a more positive result for the case of three candidates. Finally, we conduct an empirical study of approximate clones and independence of approximate clones based on three real-world datasets: votes in local Scottish elections, votes in mini-jury deliberations, and votes of judges in figure skating competitions. We find that approximate clones are common in some contexts, and that the closest two candidates are to being perfect clones, the less likely their removal is to change the election outcome, especially for voting rules that are independent of perfect clones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e8f\u6570\u9009\u4e3e\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u514b\u9686\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5df2\u77e5\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u514b\u9686\u7684\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u514b\u9686\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u514b\u9686\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u5e38\u89c1\u4e14\u8d8a\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u514b\u9686\u79fb\u9664\u8d8a\u4e0d\u6613\u6539\u53d8\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b8c\u7f8e\u514b\u9686\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9009\u4e3e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u8fd1\u4f3c\u514b\u9686\u5728\u5e8f\u6570\u9009\u4e3e\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\u514b\u9686\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5df2\u77e5\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u514b\u9686\u7684\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u514b\u9686\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81f3\u5c11\u56db\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u7684\u9009\u4e3e\uff0c\u5df2\u77e5\u89c4\u5219\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u514b\u9686\uff1b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u65f6\u6709\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u514b\u9686\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u8d8a\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u514b\u9686\u79fb\u9664\u6539\u53d8\u9009\u4e3e\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u8d8a\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd1\u4f3c\u514b\u9686\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9009\u4e3e\u4e2d\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5df2\u77e5\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u514b\u9686\u7684\u6295\u7968\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u514b\u9686\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd1\u4f3c\u514b\u9686\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u514b\u9686\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u79fb\u9664\u5f71\u54cd\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

The required edge-connectivity $k$ is a chosen, constant parameter. Unlike standard dynamic graph problems, such as dynamic minimum-cut, which focus solely on reporting the value of the minimum cut, our approach actively modifies the graph $G$ to maintain the edge-connectivity invariant $\u03bb(G) \\ge k$. We address two fundamental maintenance tasks: redundancy elimination, which identifies and removes an existing edge rendered redundant for $k$-edge-connectivity by new edge insertion, and connectivity restoration, which computes and inserts a minimal set of augmenting edges to restore graph's $k$-edge-connectivity following an old edge deletion. To preclude trivial reversals, we strictly enforce that the eliminated edge is distinct from the inserted edge and that restoration excludes the already deleted edge. Our solution of the first problem integrates Nagamochi-Ibaraki sparse certificates [Nagamochi and Ibaraki 1992] with Link-Cut Trees [Sleator and Tarjan 1983] to remove redundant edges in $O(k \\log n)$ amortized time. For restoration, we propose a localized augmentation strategy that exploits the residual graph structure to bridge the minimum cut.

The method first constructs system state representations from high-dimensional metric sequences, applies nonlinear transformations to extract cross-dimensional dynamic features, and integrates multiple source information such as resource utilization, scheduling behavior, and task load variations within a shared representation space. It then introduces a graph-based modeling mechanism to capture latent dependencies among metrics, allowing the model to learn competitive propagation patterns and structural interference across resource links. On this basis, task-specific mapping structures are designed to model the differences among contention types and enhance the classifier's ability to distinguish multiple contention patterns. To achieve stable performance, the method employs an adaptive multi-task loss weighting strategy that balances shared feature learning with task-specific feature extraction and generates final contention predictions through a standardized inference process. Experiments conducted on a public system trace dataset demonstrate advantages in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1, and sensitivity analyses on batch size, training sample scale, and metric dimensionality further confirm the model's stability and applicability. The study shows that structured representations and multi-task classification based on high-dimensional metrics can significantly improve contention pattern recognition and offer a reliable technical approach for performance management in complex computing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u4e89\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e89\u7528\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e89\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e89\u7528\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6620\u5c04\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5404\u9879\u6307\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e89\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u6027\u80fd\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u6280\u672f\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator. IA has been launched for Amazon sellers in US, which has achieved high accuracy of 90% based on human evaluation, with latency of P90 below 15s.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5f00\u53d1Insight Agents\uff08IA\uff09\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u6d1e\u5bdf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5356\u5bb6\u4e0a\u7ebf\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe90%\uff0cP90\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f4e\u4e8e15\u79d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5546\u5356\u5bb6\u9762\u4e34\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5229\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5de5\u5177\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1IA\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u5356\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u51b3\u7b56\u7cbe\u529b\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u51b3\u7b56\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u5212 - \u6267\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4e3a\u7ba1\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u5408OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eBERT\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7684ML\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1API\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6218\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "IA\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5356\u5bb6\u4e0a\u7ebf\uff0c\u7ecf\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe90%\uff0cP90\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f4e\u4e8e15\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "IA\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4e3a\u7535\u5546\u5356\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u51b3\u7b56\u7cbe\u529b\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u51b3\u7b56\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002"}}

In this work, we present Cheap2Rich, a multi-scale data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-fidelity state spaces from sparse sensor histories by combining a fast low-fidelity prior with learned, interpretable discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on rotating detonation engines (RDEs), a challenging class of systems that couple detonation-front propagation with injector-driven unsteadiness, mixing, and stiff chemistry across disparate scales. Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects. The results highlight a general multi-fidelity framework for data assimilation and system identification in complex multi-scale systems, enabling rapid design exploration and real-time monitoring and control while providing interpretable discrepancy dynamics.

Leveraging monthly data from 2008 to 2025 and a donor pool of advanced economies, we estimate counterfactual paths using a matrix completion design with rolling-window cross-validation and placebo-based inference, corroborated by synthetic difference-in-differences. We document three core findings. First, long-horizon sovereign risk of Israel is persistently repriced. Ten-year yields and spreads relative to the United States rise sharply and remain elevated. Second, household welfare beliefs deteriorate durably, as reflected in consumer confidence. Third, medium-run momentum improves, captured by a strong rise in the OECD composite leading indicator.

Although such PRs promise productivity gains, their post-merge code quality remains underexplored, as prior work has largely relied on benchmarks and controlled tasks rather than large-scale post-merge analyses. To address this gap, we analyze 1,210 merged agent-generated bug-fix PRs from Python repositories in the AIDev dataset. Using SonarQube, we perform a differential analysis between base and merged commits to identify code quality issues newly introduced by PR changes. We examine issue frequency, density, severity, and rule-level prevalence across five agents.

Across all agents, code smells dominate, particularly at critical and major severities, while bugs are less frequent but often severe.

In these architectures, each neuron is mapped to a dedicated hardware unit, making them well-suited for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Previous unrolled implementations mostly focus on fully connected networks because of their simplicity, although it is well known that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require fewer computations for the same accuracy. When observing the data flow in CNNs, pooling layers and convolutional layers with a stride larger than one, the number of data at their output is reduced with respect to their input. This data reduction strongly affects the data rate in a fully parallel implementation, making hardware units heavily underutilized unless it is handled properly. This work addresses this issue by analyzing the data flow of CNNs and presents a novel approach to designing data-rate-aware, continuous-flow CNN architectures. The proposed approach ensures a high hardware utilization close to 100% by interleaving low data rate signals and sharing hardware units, as well as using the right parallelization to achieve the throughput of a fully parallel implementation.

Fairness auditing addresses these risks through two primary functions: certification, which verifies adherence to fairness constraints; and flagging, which isolates specific demographic groups experiencing disparate treatment. However, existing auditing techniques are frequently limited by restrictive distributional assumptions or prohibitive computational overhead. We propose a novel empirical likelihood-based (EL) framework that constructs robust statistical measures for model performance disparities. Unlike traditional methods, our approach is non-parametric; the proposed disparity statistics follow asymptotically chi-square or mixed chi-square distributions, ensuring valid inference without assuming underlying data distributions. This framework uses a constrained optimization profile that admits stable numerical solutions, facilitating both large-scale certification and efficient subpopulation discovery. Empirically, the EL methods outperform bootstrap-based approaches, yielding coverage rates closer to nominal levels while reducing computational latency by several orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the practical utility of this framework on the COMPAS dataset, where it successfully flags intersectional biases, specifically identifying a significantly higher positive prediction rate for African-American males under 25 and a systemic under-prediction for Caucasian females relative to the population mean.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u4ea4\u53c9\u504f\u5dee", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u654f\u611f\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u53d7\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9650\u5236", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4f3c\u7136\uff08EL\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u975e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u8f6e\u5ed3", "result": "EL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u540d\u4e49\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff1b\u5728COMPAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u4ea4\u53c9\u504f\u5dee", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7684EL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027"}}

Heavy tails, multimodality, nonlinear dependencies, and sparse special-cause observations can distort baseline estimation, mask true anomalies, and prevent reliable identification of an in-control (IC) reference set. To address these challenges, we introduce VSCOUT, a distribution-free framework designed specifically for retrospective (Phase I) monitoring in high-dimensional settings. VSCOUT combines an Automatic Relevance Determination Variational Autoencoder (ARD-VAE) architecture with ensemble-based latent outlier filtering and changepoint detection. The ARD prior isolates the most informative latent dimensions, while the ensemble and changepoint filters identify pointwise and structural contamination within the determined latent space. A second-stage retraining step removes flagged observations and re-estimates the latent structure using only the retained inliers, mitigating masking and stabilizing the IC latent manifold. This two-stage refinement produces a clean and reliable IC baseline suitable for subsequent Phase II deployment. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that VSCOUT achieves superior sensitivity to special-cause structure while maintaining controlled false alarms, outperforming classical SPC procedures, robust estimators, and modern machine-learning baselines.

However, these signals are only indirect proxies of user satisfaction and often suffer from noise and bias. Recently, explicit satisfaction feedback collected through questionnaires has emerged as a high-quality direct alignment supervision, but is extremely sparse and easily overwhelmed by abundant behavioral data, making it difficult to incorporate into online recommendation models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework which is towards End-to-End Alignment of user Satisfaction via Questionaire, named EASQ, to enable real-time alignment of ranking models with true user satisfaction. Specifically, we first construct an independent parameter pathway for sparse questionnaire signals by combining a multi-task architecture and a lightweight LoRA module. The multi-task design separates sparse satisfaction supervision from dense behavioral signals, preventing the former from being overwhelmed. The LoRA module pre-inject these preferences in a parameter-isolated manner, ensuring stability in the backbone while optimizing user satisfaction. Furthermore, we employ a DPO-based optimization objective tailored for online learning, which aligns the main model outputs with sparse satisfaction signals in real time. This design enables end-to-end online learning, allowing the model to continuously adapt to new questionnaire feedback while maintaining the stability and effectiveness of the backbone.

We investigate the problem of maintaining spanners in the fully dynamic setting with an adaptive adversary. Despite a long line of research, this problem is still poorly understood: no algorithm achieving a sublogarithmic stretch, a sublinear in $n$ update time, and a strongly subquadratic in $n$ spanner size is currently known.\n  One of our main results is a deterministic algorithm, that, for any $512 \\leq k \\leq (\\log n)^{1/49}$ and $1/k\\leq \u03b4\\leq 1/400$, maintains a spanner $H$ of a fully dynamic graph with stretch $poly(k)\\cdot 2^{O(1/\u03b4^6)}$ and size $|E(H)|\\leq O(n^{1+O(1/k)})$, with worst-case update time $n^{O(\u03b4)}$ and recourse $n^{O(1/k)}$. Our algorithm relies on a new technical tool that we develop, called low-diameter router decomposition. We design a deterministic algorithm that maintains a decomposition of a fully dynamic graph into edge-disjoint clusters with bounded vertex overlap, where each cluster $C$ is a bounded-diameter router, meaning that any reasonable multicommodity demand over the vertices of $C$ can be routed along short paths and with low congestion. A similar graph decomposition notion was introduced by [Haeupler et al., STOC 2022] and strengthened by [Haeupler et al., FOCS 2024]. However, in contrast to these and other prior works, the decomposition that our algorithm maintains is proper, ensuring that the routing paths between the pairs of vertices of each cluster $C$ are contained inside $C$, rather than in the entire graph $G$. We show additional applications of our router decomposition, including dynamic algorithms for fault-tolerant spanners and low-congestion spanners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5168\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ef4\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4f4e\u76f4\u5f84\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5bb9\u9519\u548c\u4f4e\u62e5\u585e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ef4\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c1a\u65e0\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b21\u5bf9\u6570\u62c9\u4f38\u3001\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5f3a\u6b21\u4e8c\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4f4e\u76f4\u5f84\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u5168\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8fb9\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u3001\u9876\u70b9\u91cd\u53e0\u6709\u754c\u7684\u7c07\uff0c\u4e14\u7c07\u5185\u8def\u7531\u8def\u5f84\u5728\u7c07\u5185\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f512 \u2264 k \u2264 (log n)^(1/49) \u548c 1/k \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 1/400\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u62c9\u4f38\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a n^(O(\u03b4))\uff0c\u56de\u6eaf\u4e3a n^(O(1/k))\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u4f4e\u76f4\u5f84\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u5de5\u5177\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u52a8\u6001\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, the advent of large-scale recommenders also brings significantly higher computational costs, particularly under the long-sequence dependencies inherent in the user intent of recommendation systems. Current approaches often rely on pre-storing the intermediate states of the past behavior for each user, thereby reducing the quadratic re-computation cost for the following requests. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often treat memory merely as a medium for acceleration, without adequately considering the space overhead it introduces. This presents a critical challenge in real-world recommendation systems with billions of users, each of whom might initiate thousands of interactions and require massive memory for state storage. Fortunately, there have been several memory management strategies examined for compression in LLM, while most have not been evaluated on the recommendation task. To mitigate this gap, we introduce MALLOC, a comprehensive benchmark for memory-aware long sequence compression. MALLOC presents a comprehensive investigation and systematic classification of memory management techniques applicable to large sequential recommendations. These techniques are integrated into state-of-the-art recommenders, enabling a reproducible and accessible evaluation platform. Through extensive experiments across accuracy, efficiency, and complexity, we demonstrate the holistic reliability of MALLOC in advancing large-scale recommendation.

In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u540c\u4f34\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6297\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u9006\u7f29\u653e\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f46\u56f0\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u5e38\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u76d1\u7763\u4ea7\u751f\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u540c\u4f34\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6307\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u8bda\u5b9e\u548c\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6297\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u9006\u7f29\u653e\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540c\u4f34\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u7684LLM-as-a-Judge\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We empirically validate our theoretical results on two applications of minimum-cost flow, i.e., traffic networks and chip escape routing, in which we learn a fixed prediction, and a feature-based neural network model to infer the prediction, respectively.

These workloads often combine multiple parallel runtimes within the same application or across co-located jobs, creating scheduling demands that place significant stress on traditional OS schedulers. When oversubscribed (there are more ready threads than cores), OS schedulers rely on periodic preemptions to multiplex cores, often introducing interference that may degrade performance. In this paper, we present: (1) The User-space Scheduling Framework (USF), a novel seamless process scheduling framework completely implemented in user-space. USF enables users to implement their own process scheduling algorithms without requiring special permissions. We evaluate USF with its default cooperative policy, (2) SCHED_COOP, designed to reduce interference by switching threads only upon blocking. This approach mitigates well-known issues such as Lock-Holder Preemption (LHP), Lock-Waiter Preemption (LWP), and scalability collapse. We implement USF and SCHED_COOP by extending the GNU C library with the nOS-V runtime, enabling seamless coordination across multiple runtimes (e.g., OpenMP) without requiring invasive application changes.

However, traditional change detection methods based on remote sensing imagery have obvious limitations in high-level and intelligent analysis, and thus are difficult to meet the requirements of current urban planning and management. In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge.

While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u5c0f\u7ec4\u5408\u4f5c\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5408\u4f5c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7fa4\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5408\u4f5c\u89c4\u8303\u53ef\u5ef6\u4f38\u81f3AI\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4eba\u673a\u4e8c\u5143\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u5176\u5bf9AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u7ec4\u5408\u4f5c\u89c4\u8303\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u7ef4\u6301\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u56db\u4eba\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6bcf\u7ec4\u4e09\u4eba\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e3a\u4eba\u6216AI\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6709\u4e09\u79cd\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4e92\u60e0\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u60ef\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4eba\u673a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0b\u5408\u4f5c\u6c34\u5e73\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u89c4\u8303\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u89c4\u8303\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e5f\u65e0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u4f5c\u89c4\u8303\u5177\u6709\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u5ef6\u4f38\u81f3\u4eba\u5de5\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u96c6\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u4eba\u4e0eAI\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002"}}

This strength stems from their defining feature: the use of explicit task instructions during fine-tuning, which enables them to bridge natural language and code by translating human intent into executable code. While much of their progress has been driven by advances in scaling laws and training methodologies, one critical aspect remains underexplored--the impact of system prompts on the performance of both general-purpose ILMs and specialized CLMs when instantiated to assist users with code generation activities.

On TREC-DL 2019/2020 with BERT and monoT5 re-rankers, our single-word attacks achieve up to 91% success while modifying fewer than two tokens per document on average, achieving competitive rank and score boosts with far fewer edits under a comparable white-box setup to ensure fair evaluation against PRADA. We also introduce new diagnostic metrics to analyze attack sensitivity beyond aggregate success rates. Our analysis reveals a Goldilocks zone in which mid-ranked documents are most vulnerable. These findings demonstrate practical risks and motivate future defenses for robust neural ranking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u5b57\u67e5\u8be2\u611f\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u795e\u7ecf\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff08NRMs\uff09\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u653b\u51fb\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6587\u6863\u6392\u540d\u8106\u5f31\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "NRMs\u867d\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5355\u5b57\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u63d2\u5165\u70b9\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728TREC - DL 2019/2020\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5355\u5b57\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe91%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4efd\u6587\u6863\u4fee\u6539\u4e0d\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u767d\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u6587\u6863\u6700\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eNRMs\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9632\u5fa1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u3002"}}

AutoOverlap introduces a communication chunk abstraction that decouples communication granularity from kernel structure and backend mechanisms, allowing chunk-level plans to be ported from existing distributed compilers, written directly by users, or instantiated from reusable templates. Given a local Triton kernel and a chunk schedule, AutoOverlap performs transformations to align computation with chunk availability.

We introduce $\\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution.

Evaluated on CI logs from 20 open-source Android projects using GitHub Actions, LogSieve achieves an average 42% reduction in lines and 40% reduction in tokens with minimal semantic loss. This pre-inference reduction lowers computational cost and can proportionally reduce energy use (and associated emissions) by decreasing the volume of data processed during LLM inference.\n  Compared with structure-first baselines (LogZip and random-line removal), LogSieve preserves much higher semantic and categorical fidelity (Cosine = 0.93, GPTScore = 0.93, 80% exact-match accuracy).

We benchmark 21 widely used classifiers, including linear models, SVMs, tree ensembles (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM), and modern tabular neural and foundation models, on binary tasks from the TabArena-v0.1 suite using randomized, stratified five-fold cross-validation with a held-out test fold. Five calibrators; Isotonic regression, Platt scaling, Beta calibration, Venn-Abers predictors, and Pearsonify are trained on a separate calibration split and applied to test predictions. Calibration is evaluated using proper scoring rules (log-loss and Brier score) and diagnostic measures (Spiegelhalter's Z, ECE, and ECI), alongside discrimination (AUC-ROC) and standard classification metrics. Across tasks and architectures, Venn-Abers predictors achieve the largest average reductions in log-loss, followed closely by Beta calibration, while Platt scaling exhibits weaker and less consistent effects. Beta calibration improves log-loss most frequently across tasks, whereas Venn-Abers displays fewer instances of extreme degradation and slightly more instances of extreme improvement. Importantly, we find that commonly used calibration procedures, most notably Platt scaling and isotonic regression, can systematically degrade proper scoring performance for strong modern tabular models. Overall classification performance is often preserved, but calibration effects vary substantially across datasets and architectures, and no method dominates uniformly. In expectation, all methods except Pearsonify slightly increase accuracy, but the effect is marginal, with the largest expected gain about 0.008%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4e8b\u540e\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf921\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Venn - Abers\u548cBeta\u6821\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5e38\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6539\u8fdb\u76d1\u7763\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u5177\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u7531\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528TabArena - v0.1\u5957\u4ef6\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5206\u5c42\u4e94\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u79cd\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "Venn - Abers\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4elog - loss\u6700\u591a\uff0cBeta\u6821\u51c6\u6b21\u4e4b\uff1bPlatt\u7f29\u653e\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5f31\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u5e38\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5f3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u9664Pearsonify\u5916\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u65e0\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Each edge is modeled as either a binary symmetric channel (BSC) or a binary erasure channel (BEC). We analyze two operational regimes. For binary symmetric and binary erasure channels, we provide a structural characterization of the induced learning dynamics. In a fast-communication regime, agents update using channel-averaged payoffs; the resulting learning dynamics coincide with a Gibbs sampler for a scaled coordination potential, where channel reliability enters only through a scalar attenuation coefficient. In a snapshot regime, agents update from a single noisy realization and ignore channel statistics; the induced Markov chain is generally nonreversible, but admits a high-temperature expansion whose drift matches that of the fast Gibbs sampler with the same attenuation. We further formalize a finite-$K$ communication budget, which interpolates between snapshot and fast behavior as the number of channel uses per update grows.

We make two main contributions. First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity.

To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration.

However, sophisticated software supply chain security threats often stem from cascaded vulnerability and security weakness chains that span dependent components. Moreover, although the adoption of Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) has been accelerating, downstream vulnerability findings vary substantially across SBOM generators and analysis tools. We propose a novel approach to SBOM-driven security analysis methods and tools. We model vulnerability relationships over dependency structure rather than treating scanner outputs as independent records. We represent enriched SBOMs as heterogeneous graphs with nodes being the SBOM components and dependencies, the known software vulnerabilities, and the known software security weaknesses. We then train a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HGAT) to predict whether a component is associated with at least one known vulnerability. Since documented multi-vulnerability chains are scarce, we model cascade discovery as a link prediction problem over CVE pairs using a multi-layer perceptron neural network. This way, we produce ranked candidate links that can be composed into multi-step paths.

However, treating predictions as ground truth introduces bias while ignoring them wastes valuable information. Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) offers a principled framework that leverages predictions from large unlabeled datasets to improve statistical efficiency while maintaining valid inference through explicit bias correction using a smaller labeled subset. Despite its potential, the growing PPI variants and the subtle distinctions between them have made it challenging for practitioners to determine when and how to apply these methods responsibly. This paper demystifies PPI by synthesizing its theoretical foundations, methodological extensions, connections to existing statistics literature, and diagnostic tools into a unified practical workflow. Using the Mosaiks housing price data, we show that PPI variants produce tighter confidence intervals than complete-case analysis, but that double-dipping, i.e. reusing training data for inference, leads to anti-conservative confidence intervals and coverages.

However, these generative views can be incorrect because diffusion generation may introduce hallucinated visual cues that conflict with the original query text. Indeed, we empirically demonstrate that these hallucinated cues can substantially degrade DAI-TIR performance. To address this, we propose Diffusion-aware Multi-view Contrastive Learning (DMCL), a hallucination-robust training framework that casts DAI-TIR as joint optimization over representations of query intent and the target image. DMCL introduces semantic-consistency and diffusion-aware contrastive objectives to align textual and diffusion-generated query views while suppressing hallucinated query signals. This yields an encoder that acts as a semantic filter, effectively mapping hallucinated cues into a null space, improving robustness to spurious cues and better representing the user's intent. Attention visualization and geometric embedding-space analyses corroborate this filtering behavior. Across five standard benchmarks, DMCL delivers consistent improvements in multi-round Hits@10, reaching as high as 7.37\\% over prior fine-tuned and zero-shot baselines, which indicates it is a general and robust training framework for DAI-TIR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8eDAI - TIR\u7684\u6297\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6DMCL\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "DAI - TIR\u4e2d\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u6587\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDMCL\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6269\u6563\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06DAI - TIR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDMCL\u4f7f\u591a\u8f6eHits@10\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u5fae\u8c03\u53ca\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad87.37%\u3002", "conclusion": "DMCL\u662f\u7528\u4e8eDAI - TIR\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Recent research on Agentic AI (AAI) increasingly integrates reasoning systems powered by Large Language Models; however, these tools are not applicable to infrastructure-level systems due to their high computational cost, stochastic nature, and poor formal analyzability. In this paper, a generic model, Agentic Fog (AF), is presented, in which fog nodes are represented as policy-driven autonomous agents that communicate via p2p interactions based on shared memory and localized coordination. The suggested architecture decomposes a system's goals into abstract policy guidance and formalizes decentralized fog coordination as an exact potential game. The framework is guaranteed to converge and remain stable under asynchronous updates, bounded-rational best-response dynamics, and node failures. Simulations demonstrate that the AF system achieves lower average latency and adapts more efficiently to varying demand than greedy heuristics and integer linear programming under dynamic conditions. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrates the capability to perform optimally under different memory and coordination conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAgentic Fog (AF)\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8d2a\u5fc3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u96fe\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u73b0\u6709Agentic AI\u5de5\u5177\u56e0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAF\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u96fe\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u534f\u8c03\u7684p2p\u4ea4\u4e92\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u6307\u5bfc\u5e76\u5c06\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u96fe\u534f\u8c03\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u52bf\u535a\u5f08\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793aAF\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u6c42\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AF\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u96fe\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

The paradigm takes inspiration from the autonomous nervous system and employs a probabilistic neuron (p-neuron) driven by an analog feature extraction circuit. The response time of the system is on the order of microseconds, over-coming the sub-sampling-rate response time limit and enabling real-time intelligent autonomous activation of data-sampling. Validation experiments on active seismic survey data demonstrate lossless probabilistic data acquisition, with a normalized mean squared error of 0.41%, and 93% saving in the active operation time of the system and the number of generated samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u4f20\u611f\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u635f\u6982\u7387\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u5e76\u8282\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u51b3\u7b56\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u81ea\u4e3b\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7531\u6a21\u62df\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u7535\u8def\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6982\u7387\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff08p - neuron\uff09\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u8fbe\u5fae\u79d2\u7ea7\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u4e3b\u52a8\u5730\u9707\u52d8\u63a2\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u635f\u6982\u7387\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee0.41%\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u6570\u8282\u770193%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6982\u7387\u4f20\u611f\u8303\u5f0f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, existing approaches often rely on large models (7B to 32B parameters) with reasoning-based distillation, incurring unnecessary computational overhead while primarily focusing on textual modalities. In this paper, we propose Rank-Nexus, a multimodal image-text document reranker that performs listwise qualitative reranking on retrieved lists incorporating both images and texts. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a progressive cross-modal training strategy. We first train modalities separately: leveraging abundant text reranking data, we distill knowledge into the text branch. For images, where data is scarce, we construct distilled pairs from multimodal large language model (MLLM) captions on image retrieval benchmarks. Subsequently, we distill a joint image-text reranking dataset. Rank-Nexus achieves outstanding performance on text reranking benchmarks (TREC, BEIR) and the challenging image reranking benchmark (INQUIRE, MMDocIR), using only a lightweight 2B pretrained visual-language model. This efficient design ensures strong generalization across diverse multimodal scenarios without excessive parameters or reasoning overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRank - Nexus\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u672c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u514b\u670d\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u50cf - \u6587\u672c\u6587\u6863\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u56e0\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u4fa7\u91cd\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRank - Nexus\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u5206\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u518d\u63d0\u70bc\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Rank - Nexus\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u8fc7\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u3002"}}

Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6AMA\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u7c92\u5ea6\u50f5\u5316\u3001\u7ef4\u62a4\u7b56\u7565\u91cd\u79ef\u7d2f\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b58\u50a8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u53ca\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Constructor\u548cRetriever\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5185\u5b58\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u8def\u7531\uff0cJudge\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0cRefresher\u7ef4\u62a4\u5185\u5b58\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAMA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea680%\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "AMA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5185\u5b58\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

It is therefore important to understand the extent of these contributions and how human developers review and intervene, since these factors shape the risks of delegating work to AI agents. While recent studies have examined how AI agents support software development tasks (e.g., code generation, issue resolution, and PR automation), their role in documentation tasks remains underexplored-even though documentation is widely consumed and shapes how developers understand and use software.\n  Using the AIDev, we analyze 1,997 documentation-related pull requests (PRs) authored by AI agents and human developers, where documentation PRs are those that create or modify project documentation artifacts. We find that AI agents submit substantially more documentation-related PRs than humans in the studied repositories. We further observe that agent-authored documentation edits are typically integrated with little follow-up modification from humans, raising concerns about review practices and the reliability of agent-generated documentation.

Existing caching methods reduce redundant computation but typically rely on instantaneous velocity information (e.g., feature caching), which often leads to severe trajectory deviations and error accumulation under high acceleration ratios. MeanCache introduces an average-velocity perspective: by leveraging cached Jacobian--vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities from instantaneous velocities, it effectively mitigates local error accumulation. To further improve cache timing and JVP reuse stability, we develop a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy as a practical tool, employing a Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints to determine the schedule. Experiments on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that MeanCache achieves 4.12X and 4.56X and 3.59X acceleration, respectively, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art caching baselines in generation quality.

We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process.

This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTask - Conditioned Latent Alignment (TCLA)\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u7315\u7334\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u690d\u5165\u7535\u6781\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u662f\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\uff08BCIs\uff09\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65b0\u4f1a\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c24\u4e3a\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTCLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5148\u4ece\u6709\u5145\u8db3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6e90\u4f1a\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u518d\u4ee5\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u6e90\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7315\u7334\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u4f1a\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cTCLA\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2dy\u5750\u6807\u901f\u5ea6\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u7cfb\u6570\u589e\u76ca\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe0.386\u3002", "conclusion": "TCLA\u4e3a\u6e90\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose RAPID-Graph to address this challenge through a co-designed processing-in-memory (PIM) system that integrates algorithm, architecture, and device-level optimizations. At the algorithm level, we introduce a recursion-aware partitioner that enables an exact APSP computation by decomposing graphs into vertex tiles to reduce data dependency, such that both Floyd-Warshall and Min-Plus kernels execute fully in-place within digital PIM arrays. At the architecture and device levels, we design a 2.5D PIM stack integrating two phase-change memory compute dies, a logic die, and high-bandwidth scratchpad memory within a unified advanced package.

In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl.

However, recent vulnerabilities in third-party packages have led to serious security breaches, compromising the integrity of applications that depend on them. Objective: This study investigates how npm package developers perceive and handle security in their work. We examined developers' understanding of security risks, the practices and tools they use, the barriers to stronger security measures, and their suggestions for improving the npm ecosystem's security. Method: We conducted an online survey with 75 npm package developers and undertook a mixed-methods approach to analyzing their responses. Results: While developers prioritize security, they perceive their packages as only moderately secure, with concerns about supply chain attacks, dependency vulnerabilities, and malicious code. Only 40% are satisfied with the current npm security tools due to issues such as alert fatigue. Automated methods such as two-factor authentication and npm audit are favored over code reviews. Many drop dependencies due to abandonment or vulnerabilities, and typically respond to vulnerabilities in their packages by quickly releasing patches. Key barriers include time constraints and high false-positive rates. To improve npm security, developers seek better detection tools, clearer documentation, stronger account protections, and more education initiatives. Conclusion: Our findings will benefit npm package contributors and maintainers by highlighting prevalent security challenges and promoting discussions on best practices to strengthen security and trustworthiness within the npm landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8c03\u67e5npm\u5305\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u770b\u5f85\u548c\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5305\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e00\u822c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "npm\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5305\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5371\u53ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5305\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76npm\u5305\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5bf975\u540dnpm\u5305\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u56de\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u91cd\u89c6\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5305\u4ec5\u5904\u4e8e\u4e2d\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\u7b49\u6709\u62c5\u5fe7\uff1b\u4ec540%\u5bf9\u5f53\u524dnpm\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u5177\u6709\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff1b\u503e\u5411\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u56e0\u5404\u79cd\u539f\u56e0\u4e22\u5f03\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e38\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5e03\u8865\u4e01\u4fee\u590d\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1b\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u662f\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u548c\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8enpm\u5305\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a81\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5173\u4e8e\u52a0\u5f3anpm\u751f\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002"}}

To better capture true user satisfaction and business value, net conversion rate (NetCVR), defined as the probability that a clicked item is purchased and not refunded, has been proposed.Unlike CVR, NetCVR prediction involves a more complex multi-stage cascaded delayed feedback process. The two cascaded delays from click to conversion and from conversion to refund have opposite effects, making traditional CVR modeling methods inapplicable. Moreover, the lack of open-source datasets and online continuous training schemes further hinders progress in this area.To address these challenges, we introduce CASCADE (Cascaded Sequences of Conversion and Delayed Refund), the first large-scale open dataset derived from the Taobao app for online continuous NetCVR prediction. Through an in-depth analysis of CASCADE, we identify three key insights: (1) NetCVR exhibits strong temporal dynamics, necessitating online continuous modeling; (2) cascaded modeling of CVR and refund rate outperforms direct NetCVR modeling; and (3) delay time, which correlates with both CVR and refund rate, is an important feature for NetCVR prediction.Based on these insights, we propose TESLA, a continuous NetCVR modeling framework featuring a CVR-refund-rate cascaded architecture, stage-wise debiasing, and a delay-time-aware ranking loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TESLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CASCADE, achieving absolute improvements of 12.41 percent in RI-AUC and 14.94 percent in RI-PRAUC on NetCVR prediction.

Training-free pruning solutions (e.g., EOS-attention based methods) can reduce index vector size by approximately 60% without model adaptation, but often underperform random selection in high-compression scenarios (> 80%). Prior research (e.g., Light-ColPali) attributes this to the conclusion that visual token importance is inherently query-dependent, thereby questioning the feasibility of training-free pruning. In this work, we propose Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP), a training-free pruning method that identifies key visual patches from middle layers to achieve high performance compression. We also introduce Oracle Score Retention (OSR) protocol to evaluate how layer-wise information affects compression efficiency.

To mitigate this issue, unlearnable examples introduce imperceptible perturbations into data, preventing models from learning effectively.

In this work, we propose Perturbation-Induced Linearization (PIL), a computationally efficient yet effective method that generates perturbations using only linear surrogate models. PIL achieves comparable or better performance than existing surrogate-based methods while reducing computational time dramatically. We further reveal a key mechanism underlying unlearnable examples: inducing linearization to deep models, which explains why PIL can achieve competitive results in a very short time.

To facilitate their adoption by language designers, the comprehensibility of the language used to define other languages is an important aspect to evaluate. Moreover, considering that language workbenches are relatively new tools, user acceptance emerges as a crucial factor to be accounted for during their assessment. Current literature often neglects user-centred aspects like comprehensibility and acceptance in the assessment of this breed of tools. This paper addresses this gap through a family of experiments assessing Neverlang, a modular language workbench. The study adopts a tailored version of the Method Evaluation Model (MEM) to evaluate the comprehensibility of Neverlang's meta-language and programs, as well as user acceptance in terms of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. It also investigates the relationships among these dimensions. The experiments were conducted in three iterations involving participants from academia. The results reveal that users demonstrate sufficient comprehension of Neverlang's meta-language, particularly concerning its syntax, express a favourable perception of its usefulness, and indicate their intention to use it. However, the results also indicate that Neverlang's ease of use remains a challenge. Additionally, variations in the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, whether low or high, influence the users' intention to use the tool. Surprisingly, no significant correlation is found between comprehensibility and user acceptance. Notably, higher comprehensibility of the meta-language does not necessarily translate into greater acceptance, underscoring the complex interplay between comprehension and adoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0Neverlang\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5176\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u8ba4\u53ef\u5176\u6709\u7528\u6027\u4e14\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u7528\u6027\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u732e\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\u65f6\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u9762\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u548c\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u7248\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff08MEM\uff09\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u8f6e\u6d89\u53ca\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30Neverlang\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u5bf9Neverlang\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8ba4\u53ef\u5176\u6709\u7528\u6027\u5e76\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u7528\u6027\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u6613\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u7528\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5f71\u54cd\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\uff1b\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4e0e\u91c7\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Basso continuo is not merely a matter of history; moreover, it is a historically inspired living practice, and The Aligned Continuo Dataset (ACoRD) records the first sample of modern-day basso continuo playing in the symbolic domain. This dataset, containing 175 MIDI recordings of 5 basso continuo scores performed by 7 players, allows us to start observing and analyzing the variety that basso continuo improvisation brings. A recently proposed basso continuo performance-to-score alignment system provides a way of mapping improvised performance notes to score notes. In order to study aligned basso continuo performances, we need an appropriate feature representation. We propose griff, a representation inspired by historical basso continuo treatises. It enables us to encode both pitch content and structure of a basso continuo realization in a transposition-invariant way. Griffs are directly extracted from aligned basso continuo performances by grouping together performance notes aligned to the same score note in a onset-time ordered way, and they provide meaningful tokens that form a feature space in which we can analyze basso continuo performance styles. We statistically describe griffs extracted from the ACoRD dataset recordings, and show in two experiments how griffs can be used for statistical analysis of individuality of different players' basso continuo performance styles. We finally present an argument why it is desirable to preserve the structure of a basso continuo improvisation in order to conduct a refined analysis of personal performance styles of individual basso continuo practitioners, and why griffs can provide a meaningful historically informed feature space worthy of a more robust empirical validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdACoRD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bb0\u5f55\u73b0\u4ee3\u901a\u594f\u4f4e\u97f3\u6f14\u594f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fagriff\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u6f14\u594f\u98ce\u683c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4fdd\u7559\u5373\u5174\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u4e2a\u4eba\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u901a\u594f\u4f4e\u97f3\u6f14\u594f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6f14\u594f\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u5386\u53f2\u901a\u594f\u4f4e\u97f3\u8bba\u8457\u542f\u53d1\u7684griff\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6f14\u594f\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6griff\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u6f14\u594f\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u4f7f\u7528griff\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6f14\u594f\u8005\u7684\u901a\u594f\u4f4e\u97f3\u6f14\u594f\u98ce\u683c\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u594f\u4f4e\u97f3\u5373\u5174\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e2a\u4eba\u6f14\u594f\u98ce\u683c\u5f88\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\uff0cgriff\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning.

Based on this ansatz, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become a popular method for decomposing embeddings into a sparse combination of linear directions, which have been shown empirically to often correspond to human-interpretable semantics. However, recent attempts to apply SAEs to multimodal embedding spaces (such as the popular CLIP embeddings for image/text data) have found that SAEs often learn \"split dictionaries\", where most of the learned sparse features are essentially unimodal, active only for data of a single modality. In this work, we study how to effectively adapt SAEs for the setting of multimodal embeddings while ensuring multimodal alignment. We first argue that the existence of a split dictionary decomposition on an aligned embedding space implies the existence of a non-split dictionary with improved modality alignment. Then, we propose a new SAE-based approach to multimodal embedding decomposition using cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization. We apply our method to popular embeddings for image/text (CLIP) and audio/text (CLAP) data and show that, compared to standard SAEs, our approach learns a more multimodal dictionary while reducing the number of dead neurons and improving feature semanticity. We finally demonstrate how this improvement in alignment of concepts between modalities can enable improvements in the interpretability and control of cross-modal tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u6574\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5728\u56fe\u50cf/\u6587\u672c\u548c\u97f3\u9891/\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b57\u5178\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SAEs\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\u201c\u5206\u88c2\u5b57\u5178\u201d\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u6574SAEs\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eSAEs\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u7ec4\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6SAEs\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b57\u5178\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6b7b\u4ea1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we study rectified flow models, which constrain transport trajectories to be linear from the base distribution to the data distribution. This structural restriction greatly accelerates sampling, often enabling high-quality generation with a single Euler step. Under standard assumptions on the neural network classes used to parameterize the velocity field and data distribution, we prove that rectified flows achieve sample complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$. This improves on the best known $O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$ bounds for flow matching model and matches the optimal rate for mean estimation. Our analysis exploits the particular structure of rectified flows: because the model is trained with a squared loss along linear paths, the associated hypothesis class admits a sharply controlled localized Rademacher complexity. This yields the improved, order-optimal sample complexity and provides a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of rectified flow models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

StructuralCFN explicitly models each feature as a mathematical composition of its counterparts through Differentiable Adaptive Gating, which automatically discovers the optimal activation physics (e.g., attention-style filtering vs. inhibitory polarity) for each relationship. Our framework enables Structured Knowledge Integration, allowing domain-specific relational priors to be injected directly into the architecture to guide discovery. We evaluate StructuralCFN across a rigorous 10-fold cross-validation suite on 18 benchmarks, demonstrating statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) on scientific and clinical datasets (e.g., Blood Transfusion, Ozone, WDBC). Furthermore, StructuralCFN provides Intrinsic Symbolic Interpretability: it recovers the governing \"laws\" of the data manifold as human-readable mathematical expressions while maintaining a compact parameter footprint (300--2,500 parameters) that is over an order of magnitude (10x--20x) smaller than standard deep baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faStructuralCFN\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u4e14\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u672a\u5229\u7528\u8868\u683c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStructuralCFN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u65bd\u52a0\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u572818\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u768410\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff08p < 0.05\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "StructuralCFN\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u6709\u5185\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\u5c0f\u51e0\u5341\u500d\u3002"}}

Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.\n  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of \"VCW as transitional framework.\" Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.\n  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes.

However, large codebases can make this reporting challenging. This paper employs an empirical approach to understand developers' experience with Google Play Store's Data Safety Section (DSS) form.\n  We first survey 41 Android developers to understand how they categorize privacy-related data into DSS categories and how confident they feel when completing the DSS form. To gain a broader and more detailed view of the challenges developers encounter during the process, we complement the survey with an analysis of 172 online developer discussions, capturing the perspectives of 642 additional developers. Together, these two data sources represent insights from 683 developers.\n  Our findings reveal that developers often manually classify the privacy-related data their apps collect into the data categories defined by Google-or, in some cases, omit classification entirely-and rely heavily on existing online resources when completing the form.

However, deploying RAG on edge devices faces efficiency hurdles due to the rapid growth of profile data, such as user-LLM interactions and recent updates. While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions.

However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement.

Elevator builds hub-based topologies in a fully decentralized manner, randomly selecting hubs among participating nodes. These hubs, acting as central nodes connected to the entire network, can be leveraged to accelerate message dissemination. Simulation results have shown that Elevator converges rapidly (within 3--4 cycles) and exhibits robustness against crash failures and churn. However, its resilience to Byzantine adversaries has not been investigated. In this work, we provide the first evaluation of Elevator under Byzantine adversaries and show that even a small fraction (2%) of Byzantine nodes is sufficient to subvert the network.

In contrast, LIFT withstands adversarial infiltration and remains robust with up to 10% Byzantine nodes.

However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data.

Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns.

In this work, we developed and externally validated a visit-level 180-day mortality risk model using longitudinal data from two Phase III cohorts (n=526 and n=640). Only visits with observable 180-day outcomes were labeled; right-censored cases were excluded from analysis. We compared five candidate architectures: Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest (RSF), and Logistic Regression. For each dataset, we selected the smallest risk-threshold that achieved an 85% sensitivity floor. The GRU and RSF models showed high discrimination capabilities initially (C-index: 87% for both). In external validation, the GRU obtained a higher calibration (slope: 0.93; intercept: 0.07) and achieved an PR-AUC of 0.87. Clinical impact analysis showed a median time-in-warning of 151.0 days for true positives (59.0 days for false positives) and 18.3 alerts per 100 patient-visits. Given late-stage frailty or cachexia and hemodynamic instability, permutation importance ranked BMI and systolic blood pressure as the strongest associations.

While state-of-the-art gossip-based methods satisfy the first requirement, achieving robustness remains challenging. Asynchronous decentralized ADMM-based methods have been explored for estimating the median, a statistical centrality measure that is notoriously more robust than the mean. However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node. We analyze a synchronous variant of AsylADMM to establish theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate fast convergence for the asynchronous algorithm. We then show that our algorithm enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, with quantile-based trimming empirically outperforming existing rank-based methods.

We propose step-ahead partial error feedback (SA-PEF), which integrates step-ahead (SA) correction with partial error feedback (PEF). SA-PEF recovers EF when the step-ahead coefficient $\u03b1=0$ and step-ahead EF (SAEF) when $\u03b1=1$. For non-convex objectives and $\u03b4$-contractive compressors, we establish a second-moment bound and a residual recursion that guarantee convergence to stationarity under heterogeneous data and partial client participation. The resulting rates match standard non-convex Fed-SGD guarantees up to constant factors, achieving $O((\u03b7,\u03b7_0TR)^{-1})$ convergence to a variance/heterogeneity floor with a fixed inner step size.

Unlike general-purpose engines such as ONNX Runtime, today's LLM inference systems offer little operator-level visibility, leaving developers blind to where time and resources go. Even basic questions -- is this workload memory-bound or compute-bound? -- often remain unanswered. To close this gap, we develop a fine-grained, non-intrusive profiling framework for modern LLM inference engines, exemplified by llama.cpp but applicable to similar runtime architectures. Built on extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology, our system dynamically attaches probes to runtime functions across multiple layers -- without modifying or recompiling the source. It transforms collected traces into rich visualizations of operators, graphs, timelines, and hardware counter trends, exposing how dense inference, Mixture-of-Experts routing, and operator offloading behave in practice. With less than 4% runtime overhead and high profiling fidelity, our framework makes LLM inference both transparent and diagnosable, turning performance profiling into a practical tool for optimization, scheduling, and resource-aware deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53bb\u5411\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u4e5f\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u7b54\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u4f2f\u514b\u5229\u6570\u636e\u5305\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff08eBPF\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5728\u591a\u5c42\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u9644\u52a0\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u8bd1\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e30\u5bcc\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u4e8e4%\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u4f7f\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u6210\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by integrating external knowledge, yet retrieval models often miss relevant context, and generation models hallucinate with irrelevant data. We propose Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) for semantic representation and fine-grained retrieval of code and text. Our approach enhances retrieval precision through tree pruning and mitigates hallucinations via a re-ranking mechanism that integrates non-RAG solutions. Structuring external data into finer-grained nodes improves retrieval granularity. Evaluations on HumanEval and MBPP show up to 20% pass@1 accuracy gains and a 34% improvement over baselines on MBPP. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed PKG approach along with re-ranker effectively address complex problems while maintaining minimal negative impact on solutions that are already correct without RAG.

However, existing approaches, such as MAGE, struggle in stochastic or noisy environments, limiting their applicability. In this work, we address these limitations by extending distributional reinforcement learning on continuous state-action spaces to model not only the distribution over scalar state-action value functions but also over their gradients. We refer to this approach as Distributional Sobolev Training. Inspired by Stochastic Value Gradients (SVG), our method utilizes a one-step world model of reward and transition distributions implemented via a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE). The proposed framework is sample-based and employs Max-sliced Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MSMMD) to instantiate the distributional Bellman operator. We prove that the Sobolev-augmented Bellman operator is a contraction with a unique fixed point, and highlight a fundamental smoothness trade-off underlying contraction in gradient-aware RL.

Although this compositional paradigm has shown superior performance in domains such as reasoning, planning, and verification, its deployment remains challenging due to severe inefficiencies in symbolic and probabilistic inference. Through systematic analysis of representative neuro-symbolic workloads, we identify probabilistic logical reasoning as the inefficiency bottleneck, characterized by irregular control flow, low arithmetic intensity, uncoalesced memory accesses, and poor hardware utilization on CPUs and GPUs.\n  This paper presents REASON, an integrated acceleration framework for probabilistic logical reasoning in neuro-symbolic AI. REASON introduces a unified directed acyclic graph representation that captures common structure across symbolic and probabilistic models, coupled with adaptive pruning and regularization. At the architecture level, REASON features a reconfigurable, tree-based processing fabric optimized for irregular traversal, symbolic deduction, and probabilistic aggregation. At the system level, REASON is tightly integrated with GPU streaming multiprocessors through a programmable interface and multi-level pipeline that efficiently orchestrates compositional execution. Evaluated across six neuro-symbolic workloads, REASON achieves 12-50x speedup and 310-681x energy efficiency over desktop and edge GPUs under TSMC 28 nm node. REASON enables real-time probabilistic logical reasoning, completing end-to-end tasks in 0.8 s with 6 mm2 area and 2.12 W power, demonstrating that targeted acceleration of probabilistic logical reasoning is critical for practical and scalable neuro-symbolic AI and positioning REASON as a foundational system architecture for next-generation cognitive intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6REASON\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u5f88\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u867d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6982\u7387\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREASON\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u684c\u9762\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18GPU\uff0cREASON\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8612 - 50\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u548c310 - 681\u500d\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u57280.8\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u52a0\u901f\u6982\u7387\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u5b9e\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cREASON\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u8ba4\u77e5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

While many frameworks and systems for producing synthetic multi-turn tool calling data have been proposed, prior works have frequently assumed that any tool calling interactions will take place in an execution environment that maintains state. When such an environment is available, this is advantageous as it allows for the validity of an interaction to be determined by whether or not the state of the execution environment matches to some prespecified objective. Unfortunately, this does not hold in many real-world tool use settings, e.g., in enterprise settings where data security is of the utmost importance or in cases where tool specifications are synthesized from multiple sources. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a data generation method, DiGiT-TC, that is designed to produce tool calling conversations that have the characteristics of conversations generated through search in a stateful environment. The key to our technique lies in a novel generation pattern that allows our approach to implicitly represent certain tool calls in the user request. We validate our approach on standard tool calling benchmarks and demonstrate that, even in stateful problem settings, our approach results in strong performance gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5DiGiT - TC\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u6b64\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u586b\u8865\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5DiGiT - TC\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u67d0\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "DiGiT - TC\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u73af\u5883\u641c\u7d22\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In prior work, we developed a design optimization framework that incorporates techno-economic considerations through surrogate modeling and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, focusing solely on minimizing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by using a bottom-up cost estimation approach. In this study, we extend that framework to a multi-objective optimization that uses the Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning (PEARL) algorithm. The objectives include minimizing both the rod-integrated peaking factor ($F_{\u0394h}$) and LCOE -- subject to safety and operational constraints. We evaluate three cost scenarios: (1) a high-cost axial and drum reflectors, (2) a low-cost axial reflector, and (3) low-cost axial and drum reflectors. Our findings indicate that reducing the solid moderator radius, pin pitch, and drum coating angle -- all while increasing the fuel height -- effectively lowers $F_{\u0394h}$. Across all three scenarios, four key strategies consistently emerged for optimizing LCOE: (1) minimizing the axial reflector contribution when costly, (2) reducing control drum reliance, (3) substituting expensive tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel with axial reflector material priced at the level of graphite, and (4) maximizing fuel burnup.

Our system utilizes two key innovations: Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and a Candidates Crossover algorithm. The sequential refinement process is demonstrated as an efficient method that allows the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, enabling it to look back at current progress, reason about the research plan, and intelligently make changes at runtime. This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, our Deep Researcher was evaluated on the DeepResearch Bench, a globally recognized benchmark of 100 doctoral level research tasks. Our architecture achieved an overall score of 46.21, demonstrating superior performance by surpassing leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher, Nvidia AIQ Research Assistant, Perplexity Research, Kimi Researcher and Grok Deeper Search present on the DeepResearch Bench actively running leaderboard.

While their use in high-level synthesis (HLS) remains comparatively less mature, the ratio of HLS- to RTL-focused studies has shifted from 1:10 to 2:10 in the past six months, indicating growing interest in leveraging LLMs for high-level design entry while relying on downstream synthesis for optimization. This growing trend highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation framework dedicated to LLM-based HLS. To address this, We present Bench4HLS for evaluating LLM-generated HLS designs. Bench4HLS comprises 170 manually drafted and validated case studies, spanning small kernels to complex accelerators, curated from widely used public repositories.

Inspired by this, we explore training an autoregressive transformer for in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). In this setting, we initially train a transformer on an offline dataset consisting of trajectories collected from various RL tasks, and then fix and use this transformer to create an action policy for new RL tasks. Notably, we consider the setting where the offline dataset contains trajectories sampled from suboptimal behavioral policies. In this case, standard autoregressive training corresponds to imitation learning and results in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Decision Importance Transformer(DIT) framework, which emulates the actor-critic algorithm in an in-context manner. In particular, we first train a transformer-based value function that estimates the advantage functions of the behavior policies that collected the suboptimal trajectories. Then we train a transformer-based policy via a weighted maximum likelihood estimation loss, where the weights are constructed based on the trained value function to steer the suboptimal policies to the optimal ones. We conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of DIT on both bandit and Markov Decision Process problems.

While these capabilities are fundamentally acquired during the mid-training phase and subsequently elicited during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), there remains a critical deficit in metrics capable of guiding mid-training effectively. Standard metrics such as Perplexity (PPL) are compromised by the \"Long-Context Tax\" and exhibit weak correlation with downstream SWE performance. In this paper, we bridge this gap by first introducing a rigorous data filtering strategy. Crucially, we propose the Entropy Compression Hypothesis, redefining intelligence not by scalar Top-1 compression, but by the capacity to structure uncertainty into Entropy-Compressed States of low orders (\"reasonable hesitation\"). Grounded in this fine-grained entropy analysis, we formulate a novel metric, HE-SNR (High-Entropy Signal-to-Noise Ratio).

The model provides two built-in inference methods: maximum a posteriori estimation using the L-BFGS-B algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling via the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). While exploring various time-series forecasting problems using Bayesian inference with Prophet, we encountered limitations stemming from the inability to apply alternative inference techniques beyond those provided by default. Additionally, the fluent API design of Facebook Prophet proved insufficiently flexible for implementing our custom modeling ideas. To address these shortcomings, we developed a complete reimplementation of the Prophet model in PyMC, which enables us to extend the base model and evaluate and compare multiple Bayesian inference methods. In this paper, we present our PyMC-based implementation and analyze in detail the implementation of different Bayesian inference techniques. We consider full MCMC techniques, MAP estimation and Variational inference techniques on a time-series forecasting problem. We discuss in details the sampling approach, convergence diagnostics, forecasting metrics as well as their computational efficiency and detect possible issues which will be addressed in our future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9Facebook Prophet\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u548cAPI\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5728PyMC\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Prophet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "Facebook Prophet\u9ed8\u8ba4\u63a8\u65ad\u6280\u672f\u6709\u9650\u4e14API\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5728PyMC\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0Prophet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u91c7\u7528\u5168MCMC\u6280\u672f\u3001MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u6280\u672f\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6536\u655b\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728PyMC\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0Prophet\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5c06\u5728\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u3002"}}

Yet their susceptibility to privacy leakage via Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) remains critically underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of MIA vulnerabilities in DLMs. Unlike the autoregressive models' single fixed prediction pattern, DLMs' multiple maskable configurations exponentially increase attack opportunities. This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism. Experiments on nine datasets show SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over the best baseline, with up to 8 times improvement at low false positive rates. These findings reveal significant, previously unknown vulnerabilities in DLMs, necessitating the development of tailored privacy defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLMs\uff09\u5728\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIA\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSAMA\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63ed\u793aDLMs\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "DLMs\u5728MIA\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5bf9\u5176MIA\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SAMA\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u5b50\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u9006\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSAMA\u76f8\u5bf9\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8630%\u7684AUC\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DLMs\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u6b64\u524d\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

Yet the cost and complexity of training has kept this advantage theoretical. We show it is now practical. We present Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents (SERA), an efficient method for training coding agents that enables the rapid and cheap creation of agents specialized to private codebases. Using only supervised finetuning (SFT), SERA achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open-source (open data, method, code) models while matching the performance of frontier open-weight models like Devstral-Small-2. Creating SERA models is 26x cheaper than reinforcement learning and 57x cheaper than previous synthetic data methods to reach equivalent performance. Our method, Soft Verified Generation (SVG), generates thousands of trajectories from a single code repository. Combined with cost-efficiency, this enables specialization to private codebases. Beyond repository specialization, we apply SVG to a larger corpus of codebases, generating over 200,000 synthetic trajectories.

To evaluate long-horizon generation, we introduce three task-matched tests: (i) on-manifold stability via generated-only drift compared to the time-resolved distribution of real sliding windows, and (ii) conditional specificity via correct context versus prompt-swap controls using a neurophysiologically grounded metric set. We train on CamCAN and Omega and run all analyses on held-out MOUS, establishing cross-dataset generalization.

In contrast, systematic analysis of modern large-scale LLMs remains limited, despite their rapid adoption in diverse application scenarios.

Specifically, SSL extracts the representation from massive unlabeled data, which will be transferred to a plenty of down streaming tasks with limited data. The significant improvement on diverse applications of representation learning has attracted increasing attention, resulting in a variety of dramatically different self-supervised learning objectives for representation extraction, with an assortment of learning procedures, but the lack of a clear and unified understanding. Such an absence hampers the ongoing development of representation learning, leaving a theoretical understanding missing, principles for efficient algorithm design unclear, and the use of representation learning methods in practice unjustified. The urgency for a unified framework is further motivated by the rapid growth in representation learning methods. In this paper, we are therefore compelled to develop a principled foundation of representation learning. We first theoretically investigate the sufficiency of the representation from a spectral representation view, which reveals the spectral essence of the existing successful SSL algorithms and paves the path to a unified framework for understanding and analysis.

However, ML and CL constraints add an extra layer of complexity to the clustering problem, with current methods struggling in data scalability, especially in niche applications like quantum or quantum-hybrid clustering. We propose PASS, a pairwise-constraints and ambiguity-driven subset selection framework that preserves ML and CL constraints satisfaction while allowing scalable, high-quality clustering solution. PASS collapses ML constraints into pseudo-points and offers two selectors: a constraint-aware margin rule that collects near-boundary points and all detected CL violations, and an information-geometric rule that scores points via a Fisher-Rao distance derived from soft assignment posteriors, then selects the highest-information subset under a simple budget. Across diverse benchmarks, PASS attains competitive SSE at substantially lower cost than exact or penalty-based methods, and remains effective in regimes where prior approaches fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPASS\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6216\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u7b49\u7ec6\u5206\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPASS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06ML\u7ea6\u675f\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f2a\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u89c4\u5219\u4e24\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPASS\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684SSE\uff0c\u5728\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "PASS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6210\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models. Across models, we find that the generated rhyme (e.g. \"-ight\") or answer to a question (\"whale\") can be manipulated by steering at the end of the preceding line with a vector, affecting the generation of intermediate tokens leading up to the rhyme or answer word. We show that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present in smaller models than previously thought, starting from 1B parameters.

However, this process lacks theoretical justification. This paper fills the gap by developing a local duality theory for such an SSVM formulation and exploring its relationship with the hinge-loss SVM (hSVM) and the ramp-loss SVM (rSVM). In particular, we prove that the derived SSVM is exactly the dual problem of the 0/1-loss SVM, and the linear representer theorem holds for their local solutions. The local solution of SSVM also provides guidelines on selecting hyperparameters of hSVM and rSVM. {Under specific conditions, we show that a sequence of global solutions of hSVM converges to a local solution of 0/1-loss SVM. Moreover, a local minimizer of 0/1-loss SVM is a local minimizer of rSVM.} This explains why a local solution induced by SSVM outperforms hSVM and rSVM in the prior empirical study.

Studies show that, under homogeneous agents and uniform belief updates, debate preserves expected correctness and therefore cannot reliably improve outcomes. Drawing on findings from human deliberation and collective decision-making, we identify two key mechanisms missing from vanilla MAD: (i) diversity of initial viewpoints and (ii) explicit, calibrated confidence communication. We propose two lightweight interventions. First, a diversity-aware initialisation that selects a more diverse pool of candidate answers, increasing the likelihood that a correct hypothesis is present at the start of debate. Second, a confidence-modulated debate protocol in which agents express calibrated confidence and condition their updates on others' confidence. We show theoretically that diversity-aware initialisation improves the prior probability of MAD success without changing the underlying update dynamics, while confidence-modulated updates enable debate to systematically drift to the correct hypothesis. Empirically, across six reasoning-oriented QA benchmarks, our methods consistently outperform vanilla MAD and majority vote.

Despite rapid progress in language models, we still lack a clear way to understand how their abilities in these interpersonal domains compare to those of humans. We introduce HEART, the first-ever framework that directly compares humans and LLMs on the same multi-turn emotional-support conversations. For each dialogue history, we pair human and model responses and evaluate them through blinded human raters and an ensemble of LLM-as-judge evaluators. All assessments follow a rubric grounded in interpersonal communication science across five dimensions: Human Alignment, Empathic Responsiveness, Attunement, Resonance, and Task-Following. HEART uncovers striking behavioral patterns. Several frontier models approach or surpass the average human responses in perceived empathy and consistency. At the same time, humans maintain advantages in adaptive reframing, tension-naming, and nuanced tone shifts, particularly in adversarial turns. Human and LLM-as-judge preferences align on about 80 percent of pairwise comparisons, matching inter-human agreement, and their written rationales emphasize similar HEART dimensions. This pattern suggests an emerging convergence in the criteria used to assess supportive quality. By placing humans and models on equal footing, HEART reframes supportive dialogue as a distinct capability axis, separable from general reasoning or linguistic fluency. It provides a unified empirical foundation for understanding where model-generated support aligns with human social judgment, where it diverges, and how affective conversational competence scales with model size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHEART\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u6709\u8d8b\u540c\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u8fdb\u6b65\u5feb\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4eba\u9645\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165HEART\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u590d\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f2\u6d4b\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u96c6\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6309\u4eba\u9645\u6c9f\u901a\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u90e8\u5206\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5171\u60c5\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u56de\u5408\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe80%\u3002", "conclusion": "HEART\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u652f\u6301\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u80fd\u529b\u8f74\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5f02\u540c\u53ca\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Such techniques usually involve solving large, sparse linear systems, where preconditioning methods are critical. In recent years, neural methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have demonstrated their potential through accelerated convergence. Nonetheless, to extract connective structures, existing techniques aggregate discretized system matrices into graphs, and suffer from rank inflation and a suboptimal convergence rate.

However, the boundaries of their capabilities in automated formulation and problem solving remain poorly understood, particularly when extending to complex, real-world tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose OPT-ENGINE, an extensible benchmark framework designed to evaluate LLMs on optimization modeling with controllable and scalable difficulty levels. OPT-ENGINE spans 10 canonical tasks across operations research, with five Linear Programming and five Mixed-Integer Programming. Utilizing OPT-ENGINE, we conduct an extensive study of LLMs' reasoning capabilities, addressing two critical questions: 1.) Do LLMs' performance remain robust when generalizing to out-of-distribution optimization tasks that scale in complexity beyond current benchmark levels? and 2.) At what stage, from problem interpretation to solution generation, do current LLMs encounter the most significant bottlenecks? Our empirical results yield two key insights: first, tool-integrated reasoning with external solvers exhibits significantly higher robustness as task complexity escalates, while pure-text reasoning reaches a ceiling; second, the automated formulation of constraints constitutes the primary performance bottleneck. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing next-generation LLMs for advanced optimization.

To explore LLM's potential in assisting scientific review, this study examined ChatGPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5's consistency and reliability in evaluating abstracts compared to one another and to human reviewers. Methods: 160 abstracts from a local conference were graded by human reviewers and three LLMs using one rubric. Composite score distributions across three LLMs and fourteen reviewers were examined. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for within-AI reliability and AI-human concordance. Bland-Altman plots were examined for visual agreement patterns and systematic bias. Results: LLMs achieved good-to-excellent agreement with each other (ICCs: 0.59-0.87). ChatGPT and Claude reached moderate agreement with human reviewers on overall quality and content-specific criteria, with ICCs ~.45-.60 for composite, impression, clarity, objective, and results. They exhibited fair agreement on subjective dimensions, with ICC ranging from 0.23-0.38 for impact, engagement, and applicability. Gemini showed fair agreement on half criteria and no reliability on impact and applicability. Three LLMs showed acceptable or negligible mean difference (ChatGPT=0.24, Gemini=0.42, Claude=-0.02) from the human mean composite scores. Discussion: LLMs could process abstracts in batches with moderate agreement with human experts on overall quality and objective criteria. With appropriate process architecture, they can apply a rubric consistently across volumes of abstracts exceeding feasibility for a human rater. The weaker performance on subjective dimensions indicates that AI should serve a complementary role in evaluation, while human expertise remains essential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4ChatGPT - 5\u3001Gemini - 3 - Pro\u548cClaude - Sonnet - 4.5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6458\u8981\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u79d1\u5b66\u8bc4\u5ba1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u590d\u6742\u5b66\u672f\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u8ba9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9160\u7bc7\u6458\u8981\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7c7b\u5185\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u7528Bland - Altman\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u4e92\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u826f\u597d\u5230\u4f18\u79c0\uff1bChatGPT\u548cClaude\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u7279\u5b9a\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e2d\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u516c\u5e73\u4e00\u81f4\uff1bGemini\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u516c\u5e73\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e73\u5747\u7efc\u5408\u5f97\u5206\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6279\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u6709\u4e2d\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u5f31\uff0c\u5e94\u8d77\u8865\u5145\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ecd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Such methods aim to maximize a conditional output distribution aligned with higher rewards whilst not drifting far from a pretrained prior. This is commonly enforced by KL (Kullback Leibler) regularization. As such, a central issue still remains: how does one choose the right regularization strength? Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to \"reward hacking\". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control. Our experiments show that across multiple text image alignment and image-quality metrics, our method consistently provides a strong approximation for models aligned entirely from scratch at different regularization strengths. Thus, our method yields an efficient way to search for the optimal strength, eliminating the need for expensive alignment sweeps and thereby substantially reducing computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdDeRaDiff\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0d\u540c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DeRaDiff\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u540e\u9a8c\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6df7\u5408\u66ff\u4ee3\u53cd\u5411\u6b65\u9aa4\u53c2\u8003\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "DeRaDiff\u662f\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

However, sparse MoEs add complexity to training due to (i) new trainable parameters (router weights) that, like all other parameter groups, require hyperparameter (HP) tuning; (ii) new architecture scale dimensions (number of and size of experts) that must be chosen and potentially taken large. To make HP selection cheap and reliable, we propose a new parameterization for transformer models with MoE layers when scaling model width, depth, number of experts, and expert (hidden) size.

To address this, we propose \\textbf{Spark} (\\textbf{S}trategic \\textbf{P}olicy-\\textbf{A}ware explo\\textbf{R}ation via \\textbf{K}ey-state dynamic branching), a novel framework that selectively branches at critical decision states for resource-efficient exploration. Our key insight is to activate adaptive branching exploration at critical decision points to probe promising trajectories, thereby achieving precise resource allocation that prioritizes sampling quality over blind coverage. This design leverages the agent's intrinsic decision-making signals to reduce dependence on human priors, enabling the agent to autonomously expand exploration and achieve stronger generalization.

In practice, identical prompts do not always produce identical outputs, even when temperature and other decoding parameters are fixed. In this work, we conduct repeated-run experiments to empirically quantify baseline behavioural drift, defined as output variability observed when the same prompt is issued multiple times under operator-free conditions. We evaluate two publicly accessible models, gpt-4o-mini and llama3.1-8b, across five prompt categories using exact repeats, perturbed inputs, and reuse modes at temperatures of 0.0 and 0.7. Drift is measured using unique output fractions, lexical similarity, and word count statistics, enabling direct comparison across models, prompting modes, and deployment types. The results show that nondeterminism persists even at temperature 0.0, with distinct variability patterns by model size, deployment, and prompt type. We situate these findings within existing work on concept drift, behavioural drift, and infrastructure-induced nondeterminism, discuss the limitations of lexical metrics, and highlight emerging semantic approaches.

The identity shows that for globally calibrated models, the weighted sums of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance across groups is equal to a \"total unfairness budget.\" For binary outcomes, this budget is the model's mean-squared error times the difference in group prevalence across outcome classes. The identity nests standard impossibility results as special cases, while also describing inherent tradeoffs when one or more fairness measures are not perfectly satisfied. The results suggest that accuracy and fairness are best viewed as complements in binary prediction tasks: increasing accuracy necessarily shrinks the total unfairness budget and vice-versa. Experiments on benchmark data confirm the theory and show that many fairness interventions largely substitute between fairness violations, and when they reduce accuracy they tend to expand the total unfairness budget. The results extend naturally to prediction tasks with non-binary outcomes, illustrating how additional outcome information can relax fairness incompatibilities and identifying conditions under which the binary-style impossibility does and does not extend to regression tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a8\u5bfc\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u8ba1\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4f1a\u8ba1\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u4f1a\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8fdd\u89c4\u95f4\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f1a\u6269\u5927\u603b\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u9884\u7b97\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u662f\u4e92\u8865\u7684\uff1b\u989d\u5916\u7ed3\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u3002"}}

These models generate synthetic daily scenarios of individual buy and sell orders, which, once aggregated, yield hourly supply and demand curves.

Recently, deep generative models offer powerful data-driven priors for such inverse problems, yet existing methods struggle to enforce hard physical constraints without costly retraining or disrupting the learned generative prior. Consequently, there is a critical need for a sampling mechanism that can reconcile strict physical consistency and observational fidelity with the statistical structure of the pre-trained prior. To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining. The algorithm employs a rigorous two-step scheme that alternates between: (\\romannumeral1) a terminal optimization step, which projects the flow prediction onto the intersection of the physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization; and (\\romannumeral2) an interpolation step, which maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path. This procedure admits a Bayesian interpretation as a sequence of local maximum a posteriori (MAP) updates.

Since cascaded architectures remain the dominant choice for complex tasks, existing cascaded streaming strategies attempt to reduce this latency via mechanical segmentation (e.g., fixed chunks, VAD-based splitting) or speculative generation, but they frequently either break semantic units or waste computation on predictions that must be rolled back. To address these challenges, we propose LTS-VoiceAgent, a Listen-Think-Speak framework that explicitly separates when to think from how to reason incrementally. It features a Dynamic Semantic Trigger to detect meaningful prefixes, and a Dual-Role Stream Orchestrator that coordinates a background Thinker (for state maintenance) and a foreground Speaker (for speculative solving). This parallel design enables \"thinking while speaking\" without blocking responses. We also introduce a Pause-and-Repair benchmark containing natural disfluencies to stress-test streaming robustness.

We propose $\u03b4$-Adapter, a lightweight, architecture-agnostic way to boost deployed time series forecasters without retraining. $\u03b4$-Adapter learns tiny, bounded modules at two interfaces: input nudging (soft edits to covariates) and output residual correction. We provide local descent guarantees, $O(\u03b4)$ drift bounds, and compositional stability for combined adapters. Meanwhile, it can act as a feature selector by learning a sparse, horizon-aware mask over inputs to select important features, thereby improving interpretability. In addition, it can also be used as a distribution calibrator to measure uncertainty. Thus, we introduce a Quantile Calibrator and a Conformal Corrector that together deliver calibrated, personalized intervals with finite-sample coverage.

This study investigates the memory mechanisms instantiated by attention layers, drawing on prior research in psychology and computational psycholinguistics that links Transformer attention to cue based retrieval in human memory. In this view, queries encode the retrieval context, keys index candidate memory traces, attention weights quantify cue trace similarity, and values carry the encoded content, jointly enabling the construction of a context representation that precedes and facilitates memory retrieval. Guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, we hypothesize that the cues used in the initial stage of retrieval are instantiated as keywords.

Without this capability, an SLM could reveal one user's confidential schedule to another, a privacy failure we term interactional privacy. Thus, the ability to generate speaker-aware responses becomes essential for SLM safe deployment. Current SLM benchmarks test dialogue ability but overlook speaker identity. Multi-speaker benchmarks check who said what without assessing whether SLMs adapt their responses. Privacy benchmarks focus on globally sensitive data (e.g., bank passwords) while neglecting contextual privacy-sensitive information (e.g., a user's private appointment). To address this gap, we introduce VoxPrivacy, the first benchmark designed to evaluate interactional privacy in SLMs. VoxPrivacy spans three tiers of increasing difficulty, from following direct secrecy commands to proactively protecting privacy. Our evaluation of nine SLMs on a 32-hour bilingual dataset reveals a widespread vulnerability: most open-source models perform close to random chance (around 50% accuracy) on conditional privacy decisions, while even strong closed-source systems fall short on proactive privacy inference.

Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u8109\u51b2\u54cd\u5e94\uff08SIR\uff09\u8865\u507f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e3D\u5149\u58f0\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u65ad\u5c42\u6210\u50cf\uff08PACT\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PACT\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6362\u80fd\u5668SIR\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f71\u54cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u51c6\u786e\u5feb\u901f\u76843D PACT\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u6570\u636e\u57df\u5efa\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u578bSIR\u8865\u507f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06SIR\u635f\u574f\u7684PACT\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7406\u60f3\u70b9\u6362\u80fd\u5668\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u8865\u507f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76U-Net\u548cDeconv - Net\u4e24\u79cd\u8865\u507f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5feb\u901f\u89e3\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u865a\u62df\u6210\u50cf\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u58f0\u901f\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4f53\u5185\u4e73\u817a\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u88abSIR\u4f2a\u5f71\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u57283D PACT\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u578bSIR\u8865\u507f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u5feb\u901f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This is the camera-ready version. Please refer to the published version for citation once available", "summary": "The prediction objectives of online advertisement ranking models are evolving from probabilistic metrics like conversion rate (CVR) to numerical business metrics like post-click gross merchandise volume (GMV). Unlike the well-studied delayed feedback problem in CVR prediction, delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction remains unexplored and poses greater challenges, as GMV is a continuous target, and a single click can lead to multiple purchases that cumulatively form the label. To bridge the research gap, we establish TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark containing complete transaction sequences rising from each user click, which supports delayed feedback modeling in an online streaming manner. Our analysis and exploratory experiments on TRACE reveal two key insights: (1) the rapid evolution of the GMV label distribution necessitates modeling delayed feedback under online streaming training; (2) the label distribution of repurchase samples substantially differs from that of single-purchase samples, highlighting the need for separate modeling. Motivated by these findings, we propose RepurchasE-Aware Dual-branch prEdictoR (READER), a novel GMV modeling paradigm that selectively activates expert parameters according to repurchase predictions produced by a router. Moreover, READER dynamically calibrates the regression target to mitigate under-estimation caused by incomplete labels. Experimental results show that READER yields superior performance on TRACE over baselines, achieving a 2.19% improvement in terms of accuracy. We believe that our study will open up a new avenue for studying online delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction, and our TRACE benchmark with the gathered insights will facilitate future research and application in this promising direction.

Block-wise diffusion can reduce this cost, yet it typically relies on retraining and constrained update orders, limiting its direct applicability to pretrained DLMs. Our token-level analysis reveals pronounced structural locality in DLM inference. Decoding is driven by a small set of prefix-localized active tokens; the influence of distant undecoded context diminishes rapidly, and decoded tokens exhibit stage-wise temporal stability, enabling reuse of intermediate representations except for a brief post-decode transient. Motivated by these observations, we propose \\textbf{\\placeholder}\\footnote{The source code is available at https://github.com/vhicrgit/Window-Diffusion.}, a window-based token pruning and caching method for inference.

Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing.

We identify and characterize two key failure modes: the multilingual transfer bottleneck (correct language, incorrect task response) and the language consistency bottleneck (correct task response, wrong language). To systematically surface these issues, we design a four-scenario evaluation protocol spanning MMLU, MGSM, and XQuAD benchmarks. To probe these issues with interpretability, we extend logit lens analysis to track language probabilities layer by layer and compute cross-lingual semantic similarity of hidden states. The results reveal a three-phase internal structure: early layers align inputs into a shared semantic space, middle layers perform task reasoning, and late layers drive language-specific generation. Guided by these insights, we introduce selective fine-tuning of only the final layers responsible for language control. On Qwen-3-32B and Bloom-7.1B, this method achieves over 98 percent language consistency across six languages while fine-tuning only 3-5 percent of parameters, without sacrificing task accuracy. Importantly, this result is nearly identical to that of full-scope fine-tuning (for example, above 98 percent language consistency for both methods across all prompt scenarios) but uses a fraction of the computational resources.

Code available at https://github.com/MariiaDrozdova/sudoku_generation", "summary": "Can standard continuous-time generative models represent distributions whose support is an extremely sparse, globally constrained discrete set? We study this question using completed Sudoku grids as a controlled testbed, treating them as a subset of a continuous relaxation space. We train flow-matching and score-based models along a Gaussian probability path and compare deterministic (ODE) sampling, stochastic (SDE) sampling, and DDPM-style discretizations derived from the same continuous-time training. Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6807\u51c6\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u4e3a\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u79bb\u6563\u96c6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u6570\u72ec\u7f51\u683c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6570\u72ec\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6807\u51c6\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u4e3a\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u79bb\u6563\u96c6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u6570\u72ec\u7f51\u683c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u677e\u5f1b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u6cbf\u7740\u9ad8\u65af\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08ODE\uff09\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u968f\u673a\uff08SDE\uff09\u91c7\u6837\u548cDDPM\u98ce\u683c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d41\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6700\u53ef\u9760\uff0cDDPM\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u7956\u5148\u91c7\u6837\u6574\u4f53\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6570\u72ec\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u5178\u6269\u6563/\u6d41\u516c\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u914d\u975e\u96f6\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on a multi-agent Transformer that models normal driving and measures deviations through prediction residuals. A dual evaluation scheme has been proposed to assess both detection stability and physical alignment: Stability is measured using standard ranking metrics in which Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient captures rank agreement and Jaccard index captures the consistency of the top-K selected items; Physical alignment is assessed through correlations with established Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM). Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness: We show that the maximum residual aggregator achieves the highest physical alignment while maintaining stability.

While AI-driven dietary assessment has made strides in recent years, the ill-posed nature of recovering size (portion) information from monocular images for accurate estimation of ``how much did you eat?'' is a pressing challenge. Some 3D reconstruction methods have achieved impressive geometric reconstruction but fail to recover the crucial real-world scale of the reconstructed object, limiting its usage in precision nutrition. In this paper, we bridge the gap between 3D computer vision and digital health by proposing a method that recovers a true-to-scale 3D reconstructed object from a monocular image. Our approach leverages rich visual features extracted from models trained on large-scale datasets to estimate the scale of the reconstructed object. This learned scale enables us to convert single-view 3D reconstructions into true-to-life, physically meaningful models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two publicly available datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving nearly a 30% reduction in mean absolute volume-estimation error, showcasing its potential to enhance the domain of precision nutrition.

However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data.

We present a neurosymbolic framework that combines LLMs with SMT solvers to produce verification-guided answers through iterative refinement. Our approach decomposes LLM outputs into atomic claims, autoformalizes them into first-order logic, and verifies their logical consistency using automated theorem proving. We introduce three key innovations: (1) multi-model consensus via formal semantic equivalence checking to ensure logic-level alignment between candidates, eliminating the syntactic bias of surface-form metrics, (2) semantic routing that directs different claim types to appropriate verification strategies: symbolic solvers for logical claims and LLM ensembles for commonsense reasoning, and (3) precise logical error localization via Minimal Correction Subsets (MCS), which pinpoint the exact subset of claims to revise, transforming binary failure signals into actionable feedback. Our framework classifies claims by their logical status and aggregates multiple verification signals into a unified score with variance-based penalty.

SSMAE introduces a validation-driven gating mechanism that activates pseudo-labeling only after the model achieves reliable, high-confidence predictions that are consistent across both weakly and strongly augmented views of the same image, reducing confirmation bias. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, SSMAE consistently outperforms supervised ViT and fine-tuned MAE, with the largest gains in low-label regimes (+9.24% over ViT on CIFAR-10 with 10% labels).

Such human-AI collective knowledge ecosystems contain feedback loops with both benefits (e.g., faster growth, easier learning) and systemic risks (e.g., quality dilution, skill reduction, model collapse). To understand such phenomena, we propose a minimal, interpretable dynamical model of the co-evolution of archive size, archive quality, model (LLM) skill, aggregate human skill, and query volume. The model captures two content inflows (human, LLM) controlled by a gate on LLM-content admissions, two learning pathways for humans (archive study vs. LLM assistance), and two LLM-training modalities (corpus-driven scaling vs. learning from human feedback). Through numerical experiments, we identify different growth regimes (e.g., healthy growth, inverted flow, inverted learning, oscillations), and show how platform and policy levers (gate strictness, LLM training, human learning pathways) shift the system across regime boundaries. Two domain configurations (PubMed, GitHub and Copilot) illustrate contrasting steady states under different growth rates and moderation norms.

Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem. We implement 12 sparse ConCA variants and demonstrate their ability to extract meaningful concepts across multiple LLMs, offering theory-backed advantages over SAEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u5ff5\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08ConCA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7a00\u758fConCA\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u4ece\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u6570\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u51faConCA\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7a00\u758fConCA\u53d8\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u6df7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b012\u4e2a\u7a00\u758fConCA\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "ConCA\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u53d8\u4f53\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eSAEs\u3002"}}

Toxic behaviors -- like insults or threats of violence, are widespread in online communities. Strategies to deal with toxic behavior are typically punitive, such as removing content or banning users. Rehabilitative approaches are rarely attempted, in part due to the emotional and psychological cost of engaging with aggressive users. In collaboration with seven large Reddit communities, we conducted a large-scale field experiment (N=893) to invite people who had recently posted toxic content to participate in conversations with AI chatbots. A qualitative analysis of the conversations shows that many participants engaged in good faith and even expressed remorse or a desire to change.

As GPUs continue improving to satisfy ever-increasing performance demands, analyzing past and current progress becomes paramount in determining future constraints on scientific research. This is particularly compelling in the AI domain, where rapid technological advancements and fierce global competition have led the United States to recently implement export control regulations limiting international access to advanced AI chips. For this reason, this paper studies technical progress in NVIDIA datacenter GPUs released from the mid-2000s until today. Specifically, we compile a comprehensive dataset of datacenter NVIDIA GPUs comprising several features, ranging from computational performance to release price. Then, we examine trends in main GPU features and estimate progress indicators for per-memory bandwidth, per-dollar, and per-watt increase rates. Our main results identify doubling times of 1.44 and 1.69 years for FP16 and FP32 operations (without accounting for sparsity benefits), while FP64 doubling times range from 2.06 to 3.79 years. Off-chip memory size and bandwidth grew at slower rates than computing performance, doubling every 3.32 to 3.53 years. The release prices of datacenter GPUs have roughly doubled every 5.1 years, while their power consumption has approximately doubled every 16 years. Finally, we quantify the potential implications of current U.S. export control regulations in terms of the potential performance gaps that would result if implementation were assumed to be complete and successful. We find that recently proposed changes to export controls would shrink the potential performance gap from 23.6x to 3.54x.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a762000\u5e74\u4ee3\u4e2d\u671f\u81f3\u4eca\u82f1\u4f1f\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3GPU\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u589e\u957f\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8fd8\u91cf\u5316\u7f8e\u56fd\u51fa\u53e3\u7ba1\u5236\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740GPU\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u5c55\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8fc7\u53bb\u548c\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u5bf9\u786e\u5b9a\u79d1\u7814\u672a\u6765\u9650\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728AI\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b9e\u65bd\u51fa\u53e3\u7ba1\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u82f1\u4f1f\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3GPU\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u82f1\u4f1f\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3GPU\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53d1\u5e03\u4ef7\u683c\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981GPU\u7279\u5f81\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4f30\u7b97\u6bcf\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u6bcf\u7f8e\u5143\u548c\u6bcf\u74e6\u7684\u589e\u957f\u7387\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "FP16\u548cFP32\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7ffb\u500d\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u522b\u4e3a1.44\u5e74\u548c1.69\u5e74\uff0cFP64\u4e3a2.06 - 3.79\u5e74\uff1b\u7247\u5916\u5185\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u589e\u957f\u6162\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6bcf3.32 - 3.53\u5e74\u7ffb\u500d\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3GPU\u53d1\u5e03\u4ef7\u683c\u7ea6\u6bcf5.1\u5e74\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u7ea6\u6bcf16\u5e74\u7ffb\u500d\uff1b\u7f8e\u56fd\u51fa\u53e3\u7ba1\u5236\u65b0\u89c4\u4f1a\u4f7f\u6f5c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece23.6\u500d\u7f29\u5c0f\u52303.54\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u82f1\u4f1f\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3GPU\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u53d1\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u51fa\u53e3\u7ba1\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u79d1\u7814\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff08CFs\uff09\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u516c\u5e73CFs\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f00\u542f\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u540c\u5c5e\u6027\u53ca\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u7528\u6237\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e14\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u4fe1\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\u7684CFs\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301CFs\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u522b\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u542f\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u53ca\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002"}}

We fine-tune and evaluate Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct and Qwen-3-4B-Instruct on the MedMCQA and Hendrycks Math benchmarks using a ternary reward structure ($-1$, r_abs, 1) under varying abstention reward structures. We further study the effect of combining RLVR with supervised fine-tuning strategies that teach abstention prior to reinforcement learning. Our results show that moderate abstention rewards (r_abs $\\approx -0.25$ to 0.3) consistently reduce incorrect responses without severe accuracy degradation on multiple-choice tasks, with larger models exhibiting greater robustness to abstention incentives. On open-ended question answering, we observe limitations due to insufficient exploration, which can be partially mitigated through supervised abstention training.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can encode scans into lower-dimensional latent spaces capturing disease-relevant features. We propose a semi-supervised VAE framework with a flexible similarity regularization term that aligns selected latent variables with clinical or biomarker measures of dementia progression. This allows adapting the similarity metric and supervised variables to specific goals or available data. We demonstrate the approach using PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), guiding the first latent dimension to align with a cognitive score. Using this supervised latent variable, we generate average reconstructions across levels of cognitive impairment. Voxel-wise GLM analysis reveals reduced metabolism in key regions, mainly the hippocampus, and within major Resting State Networks, particularly the Default Mode and Central Executive Networks.

However, progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale and diverse annotated datasets. Although several Bengali sentiment and hate speech datasets are publicly available, most are limited in size or confined to a single domain, such as social media comments. Consequently, these resources are often insufficient for training modern deep learning based models, which require large volumes of heterogeneous data to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we introduce BengaliSent140, a large-scale Bengali binary sentiment dataset constructed by consolidating seven existing Bengali text datasets into a unified corpus. To ensure consistency across sources, heterogeneous annotation schemes are systematically harmonized into a binary sentiment formulation with two classes: Not Hate (0) and Hate (1). The resulting dataset comprises 139,792 unique text samples, including 68,548 hate and 71,244 not-hate instances, yielding a relatively balanced class distribution. By integrating data from multiple sources and domains, BengaliSent140 offers broader linguistic and contextual coverage than existing Bengali sentiment datasets and provides a strong foundation for training and benchmarking deep learning models. Baseline experimental results are also reported to demonstrate the practical usability of the dataset.

Although combinatorial complexes offer a unified topological framework, most existing topological deep learning methods rely on local message passing via attention mechanisms, which incur quadratic complexity and remain low-dimensional, limiting scalability and rank-aware information aggregation in higher-order complexes.We propose Combinatorial Complex Mamba (CCMamba), the first unified mamba-based neural framework for learning on combinatorial complexes. CCMamba reformulates message passing as a selective state-space modeling problem by organizing multi-rank incidence relations into structured sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models. This enables adaptive, directional, and long range information propagation in linear time without self attention. We further establish the theoretical analysis that the expressive power upper-bound of CCMamba message passing is the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman test.

In this preregistered experiment, we test whether large language models (LLMs) can reliably predict these perception gaps worldwide. Using country-level indicators and public opinion data from 125 countries, we benchmark four state-of-the-art LLMs against Gallup World Poll 2021/22 data and statistical regressions. LLMs, particularly Claude, accurately capture public perceptions of others' willingness to contribute financially to climate action (MAE approximately 5 p.p.; r = .77), comparable to statistical models, though performance declines in less digitally connected, lower-GDP countries. Controlled tests show that LLMs capture the key psychological process - social projection with a systematic downward bias - and rely on structured reasoning rather than memorized values. Overall, LLMs provide a rapid tool for assessing perception gaps in climate action, serving as an alternative to costly surveys in resource-rich countries and as a complement in underrepresented populations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u80fd\u5426\u9884\u6d4b\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u884c\u52a8\u89c2\u5ff5\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u80fd\u8f83\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u76f8\u5173\u516c\u4f17\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u867d\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u56fd\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u884c\u52a8\u652f\u6301\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u4f30\u4ed6\u4eba\u652f\u6301\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u89c2\u5ff5\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528125\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6c11\u610f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06\u56db\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u4e0e\u76d6\u6d1b\u666e\u6c11\u610f\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u7edf\u8ba1\u56de\u5f52\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "LLMs\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fClaude\uff09\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eba\u4e3a\u6c14\u5019\u884c\u52a8\u51fa\u8d44\u610f\u613f\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff08MAE\u7ea65\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1br = 0.77\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u8fde\u63a5\u5c11\u3001GDP\u4f4e\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u63a7\u5236\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660eLLMs\u6355\u6349\u5230\u5173\u952e\u5fc3\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f9d\u9760\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u975e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u884c\u52a8\u89c2\u5ff5\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u56fd\u5bb6\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u53ef\u4f5c\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

We introduce PURGE (Policy Unlearning through Relative Group Erasure), a novel method grounded in the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework that formulates unlearning as a verifiable problem. PURGE uses an intrinsic reward signal that penalizes any mention of forbidden concepts, allowing safe and consistent unlearning. Our approach reduces token usage per target by up to a factor of 46 compared with SotA methods, while improving fluency by 5.48 percent and adversarial robustness by 12.02 percent over the base model. On the Real World Knowledge Unlearning (RWKU) benchmark, PURGE achieves 11 percent unlearning effectiveness while preserving 98 percent of original utility. PURGE shows that framing LLM unlearning as a verifiable task, enables more reliable, efficient, and scalable forgetting, suggesting a promising new direction for unlearning research that combines theoretical guarantees, improved safety, and practical deployment efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPURGE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4SotA\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11token\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u5347\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f1a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u654f\u611f\u6216\u53d7\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728GDPR\u548c\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u4e0b\u9762\u4e34\u5408\u89c4\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ece\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5220\u9664\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eGroup Relative Policy Optimization\u6846\u67b6\u7684PURGE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u60e9\u7f5a\u63d0\u53ca\u7981\u6b62\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eSotA\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6bcf\u76ee\u6807\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe46\u500d\u7684token\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u63d0\u9ad85.48%\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u9ad812.02%\uff1b\u5728RWKU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b011%\u7684\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u755998%\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4e3a\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In dense mmWave environments, accurately classifying low-altitude UAVs as either inside authorized or restricted airspaces remains challenging, requiring models that handle complex propagation and signal variability. This paper proposes a deep learning model, referred to as CoBA, which stands for integrated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Attention which leverages Fifth Generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio measurements to classify UAV operations in authorized and restricted airspaces at low altitude. The proposed CoBA model integrates convolutional, bidirectional recurrent, and attention layers to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in UAV radio measurements. To validate the model, a dedicated dataset is collected using the 5G mmWave network at TalTech, with controlled low altitude UAV flights in authorized and restricted scenarios.

We introduce the \"individual receptive field\" to uncover granular structural dependencies, revealing that convolutional layers act as feature extractors that mirror channel-wise attention while exhibiting superior robustness to non-linear fluctuations. Based on these insights, we propose ACFormer, an architecture designed to reconcile the efficiency of linear projections with the non-linear feature-extraction power of convolutions. ACFormer captures fine-grained information through a shared compression module, preserves temporal locality via gated attention, and reconstructs variable-specific temporal patterns using an independent patch expansion layer.

Using noisy, synthetic data from two damped oscillatory systems, we explore the extrapolation capabilities of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the ability of Symbolic Regression (SR) to recover the underlying equations. Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation.

Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach.

Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising results in phishing URL detection. However, their reasoning capabilities that enabled such performance remain underexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Least-to-Most prompting framework for phishing URL detection. In particular, we introduce an \"answer sensitivity\" mechanism that guides Least-to-Most's iterative approach to enhance reasoning and yield higher prediction accuracy. We evaluate our framework using three URL datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing against a one-shot approach and a supervised model. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the one-shot baseline while achieving performance comparable to that of the supervised model, despite requiring significantly less training data. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis highlights how the iterative reasoning enabled by Least-to-Most, and reinforced by our answer sensitivity mechanism, drives these performance gains. Overall, we show that this simple yet powerful prompting strategy consistently outperforms both one-shot and supervised approaches, despite requiring minimal training or few-shot guidance.

To address these limitations, we propose MuRAL-CPD, a novel semi-supervised method that integrates active learning into a multiresolution CPD algorithm. MuRAL-CPD leverages a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition to detect changes across multiple temporal scales and incorporates user feedback to iteratively optimize key hyperparameters.

However, the popular Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) evaluation mostly measures benign span localization. The needle is near-unique, and the haystack is largely irrelevant. We introduce EverMemBench-S (EMB-S), an adversarial NIAH-style benchmark built on a 326M-token MemoryBank. While the full MemoryBank spans 326M tokens for retrieval-based (RAG) evaluation, we evaluate native long-context models only at scales that fit within each model's context window (up to 1M tokens in this work) to ensure a fair comparison. EMB-S pairs queries with collision-tested near-miss hard negatives and gold evidence sets spanning one or more documents, validated via human screening and LLM verification. We also propose a decoupled diagnostic protocol that reports evidence access (document-ID localization) separately from end-to-end QA quality under full-context prompting. This enables consistent diagnosis for both native long-context prompting and retrieval pipelines. Across a reference-corpus ladder from domain-isolated 64K contexts to a globally shared 326M-token environment, we observe a clear reality gap.

However, most practical pipelines stop at supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and fail to reach the reinforcement learning (RL) alignment stage. The main reason is that RL alignment typically requires either expensive human preference annotation or heavy reliance on high-quality reward models with large-scale API usage and ongoing engineering maintenance, both of which are ill-suited to on-premise settings. To bridge this gap, we propose a positive-unlabeled (PU) RL distillation method for on-premise small-model deployment. Without human-labeled preferences or a reward model, our method distills the teacher's preference-optimization capability from black-box generations into a locally trainable student. For each prompt, we query the teacher once to obtain an anchor response, locally sample multiple student candidates, and perform anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce pairwise or listwise preferences, enabling a fully local training loop via direct preference optimization or group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis justifies that the induced preference signal by our method is order-consistent and concentrates on near-optimal candidates, supporting its stability for preference optimization.

This structure is especially common in operations research applications such as inventory control, energy storage, and resource allocation, where exogenous randomness (e.g., demand, arrivals, or prices) drives system behavior. Despite decades of empirical evidence that greedy, exploitation-only methods work remarkably well in these settings, theory has lagged behind: all existing regret guarantees for Exo-MDPs rely on explicit exploration or tabular assumptions. We show that exploration is unnecessary. We propose Pure Exploitation Learning (PEL) and prove the first general finite-sample regret bounds for exploitation-only algorithms in Exo-MDPs. In the tabular case, PEL achieves $\\widetilde{O}(H^2|\u039e|\\sqrt{K})$. For large, continuous endogenous state spaces, we introduce LSVI-PE, a simple linear-approximation method whose regret is polynomial in the feature dimension, exogenous state space, and horizon, independent of the endogenous state and action spaces. Our analysis introduces two new tools: counterfactual trajectories and Bellman-closed feature transport, which together allow greedy policies to have accurate value estimates without optimism. Experiments on synthetic and resource-management tasks show that PEL consistently outperforming baselines. Overall, our results overturn the conventional wisdom that exploration is required, demonstrating that in Exo-MDPs, pure exploitation is enough.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7eaf\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60(PEL)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5916\u751fMDPs\u4e2d\u7eaf\u5229\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aPEL\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7eaf\u5229\u7528\u8db3\u591f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5916\u751fMDPs\u9057\u61be\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\u6216\u8868\u683c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7eaf\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u843d\u540e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPEL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u60c5\u51b5\u5206\u6790\u5176\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff1b\u5bf9\u5927\u8fde\u7eed\u5185\u751f\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u5165LSVI - PE\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u5c01\u95ed\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u8f93\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8868\u683c\u60c5\u51b5PEL\u8fbe\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0cLSVI - PE\u9057\u61be\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7b49\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2dPEL\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u98a0\u8986\u63a2\u7d22\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5916\u751fMDPs\u4e2d\u7eaf\u5229\u7528\u8db3\u591f\u3002"}}

However, its interplay with the compactness requirements of on-device DNN deployments remains less explored. Simply pruning a SAM-trained model can undermine robustness, since flatness in the continuous parameter space does not necessarily translate to robustness under the discrete structural changes induced by pruning. Conversely, applying SAM after pruning may be fundamentally constrained by architectural limitations imposed by an early, robustness-agnostic pruning pattern. To address this gap, we propose Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM), a framework that shifts sharpness-aware learning from parameter perturbations to mask perturbations. By explicitly perturbing pruning masks during training, C-SAM promotes a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure, enabling the discovery of pruning patterns that simultaneously optimize model compactness and robustness to input variations. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C across ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show that C-SAM consistently achieves higher certified robustness than strong baselines, with improvements of up to 42%, while maintaining task accuracy comparable to the corresponding unpruned models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faC - SAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u526a\u679d\u63a9\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SAM\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u7aefDNN\u90e8\u7f72\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u526a\u679d\u6216\u526a\u679d\u540e\u5e94\u7528SAM\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC - SAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9510\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u53c2\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u63a9\u7801\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u6270\u52a8\u526a\u679d\u63a9\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cC - SAM\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe42%\uff0c\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u672a\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "C - SAM\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

From a single RGB image, we recover object-centric three-dimensional geometry via monocular depth estimation to inform volume and extract coarse material semantics using a vision-language model to guide density-related reasoning. These geometry, semantic, and appearance representations are fused through an instance-adaptive gating mechanism, and two physically guided latent factors (volume- and density-related) are predicted through separate regression heads under mass-only supervision.

The limited availability of labeled data for training often constrains the performance of ANN-based Cox models.

Our single-modal Cox-MT models, utilizing TCGA RNA-seq data or whole slide images, significantly outperformed the existing ANN-based Cox model, Cox-nnet, using the same data set across four types of cancer considered. As the number of unlabeled samples increased, the performance of Cox-MT significantly improved with a given set of labeled data.

However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence.

Subsequently, semantic supervision strategy with spatial intelligence is introduced, which integrates the functions of visual perception and spatial reasoning, thus prompting the model to achieve accurate enhancement.

In this work, we introduce Continual GUI Agents, a new task that requires GUI agents to perform continual learning under shifted domains and resolutions. We find existing methods fail to maintain stable grounding as GUI distributions shift over time, due to the diversity of UI interaction points and regions in fluxing scenarios. To address this, we introduce GUI-Anchoring in Flux (GUI-AiF), a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework that stabilizes continual learning through two novel rewards: Anchoring Point Reward in Flux (APR-iF) and Anchoring Region Reward in Flux (ARR-iF).

However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models.

This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are largely restricted to toy tasks and fixed environments, limiting their realism and scalability. To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability. We also propose two new evaluation metrics -- Proportion of Non-Dominated Solutions (PNDS) and Ordering Score (OS) -- that directly capture preference consistency while complementing the widely used hypervolume metric. Through experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and graph-aware models, we show that GraphAllocBench exposes the limitations of existing MORL approaches and paves the way for using graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks in complex, high-dimensional combinatorial allocation tasks. Beyond its predefined problem set, GraphAllocBench enables users to flexibly vary objectives, preferences, and allocation rules, establishing it as a versatile and extensible benchmark for advancing PCPL.

We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models.

In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u76d1\u7763\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4ece\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u7406\u8bba\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5584\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5176\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5047\u8bbe\u5148\u9a8c\u5728Cameron - Martin\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7edd\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\uff0c\u7528Doob\u7684h\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u65e0\u7a77\u7ef4\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u96be\u89e3\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u9879\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u503c\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u4ece\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While new online benchmarks offer more realistic testing than offline ones, they tend to focus on the agents' task instruction-following ability while neglecting their reasoning and exploration ability. Moreover, these benchmarks do not consider the random noise in real-world mobile environments. This leads to a gap between benchmarks and real-world environments. To addressing these limitations, we propose MobileBench-OL, an online benchmark with 1080 tasks from 80 Chinese apps. It measures task execution, complex reasoning, and noise robustness of agents by including 5 subsets, which set multiple evaluation dimensions. We also provide an auto-eval framework with a reset mechanism, enabling stable and repeatable real-world benchmarking. Evaluating 12 leading GUI agents on MobileBench-OL shows significant room for improvement to meet real-world requirements. Human evaluation further confirms that MobileBench-OL can reliably measure the performance of leading GUI agents in real environments.

Scarce data or datasets dominated by out-of-distribution (OOD) areas exacerbate this issue. Our theoretical analysis and experiments show that the standard squared error objective induces a harmful TD cross covariance. This effect amplifies in OOD areas, biasing optimization and degrading policy learning. To counteract this mechanism, we develop two complementary strategies: partitioned buffer sampling that restricts updates to localized replay partitions, attenuates irregular covariance effects, and aligns update directions, yielding a scheme that is easy to integrate with existing implementations, namely Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD (C^4). We also introduce an explicit gradient-based corrective penalty that cancels the covariance induced bias within each update. We prove that buffer partitioning preserves the lower bound property of the maximization objective, and that these constraints mitigate excessive conservatism in extreme OOD areas without altering the core behavior of policy constrained offline reinforcement learning.

To address these limitations, this paper presents multimodal multi agent ransomware analysis framework designed for ransomware classification. Proposed multimodal multiagent architecture combines information from static, dynamic and network sources. Each data type is handled by specialized agent that uses auto encoder based feature extraction. These representations are then integrated through a fusion agent. After that fused representation are used by transformer based classifier. It identifies the specific ransomware family. The agents interact through an interagent feedback mechanism that iteratively refines feature representations by suppressing low confidence information. The framework was evaluated on large scale datasets containing thousands of ransomware and benign samples. Multiple experiments were conducted on ransomware dataset. It outperforms single modality and nonadaptive fusion baseline achieving improvement of up to 0.936 in Macro-F1 for family classification and reducing calibration error. Over 100 epochs, the agentic feedback loop displays a stable monotonic convergence leading to over +0.75 absolute improvement in terms of agent quality and a final composite score of around 0.88 without fine tuning of the language models.

This structure prioritizes bounded long-horizon behavior under fully autoregressive inference, a critical requirement for edge deployment where prediction errors accumulate over time. Experiments on non-stationary synthetic time-series data demonstrate that COMET-SG1 achieves competitive short-horizon accuracy while exhibiting significantly reduced long-horizon drift compared to MLP, LSTM, and k-nearest neighbor baselines.

In such settings, black-box copying provides a practical refactoring mechanism, i.e. upgrading legacy models by learning replicas from input-output queries alone. When restricted to hard-label outputs, copying turns into a discontinuous surface reconstruction problem from pointwise queries, severely limiting the ability to recover boundary geometry efficiently. We propose a distance-based copying (distillation) framework that replaces hard-label supervision with signed distances to the teacher's decision boundary, converting copying into a smooth regression problem that exploits local geometry. We develop an $\u03b1$-governed smoothing and regularization scheme with H\u00f6lder/Lipschitz control over the induced target surface, and introduce two model-agnostic algorithms to estimate signed distances under label-only access.

REVQ combines a shared quantizer with dynamically routed expert quantizers that are activated according to the input audio, decoupling bitrate from codebook capacity and improving compression efficiency.

To address this, we introduce a conditional HPI for top-performing regions and derive a closed-form estimator that accurately reflects conditional activation and domain changes.

Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSelf - Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO)\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8fd8\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u96be\u9898\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLVR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4ece\u6bcf\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u800c\u8bb8\u591a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u73af\u5883\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "method": "\u5c06SDPO\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u628a\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u6211\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u628a\u5176\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u70bc\u56de\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7f16\u7a0b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cSDPO\u6bd4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684RLVR\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u4ec5\u8fd4\u56de\u6807\u91cf\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6807\u51c6RLVR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u96be\u9898\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "SDPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Contemporary learning techniques primarily focus on structured learning paths, knowledge tracing, and generic adaptive testing but fail to address real-time learning challenges driven by cognitive load, attention fluctuations, and engagement levels. Building on findings from a formative user study (N=66), we introduce GuideAI, a multi-modal framework that enhances LLM-driven learning by integrating real-time biosensory feedback including eye gaze tracking, heart rate variability, posture detection, and digital note-taking behavior. GuideAI dynamically adapts learning content and pacing through cognitive optimizations (adjusting complexity based on learning progress markers), physiological interventions (breathing guidance and posture correction), and attention-aware strategies (redirecting focus using gaze analysis). Additionally, GuideAI supports diverse learning modalities, including text-based, image-based, audio-based, and video-based instruction, across varied knowledge domains. A preliminary study (N = 25) assessed GuideAI's impact on knowledge retention and cognitive load through standardized assessments. The results show statistically significant improvements in both problem-solving capability and recall-based knowledge assessments. Participants also experienced notable reductions in key NASA-TLX measures including mental demand, frustration levels, and effort, while simultaneously reporting enhanced perceived performance.

In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings.

We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus.

Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the \"Big Two\" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for \"agency\" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for \"communion.\" This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based.

Although recent advances in neural and digital signal processing-based watermarking methods have improved imperceptibility and embedding capacity, robustness is still primarily assessed against conventional distortions such as compression, additive noise, and resampling. However, the rise of deep learning-based attacks introduces novel and significant threats to watermark security. In this work, we investigate self voice conversion as a universal, content-preserving attack against audio watermarking systems.

While existing frameworks offer partial solutions, they are constrained by oversimplified semantic representations and a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Semantic Intent Decoding (SID), a novel framework that translates neural activity into natural language by modeling meaning as a flexible set of compositional semantic units. SID is built on three core principles: semantic compositionality, continuity and expandability of semantic space, and fidelity in reconstruction. We present BrainMosaic, a deep learning architecture implementing SID. BrainMosaic decodes multiple semantic units from EEG/SEEG signals using set matching and then reconstructs coherent sentences through semantic-guided reconstruction. This approach moves beyond traditional pipelines that rely on fixed-class classification or unconstrained generation, enabling a more interpretable and expressive communication paradigm.

In particular, the standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, typically composed of multilayer perceptrons, struggles to model relationships between features, especially when handling mixed data types. In contrast, Transformers, through their attention mechanism, are better suited for capturing complex feature interactions. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE. We conduct experiments on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite and draw two main conclusions.

Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A corpus of 12,000 synthetic audio samples was generated using the Daily-Dialog dataset and evaluated against four detection frameworks, including semantic, structural, and signal-level approaches. The results reveal significant variability in detector performance across generative mechanisms: models effective against one TTS architecture may fail against others, particularly LLM-based synthesis.

These challenges become particularly acute in the context of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), as high-dimensional visual inputs are transformed into extensive token sequences, thereby inflating the key-value (KV) cache and imposing substantial data movement overheads to the LLM backbone. To address these issues, we present CHIME, a chiplet-based heterogeneous near-memory acceleration for edge MLLMs inference. CHIME leverages the complementary strengths of integrated monolithic 3D (M3D) DRAM and RRAM chiplets: DRAM supplies low-latency bandwidth for attention, while RRAM offers dense, non-volatile storage for weights. This heterogeneous hardware is orchestrated by a co-designed mapping framework that executes fused kernels near data, minimizing cross-chiplet traffic to maximize effective bandwidth. On FastVLM (0.6B/1.7B) and MobileVLM (1.7B/3B), CHIME achieves up to 54x speedup and up to 246x better energy efficiency per inference as compared to the edge GPU NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX. It sustains 116.5-266.5 token/J compared to Jetson's 0.7-1.1 token/J. Furthermore, it delivers up to 69.2x higher throughput than the state-of-the-art PIM accelerator FACIL.

The interactions within these systems often lead to extreme events whose origins remain obscured by the black box of emergence. Interpreting these events is critical for system safety. This paper proposes the first framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, aiming to answer three fundamental questions: When does the event originate? Who drives it? And what behaviors contribute to it? Specifically, we adapt the Shapley value to faithfully attribute the occurrence of extreme events to each action taken by agents at different time steps, i.e., assigning an attribution score to the action to measure its influence on the event.

Although unsupervised speaker diarization is inherently challenging, the prospect of identifying speaker regions without pretraining or weak supervision motivates research on clustering techniques. In this work, we share the notable observation that measuring multiple kernel similarities of speaker embeddings to thereafter craft a sparse graph for spectral clustering in a principled manner is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performances in a fully unsupervised setting. Specifically, we consider four polynomial kernels and a degree one arccosine kernel to measure similarities in speaker embeddings, using which sparse graphs are constructed in a principled manner to emphasize local similarities.

This work reviews various training paradigm and evaluates the robustness of state-of-the-art ReID models in cross-domain applications and examines the role of foundation models in improving generalization through richer, more transferable visual representations. We compare three training paradigms, supervised, self-supervised, and language-aligned models. Through the study the aim is to answer the following questions: Can supervised models generalize in cross-domain scenarios? How does foundation models like SigLIP2 perform for the ReID tasks? What are the weaknesses of current supervised and foundational models for ReID? We have conducted the analysis across 11 models and 9 datasets.

However, existing human-in-the-loop RL (HiL-RL) frameworks often suffer from low sample efficiency, requiring substantial human interventions to achieve convergence and thereby leading to high labor costs. To address this, we propose a sample-efficient real-world human-in-the-loop RL framework named \\method, which requires fewer human intervention by actively selecting informative samples. Specifically, stable reduction of policy entropy enables improved trade-off between exploration and exploitation with higher sample efficiency. We first build influence functions of different samples on the policy entropy, which is efficiently estimated by the covariance of action probabilities and soft advantages of policies. Then we select samples with moderate values of influence functions, where shortcut samples that induce sharp entropy drops and noisy samples with negligible effect are pruned. Extensive experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that \\method achieves a 42.1\\% higher success rate while requiring 10.1\\% fewer human interventions compared to the state-of-the-art HiL-RL method, validating its effectiveness.

Using the FABRIC testbed with NVIDIA A30 GPUs, we tested five standard Llama models and five Llama Guard variants on 100 adversarial prompts covering ten vulnerability categories. Our results reveal significant differences in security performance: the compact Llama-Guard-3-1B model achieved the highest detection rate of 76% with minimal latency (0.165s per test), whereas base models such as Llama-3.1-8B failed to detect threats (0% accuracy) despite longer inference times (0.754s).

In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction.

Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant ``label bottleneck,\" requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes. Our results indicate that the inductive bias from audio pre-training allows superior feature extraction compared to traditional supervised techniques, offering a robust, data-efficient pathway for discovering new, anomalous transients, and classifying complex noise artifacts in the era of next-generation detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5e94\u53d8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790LIGO\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5e72\u6270\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u6807\u7b7e\u74f6\u9888\u2019\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u5e72\u6270\u5f62\u6001\u6216\u5947\u5f02\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08AST\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u58f0\u97f3\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7528t - SNE\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790LIGO\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7b2c\u4e09\u3001\u56db\u8f6e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0cAST\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u5d4c\u5165\u826f\u597d\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u4e0eGravity Spy\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u7c7b\u522b\u543b\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u97f3\u9891\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4f7f\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u77ac\u53d8\u548c\u590d\u6742\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions.

The results show that the important structures are predominantly located in the near-wall region and are more frequently associated with sweep-type events. In the viscous layer, the SHAP structures relevant for production and viscous diffusion are almost entirely contained within those relevant for dissipation, revealing a clear hierarchical organization of near-wall turbulence. In the outer layer, this hierarchical organization breaks down and only velocity-pressure-gradient correlation and turbulent transport SHAP structures remain, with a moderate spatial coincidence of approximately $60\\%$. Finally, we show that none of the coherent structures classically studied in turbulence are capable of representing the mechanisms behind the various terms of the turbulent kinetic energy budget throughout the channel.

Experiments were conducted on a curated subset of MIMIC III, (four structured tables and one clinical note type), using a mix of locally hosted and API-based LLMs. Evaluation combined exact-match metrics, semantic similarity, and human judgment.

However, adapting such large-scale models is computationally expensive and still relies on substantial Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations. We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision. Specifically, the teacher conducts dense supervision through point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, with an estimate of decision reliability. Guided by these signals, the student learns the teacher's quality perception patterns through joint distillation and is calibrated on a small MOS subset to align with human annotations. Experiments on both user-generated and AI-generated IQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the need for human annotations while maintaining strong MOS-aligned correlations, making lightweight IQA practical under limited annotation budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLEAF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4eceMLLM\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u5148\u9a8c\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u56de\u5f52\u5668\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eMLLM\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cfMOS\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\u662fMOS\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLEAF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u70b9\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u8fdb\u884c\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u5b66\u4e60\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5c0fMOS\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u548cAI\u751f\u6210\u7684IQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7IQA\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

For case (i), we prove linear convergence in expectation of the objective function values to any prescribed tolerance using an adaptive stepsize. For case (ii), we develop a fully problem parameter-free and adaptive stepsize scheme that yields an $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ worst-case rate in expectation. The infeasibility of the iterates decreases geometrically with the number of feasibility updates almost surely, while for the averaged iterates, we establish an expected lower bound on the function values relative to the optimal value that depends on the distribution for the random number of sampled constraints.

Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms).

We investigate whether explicit information about a subject's gender or sexuality influences LLM responses across three subject categories: queer-marked, non-queer-marked, and the normalized \"unmarked\" category. Representational imbalances are operationalized as measurable differences in English sentence completions across four dimensions: sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Our findings show that Masked Language Models (MLMs) produce the least favorable sentiment, higher toxicity, and more negative regard for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate these patterns, while closed-access ARLMs tend to produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects. Results suggest that LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, though the form and degree of bias depend strongly on specific model characteristics, which may redistribute, but not eliminate, representational harms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u518d\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u53ca\u4ea7\u751f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u518d\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f02\u6027\u604b\u548c\u987a\u6027\u522b\u89c4\u8303\uff09\u53ca\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u4f53\u6027\u522b\u6216\u6027\u53d6\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e0a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u82f1\u6587\u53e5\u5b50\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u8861\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u63a9\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9177\u513f\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3b\u4f53\u4ea7\u51fa\u6700\u4e0d\u5229\u60c5\u611f\u7b49\uff1b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\uff1b\u95ed\u6e90\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3b\u4f53\u4ea7\u51fa\u66f4\u6709\u5bb3\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u518d\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u504f\u5dee\u53ea\u662f\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u800c\u975e\u6d88\u9664\u3002"}}

Conventional static resource allocation often leads to overprovisioning or underprovisioning due to the dynamic nature of traffic loads and application demands. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid forecast-driven Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines predictive intelligence with SFC provisioning. Specifically, we leverage DRL to generate datasets capturing DC resource utilization and service demands, which are then used to train deep learning forecasting models. Using Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization, the best-performing models, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, Temporal Graph Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory, are combined into an ensemble to enhance stability and accuracy. The ensemble predictions are integrated into the DC selection process, enabling proactive placement decisions that consider both current and future resource availability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only sustains high acceptance ratios for resource-intensive services such as Cloud Gaming and VoIP but also significantly improves acceptance ratios for latency-critical categories such as Augmented Reality increases from 30% to 50%, while Industry 4.0 improves from 30% to 45%. Consequently, the prediction-based model achieves significantly lower E2E latencies of 20.5%, 23.8%, and 34.8% reductions for VoIP, Video Streaming, and Cloud Gaming, respectively.

We first analyze demographic bias in T2V models and show that it primarily originates from pretrained text encoders, which encode implicit gender associations even for neutral prompts. We quantify this effect with a gender-leaning score that correlates with bias in generated videos.\n  Based on this insight, FairT2V mitigates demographic bias by neutralizing prompt embeddings via anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations while preserving semantics. To maintain temporal coherence, we apply debiasing only during early identity-forming steps through a dynamic denoising schedule.

However, recent black-box forgery attacks, where an attacker needs at least one watermarked image and black-box access to the provider's model, can embed the provider's watermark into images not produced by the provider, posing outsized risk to provenance and trust. We propose SemBind, the first defense framework for latent-based watermarks that resists black-box forgery by binding latent signals to image semantics via a learned semantic masker. Trained with contrastive learning, the masker yields near-invariant codes for the same prompt and near-orthogonal codes across prompts; these codes are reshaped and permuted to modulate the target latent before any standard latent-based watermark. SemBind is generally compatible with existing latent-based watermarking schemes and keeps image quality essentially unchanged, while a simple mask-ratio parameter offers a tunable trade-off between anti-forgery strength and robustness.

Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as \"sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., \"increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6846\u67b6FunHSI\uff0c\u89e3\u51b33D\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e3D\u573a\u666f\u529f\u80fd\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u6216\u529f\u80fd\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFunHSI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u63a5\u89e6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba13D\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u5b8c\u55843D\u4eba\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "FunHSI\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u5408\u6210\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u901a\u75283D\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u529f\u80fd\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "FunHSI\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002"}}

We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance.

However, existing RSC techniques often fail to generalize beyond narrow operational conditions due to limited sensing modalities and datasets that lack environmental diversity. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u548cROAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8def\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u56e0\u4f20\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u5c42\uff1b\u63a8\u51fa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6ROAD\uff0c\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728PVS\u57fa\u51c6\u548cROAD\u5b50\u96c6\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u7c7bF1\u5206\u6570\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u673a\u548cIMU\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8def\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

These structures can be naturally represented by graphs, and the task of inferring such graphs from data is known as graph learning or as causal discovery if the graphs are given a causal interpretation. Existing approaches typically rely on restrictive assumptions about the data-generating process, employ greedy oracle algorithms, or solve approximate formulations of the graph learning problem. As a result, they are either sensitive to violations of central assumptions or fail to guarantee globally optimal solutions. We address these limitations by introducing a nonparametric graph learning framework based on nonparametric conditional independence testing and integer programming. We reformulate the graph learning problem as an integer-programming problem and prove that solving the integer-programming problem provides a globally optimal solution to the original graph learning problem. Our method leverages efficient encodings of graphical separation criteria, enabling the exact recovery of larger graphs than was previously feasible.

From the resulting output one can compute representations of the corresponding Markov equivalence classes or weak equivalence classes.

First, we present a fast and fully unsupervised strategy for online data reduction based on reconstruction-based anomaly detection. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images (i.e. frames acquired with GEM amplification disabled) learns the detector noise morphology and highlights particle-induced structures through localized reconstruction residuals, from which compact Regions of Interest (ROIs) are extracted. On real prototype data, the selected configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with ~25 ms per-frame inference time on a consumer GPU.\n  Second, we report a weakly supervised application of the Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) framework to data acquired with an Americium--Beryllium neutron source. Using only mixed AmBe and standard datasets (no event-level labels), a convolutional classifier learns to identify nuclear-recoil-like topologies.

A widely used strategy is the adoption of Open Boundary Conditions (OBC), which restores ergodic sampling of topology but at the price of breaking translation invariance and introducing unphysical boundary artifacts. In this contribution we summarize a scalable, exact flow-based strategy to remove them by transporting configurations from a prior with a OBC defect to a fully periodic ensemble, and apply it to 4d SU(3) Yang--Mills theory. The method is based on a Stochastic Normalizing Flow (SNF) that alternates non-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates with localized, gauge-equivariant defect coupling layers implemented via masked parametric stout smearing. Training is performed by minimizing the average dissipated work, equivalent to a Kullback--Leibler divergence between forward and reverse non-equilibrium path measures, to achieve more reversible trajectories and improved efficiency. We discuss the scaling with the number of degrees of freedom affected by the defect and show that defect SNFs achieve better performances than purely stochastic non-equilibrium methods at comparable cost. Finally, we validate the approach by reproducing reference results for the topological susceptibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u501f\u52a9\u968f\u673a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\uff0c\u5c06\u5e26\u5f00\u653e\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u8f6c\u6362\u5230\u5168\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7cfb\u7efc\uff0c\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u683c\u70b9\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u8fde\u7eed\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u51bb\u7ed3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u7eaf\u968f\u673a\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6Markov Chain Monte Carlo\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u683c\u70b9\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u8d8b\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6781\u9650\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u51bb\u7ed3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u867d\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u62d3\u6251\u904d\u5386\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u7269\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\uff08SNF\uff09\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u5e73\u8861Monte Carlo\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u53c2\u6570\u5316stout\u6d82\u62b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u7b49\u4ef7\u7f3a\u9677\u8026\u5408\u5c42\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5e73\u5747\u8017\u6563\u529f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u7f3a\u9677SNFs\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u6bd4\u7eaf\u968f\u673a\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u62d3\u6251\u78c1\u5316\u7387\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7cbe\u786e\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u754c\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this work, we demonstrate that a simple utilization of a second-order quasi-Newton optimizer, \\textbf{SOAP}, dramatically improves both training efficiency and final performance across diverse LICs. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that Newton preconditioning inherently resolves the intra-step and inter-step update conflicts intrinsic to the R-D objective, facilitating faster, more stable convergence. Beyond acceleration, we uncover a critical deployability benefit: second-order trained models exhibit significantly fewer activation and latent outliers. This substantially enhances robustness to post-training quantization.

While most data-driven forecasting approaches rely primarily on historical data from a single country, such data are often limited in length and variability, restricting the performance of machine learning (ML) models. In this work, we investigate a cross-country learning approach for infectious disease forecasting, in which a single model is trained on time series data from multiple countries and evaluated on a country of interest. This setting enables the model to exploit shared epidemic dynamics across countries and to benefit from an enlarged training set. We examine this approach through a case study on COVID-19 case forecasting in Cyprus, using surveillance data from European countries. We evaluate multiple ML models and analyse the impact of the lookback window length and cross-country `data augmentation' on multi-step forecasting performance. Our results show that incorporating data from other countries can lead to consistent improvements over models trained solely on national data.

However, the growing availability of hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has made low-precision formats attractive due to their superior performance, reduced memory footprint, and improved energy efficiency. In this work, we investigate the role of mixed-precision arithmetic in neural-network based Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), a widely used method for solving computationally otherwise intractable quantum many-body systems. We first derive general analytical bounds on the error introduced by reduced precision on Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, and then empirically validate these bounds on the use-case of VMC. We demonstrate that significant portions of the algorithm, in particular, sampling the quantum state, can be executed in half precision without loss of accuracy. More broadly, this work provides a theoretical framework to assess the applicability of mixed-precision arithmetic in machine-learning approaches that rely on MCMC sampling. In the context of VMC, we additionally demonstrate the practical effectiveness of mixed-precision strategies, enabling more scalable and energy-efficient simulations of quantum many-body systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\uff08VMC\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5728VMC\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f9d\u8d56\u53cc\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4f7f\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u683c\u5f0f\u56e0\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u4f18\u52bf\u53d8\u5f97\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684VMC\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u63a8\u5bfc\u7b80\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5728Metropolis - Hastings MCMC\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5206\u6790\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u518d\u5728VMC\u7528\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u5728\u534a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eMCMC\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u5728VMC\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Motivated by this phenomenon, we ask: how do transformers learn to associate information across modalities from in-context examples? We investigate this question through controlled experiments on small transformers trained on synthetic classification tasks, enabling precise manipulation of data statistics and model architecture. We begin by revisiting core principles of unimodal ICL in modern transformers. While several prior findings replicate, we find that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) increases the data complexity threshold for ICL. Extending to the multimodal setting reveals a fundamental learning asymmetry: when pretrained on high-diversity data from a primary modality, surprisingly low data complexity in the secondary modality suffices for multimodal ICL to emerge. Mechanistic analysis shows that both settings rely on an induction-style mechanism that copies labels from matching in-context exemplars; multimodal training refines and extends these circuits across modalities.

Here, we study the dynamics of these representations: how representations evolve along these dimensions within the context of (simulated) conversations. We find that linear representations can change dramatically over a conversation; for example, information that is represented as factual at the beginning of a conversation can be represented as non-factual at the end and vice versa. These changes are content-dependent; while representations of conversation-relevant information may change, generic information is generally preserved. These changes are robust even for dimensions that disentangle factuality from more superficial response patterns, and occur across different model families and layers of the model. These representation changes do not require on-policy conversations; even replaying a conversation script written by an entirely different model can produce similar changes. However, adaptation is much weaker from simply having a sci-fi story in context that is framed more explicitly as such. We also show that steering along a representational direction can have dramatically different effects at different points in a conversation. These results are consistent with the idea that representations may evolve in response to the model playing a particular role that is cued by a conversation. Our findings may pose challenges for interpretability and steering -- in particular, they imply that it may be misleading to use static interpretations of features or directions, or probes that assume a particular range of features consistently corresponds to a particular ground-truth value.
